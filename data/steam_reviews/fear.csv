76561197999938574,1719182879,True,"Back in 2005 F.E.A.R. looked and played amazingly well: a mix of bullet-time shooter with horror worked great despite linear boxy locations and very limited amount of enemies. Visual effects during slowmo and pretty clever (by the time) AI made the shooting sequences amazing.

But it didn't age well: while the fights are still ok, horror moments are not scary at all, and the majority of NPCs look really cringy. Still, I enjoyed replaying the game almost 20 years later, but I am not sure if the new audience will accept it. However, even 20 years later F.E.A.R. is one of the best shooters with slowo, so even you are younger that the game, I recommend you to try it. It takes some time to get into to, but when you do, it's hard to stop playing."

76561199236088870,1719111023,True,"extremely fun and honestly would recommend if you can just get the base game, the bundle is not worth its price even if its on sale. I wish though pistol ammunition was easier to get so I can dual-wield pistols more often."
76561198057575452,1719105122,True,"this gggame is a gggreat culmination of fear and action, while the horror is there, you also et a slow mo mode, and a physics based combat system, you can gggib your enemires asunder, the game doesnt hold up much now a days, but if you enjoy ggameplay over graphics then this game is a must play."

76561198043078299,1719072037,True,One of my favorite old shooters games that still has some pretty good AI and make me unreasonable scared when playing it
76561199435554172,1719038762,True,"This is my first time playing F.E.A.R and I have to say I am genuinely impressed. From the gore and environment to enemies flipping over couches to take cover from your gunfire, it is an amazing experience. I feel like some games nowadays could learn a thing or two from F.E.A.R."
76561198126755317,1718866077,True,"yeah, don't pay full price for it; got all of the games for 1 dilla. super great game, i honestly couldn't recommend it more to someone wanting an old, but good; linear shooter."

76561198027075157,1718820795,True,"A masterpiece ( with forgivable flaws ) that I played for the first time in 2024. Still impressive visuals. Combat drags on later, but the humanoid combatants still do some occasional impressive tricks that is completely missed in many games from the period and even now; also when the combat was novel earlier in the game it really impressed. 

Also it's worth letting the credits roll when finished, don't just alt-f4."
76561199041003913,1718809458,True,"F.E.A.R is Master Piece which has set benchmark in many aspects when it got released, Gameplay and story is nice, just sit back and enjoy game, worth experiencing this amazing game.

Graphics is still good, back in 2005 this game graphics was top notch."
76561198209079220,1718809162,True,Very good fps-shooter game of its time with nice mechanics and interesting horror vibes.
76561198007259678,1718751034,True,"YES, one of the best old school horror shooters.
Definitively worth a play through, i can recommend!

The MP was/is something truly awesome, true skill based MP with a steep learning curve.
Extremely rewarding once one get good at the MP."

76561198112586418,1718593360,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of my favorite games ever made. The gun-play consistently makes you feel like an absolute bad-ass. It's frenetic and brutal and it feels heavily inspired by John Woo movies. The enemy AI is excellent and every encounter usually plays out differently if you reload a save. Watching them try to flank you and communicate with each other is very satisfying. The only thing more satisfying is decapitating them with a shotgun blast or using a particle beam to turn them into blackened skeletons. The combat has a kick to it that the majority of games lack nowadays, as well as back then. The combination of excellent sound design and particle effects flying from every object you shoot makes for a visually striking game despite its age.

The horror is excellent too. It can be predictable at times but the game focuses on getting under your skin for the entirety of the runtime. There's lots of unsettling imagery and the tone is consistently creepy throughout. There are some good scares throughout too, and while some are more effective than others I would say it succeeds overall. The idea of John Woo style combat in a horror setting is an unusual one, but it's one that I think works quite well. I've had a blast playing through this game several times now and I plan to replay it for many years to come.

Seems I can't review the expansions separately, but both Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate are worth your time as well. They each add new levels which are highlights of the series, as well as new enemy types and weapons to play around with. Both are great companion pieces to the original F.E.A.R. and shouldn't be skipped."
76561198857122078,1718556144,True,Dope game
76561198217635055,1718527359,True,"Why don't we get any more games like this? 

Awesome shooter in a horror setting. Plenty of ammo and slow mo kicks & scary little girls. Its half john woo film & half horror however the AI is overrated. They will communicate and flank but its easy to outflank. The AI has held up but I think the best part of this game is the world."
76561197967510914,1718496447,True,"Competent corridor shooter, I remember wanting to play this game but not having a PC with the muscle to play it, played through it with work laptop that has some lame ass business level graphics card, GLORIOUS! The game's main protagonist has slow-mo powers that you can use on the fly, which can lead to it being a bit too easy but at the same time, a sense that your in a John Woo film choreographing your own gun battles.(You sluts even know who John Woo is?) Anyways, some of the younger gen might not dig what I guess could be dated gaming mechanics/graphics, but I honestly think it was still a good trip, so fuck'em. Now on to the expansions before going on to the second game in the series. 

May the dark powers of the Necronomicon  guide you all in your gaming endeavors!

76561198841796245,1718387143,True,An amazing shooter with an anxiety inducing horror atmosphere. not really a horror game but if you can get immersed those scares will get you. my one problem with it is the antagonists have a background that makes me feel really sympathetic. and /spoiler being forced to kill fettel and shoot alma's ghost kinda made me feel guilty cause their characterization is really good and honestly a lot of their actions in the story are pretty justified.
76561198258041191,1718360223,True,best shotgun in any game
76561198040054535,1718336421,True,"A solid old school shooter. It's not trying to do too much and pulls off what it is doing quite well. I pretty quickly understood why the game gets mentioned and complemented on the enemy AI. They take cover, they flank, they're pretty accurate and pose a very real threat in most encounters. I couldn't get the idea of this being Half Life plus horror out of my head. Some of the level design, shooting, physics, and movement felt very like that of HL. All in all, a pretty solid horror fps, that both makes you feel very powerful at times yet still manages to keep my hair standing up at times.

I am a mega scaredy cat when it comes to horror and I did ""okay"", not super friendly, but not too in your face.
Needs a couple easy tweaks to play well on modern hardware."

One thing to keep in mind is to check the community guides to get the game to run correctly but after all done it seems more stunning then when it came out"
76561198344097530,1718158695,True,"I would say this is one of the best horror games of all time. It is a masterclass in how to balance action with horror in my opinion. The gunplay is similar to Counter Strike in which you need to control the bullet spread and recoil as well as know when to peek around corners. I really enjoyed the combat in this game. The mechanic that slows down time was interesting, but I only found myself using it when I was heavily outnumbered. The horror aspect of this game is amazing. Despite it being almost 20 years old, this game is genuinely unsettling and frightening all the way through. It is worth the money in my opinion."
76561198008987884,1718132958,True,One of the best FPS games ever. The GOAT!
76561198291103303,1718132915,True,Awesome game!

76561197998598944,1718049694,False,"Terrible framerate on a 4070 for some reason.  If you have newer hardware, beware."
76561197995179518,1718015306,True,"Play Fear 1 and ignore the rest of the series. Don't even think about the bundle unless you have morbid curiosity about how this IP got driven into the ground.

Fear represents a depressing timeline in which Half Life as a franchise was messed with by meddling executives and eventually chased the Call of Duty trend of the late 2000s and early 2010s. This game was a solid shooter released during a golden age for shooters along side Bioshock and shortly after Half Life 2 and Doom 3.

I recommend playing it in the dark, not cause of scares (They havent aged well), but more cause of it's tone. It's moody, dark and lonely and it just feels wrong to play in a well lit room.

It's more fun if you pretend this is a Resident Evil game with Umbrella being up to no good again, or being familiar with Akira.

I like that you don't have to hold onto weapons and can go nuts playing however you want as it doesn't really punish you for experimenting.

You will need a dll fix to fix frame rate issues and you may need to enable V-Sync as well at which point the game runs fine (Or at least it ran fine on my AMD card, it didnt run well on my Nvidia card).

But yeah, dont bother with the sequels unless you want to be really depressed about they fucked over the IP in the worst possible way.

Massive ups to G for helping with setting everything up <3(:"
76561197991699085,1717900846,True,"It's interesting to come back and play this game nearly 20 years after it's release and see the ways in which it impacted FPS gaming as a whole. The complex AI it introduced, the effective ""bullet time"" mechanics, the mixture of horror and fast-paced combat - while it wasn't first to market with any of these it was definitely one people remember and praise for those combinations in a big budget hit.

It's also interesting to see areas where it hasn't aged as well, even in those exact same points. Having recently played Trepang2 and Necromunda: Hired Gun, bullet time doesn't feel as advantageous or impactful, the movement is almost sluggish. I spent 5 minutes trying to work out why my character was stuck on ""walk"" speed before realising that it wasn't, that's just the pace to which I'm limited. I eventually only used bullet time to line up my shots before switching it off as it didn't give me a fun ""flow"" feeling.

I wouldn't say those are gripes though, I remember loving the speed and bullet time when I first played but it's so interesting to see how developers have built off those over time, sanded off rough edges and polished such mechanics turning a lustre into a shine as the field progresses."
76561198880469735,1717791872,False,"The game is absolutely amazing but I can't stand having to get out my my chair to unplug and replug my mouse every 10 minutes to reset the progressively terrible framerate just because I decided to get a Logitech mouse, the framerate makes the game unplayable and having to check on it every so often makes the game a chore more than an experience."

76561197960589796,1717674265,True,"""F.E.A.R."" is like that one friend who loves horror movies and always suggests watching them in the dark. It's the game that combines intense first-person combat with a psychological thriller, creating an atmosphere that's as thick as pea soup.

The game's acronym stands for First Encounter Assault Recon, but it might as well stand for ""Freaky Events Afoot, Run!"" You're part of an elite squad dealing with supernatural phenomena, and let's just say, the job description didn't mention ghostly little girls.

The combat is a ballet of bullets, where time slows down just enough for you to appreciate the artistry of flying lead. It's like the Matrix had a baby with a haunted house, and you're invited to the christening.

The AI enemies? They're smarter than your average bear—or zombie. They flank, they take cover, and they make you work for every inch of progress. It's like playing chess with a poltergeist; they're always two steps ahead.

In essence, ""F.E.A.R."" is a masterclass in mood. It's a game that whispers sweet nothings in your ear, then screams in your face when you least expect it. So, grab your nightlight and your teddy bear; it's time to face your fears. Just remember, it's all fun and games until someone gets spooked. 👻🎮💥"

76561198111651188,1717097095,True,"Classic shooter known for its atmosphere. The gunplay itself a bit dated though the ai is pretty good especially for 2005. The campaign will probably take you around 6-8 hours, recommend playing on medium or hard since i only died like twice on medium difficulty. the greatest part of this game in my opinion is the level design, it maps can feel large and maze-like yet itll still make sense where you have to go almost every time, never had to use a walkthrough despite the games age. 

Unfortunately the sprawling map design kind of goes away as the game goes on, and by the end its pretty much completely linear. It's not really a horror shooter like it portrays but it has a darker atmosphere and even darker lighting. AI can feel unfair at points where they have i-frames during animations like vaulting or throwing grenades, and some are super tanky for some reason like the god damn turrets and drones. 

Overall 7.5/10, pretty good even for a modern experience. Install a infinite flashlight mod before you start your save cause that feature  added nothing to the game other than having stand still and wait and its annoying as hell"

the best thing about fear is manipulating the lithtech engine props when you quick save and slightly move your mouse so they ragdoll, there are so many props and light sources (which look good mind you) and i'm just sat here getting endless hours of entertainment like a child"

76561198039620401,1716587505,True,"F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon), released by Monolith Productions in 2005. This gem
still delivers a gripping and unique experience. The game blends intense first-person shooter action with psychological horror, creating an atmosphere that keeps you on edge throughout.

The story revolves around a mysterious little girl named Alma, whose psychic powers have unleashed chaos. The narrative unfolds through environmental clues, creepy messages, and eerie hallucinations, keeping you engaged and curious.

Despite its age, F.E.A.R.'s graphics hold up well, especially the impressive lighting effects that enhance the horror element. The sound design is outstanding, with unsettling ambient noises and chilling whispers that make playing with headphones a must.

The gameplay is a perfect balance of intense firefights and nerve-wracking horror moments. The enemy AI is smart and challenging, and the slow-motion mechanic adds a strategic layer to the combat. Just when you start feeling comfortable, the game throws in a creepy apparition or sudden scare to keep your heart racing.

F.E.A.R. remains a standout title for its atmospheric storytelling, intelligent AI, and genuinely creepy ambiance. It's an unforgettable experience that still holds its own against modern games and is well worth revisiting."
76561199022468261,1716579541,True,I bought a key for this game specifically and all the dlc without getting the crappy stuff yippie
76561198148562436,1716531794,True,good game
76561199124007952,1716506810,True,Paranoid schizophrenia simulator
76561198176225226,1716443249,True,"I don't really feel to strongly about this game, it's a mediocre horror game, the story is mid and the gameplay is good but it's a tad janky. I know that it's came out a long time ago at this point and it has held up remarkably well but I wouldn't play it over anything else. It is VERY old....and playing old games is neat?"
76561198283764127,1716410062,False,"My first time playing the game. I love it, it's genuinely phenomenal, I played it through on extreme to really get the most out of the A.I because a lot of people went on about the A.I, yeah they're really fun to fight against. game looks nice, sounds good, feels good. Really great game.

Now, you're probably wondering why I'm not recommending this after talking about how much I love it, fair question, because...

This shit right here is a scam. The fact that I can't buy the first game with it's DLC separately to the rest of the franchise is a stupid mistake on the part of whoever is responsible for it being sold this way. Doesn't bother me though, I just bought the product I actually wanted and not what I didn't want off a totally legitimate and professional key selling site for 99p. Your loss.

Either way, Get the game, the game good"
76561198805721953,1716315395,True,"F.E.A.R is often regarded as one of the greatest fps games of our time and I can finally see why. 

The atmosphere, the lighting, the music, the enemy AI, the combat, it has so many strong points. This game is a technical marvel in my opinion. The kind of realistic physics, lighting, fog and particle effects that are on display can put even 2024 games to shame. Every light source reacts realistically, every object has a weight and physics to it, grenades can cause huge fogs that react realistically to bullets, bullet casings can bounce around depending on the surface, different surfaces cause difference kinds of particle effects when interacted with, the list goes on. But above all that, the best achievement of this game is the enemy AI. I have no idea how they managed to create such a complex system back then. Enemies are unpredictable, strategic and smart. They can flank you, change positions frequently, interact with objects around them to create cover, call out positions, throw grenades accurately, run away when they feel outgunned, hide from the player and attack us off guard. It's insane how realistic it is. I have heard the sequels don't really capture the same feeling of this game but I'll try to be optimistic

The game also has a very compelling and mysterious story. It makes you want to seek out audio logs and other collectables around the map to know more about the world. It feels like a beginning to a much grander story, The entire story was a setup to what's to come. I am very curious to see what happens next. But I did feel like it stretched itself a bit too much. You can easily take out some levels and nothing would change. But that would mean that it's a smaller game.

The only real issue I have with the game is the horror, it didn't age very well. The jump scares are low poly images and the moments they happen are very predictable, When things like this happen, you need to keep in mind that this is a 2005 game and by those standards, this must've been quite scary.

In conclusion, I highly recommend that everyone try this game out. It has great action, immersive atmosphere, an engaging story and above all else, shows how much passion and innovation went into creating games back then."
76561199046973702,1716272173,True,Perfect.
76561197966581537,1716238037,True,Classic
76561198021613468,1716236686,True,"F.E.A.R. has great shooting and an interesting horror vibe, but the environments are boring and the characters are lackluster. Get this one cheap."
76561198121709059,1716180240,True,For a game made in 2005 this has INCREDIBLE graphics for the time! Story slaps too!
76561198381191618,1716102949,True,"Fantastic game, buy it now."
76561198126439224,1716083906,True,"Very unique game, lots of fun"

76561199506855826,1716076051,True,What does motherless do to this mfs.
76561198101615964,1716055424,True,"Pretty good game despite its age. The graphics that used to be crisp and impressive back in the day have aged considerably and look somewhat dull compared to more recent titles as one would expect, but they are still serviceable nevertheless, and the gameplay is fun with all the old school goodness, indulgence and attention to detail that folks used to expect from new game titles in the past.

The atmosphere is great with scripted events that both set the tone for eeriness and make the AI feel more threatening and intuitive than it really is. I am talking squads of armed dudes bursting into a room and flipping down bookshelves and cabinets to use for cover in massive, loud shootouts. The horror parts are hit or miss with lots of jumpscares woven into the game, some are creepy but personally only 2 or 3 got to me early on because I wasn’t expecting them.

The particle effects of bullet impacts during the shooting mayhems of this game are STILL peak, and are absolutely timeless, and a joy to behold. You shoot at windows and framed glass displays and the glass bursts in a shower of crunchy shards falling by your feet. Paper stacks explode into swaying confetti when shot at, enemies are torn limb from limb, splaying blood in all directions as severed legs land on the floor, shot metal surfaces sprinkle collision sparks, electronics go boom and are set aflame while shooting at walls covers the room in a suffocating fog of concrete dust that makes it impossible to track down enemies as they quietly reposition or crawl closer to you for the kill. It’s great to watch all of that in slow motion while unloading an entire magazine of SMG at everything that moves.

The plot was interesting enough to hold my interest but, there were a lot of unresolved questions by the end and no explanation was given about most things, which left me feeling disappointed as I wanted to learn more about the paranormal phenomena taking place in the game.

There are some semi-secret areas in the game to reward player exploration. The areas award the inquisitive player with permanent health booster shots, recorded voice messages and computer files containing some lore tidbits here and there. I really like the practices of older games that back in the day used to include secret areas in the games and extra content for the players to discover and enjoy, I really appreciate the effort.

TL/DR: Buy it, you can shoot a mindcontrolled clone soldier's limb off with a shotgun in slow motion and watch it fly around the room shedding blood as enemies blast the walls around you into a fine fog of concrete dust and violence."
76561198438066944,1716002303,True,yes
76561198882571418,1715988839,True,"does a good job at being spooky, the gunplay combined with the smart AI and visceral blood effects make the combat fun and memorable. for a game this old, the graphics are quite good + pleasantly surprised how well this game works on modern hardware (doesn't even need a fan-made patch for things such as ultrawide)"
76561197983044086,1715888480,True,"These days people prattle on about Computer Enemy AI this and AI that.
 Let me tell you about F.E.A.R.
F.E.A.R. is short for First Encounter Assault Recon, the name of the unit that your character is apart of.  You character's name is ""Point Man"" and a ""point man"" is usually ""the first guy in the front of a squad."" But you'll be taking  on this adventure mostly alone.

Point Man has an interesting ability, lightning-fast reflexes. This is reflected by the fact that you have a button that slows down time for a short period of time.

You'll be tracking down a serial killer named Paxton Fettel, but he's more than just a serial killer. But you'll have an army of military clones to deal with before you can have a shot at him.

The enemy AI... these guys are brutal. even on lower difficulties they will ruin your day, so keep your wits sharp and your trigger finger ready.

The story is serviceable enough. This is one of the few horror games I actually enjoy playing, because I don't feel like I'm completely helpless."

76561198067918606,1715673471,True,To my friends: Play this game. it is such a good classic.
76561199383874443,1715656749,True,"Best Ai i ever seen.  They will work as a team. i've seen them flank whilst putting pressure on you. retreat when injured, call out whenever you attempt to flank. Wait for you to peek your head out behind cover and become wide open to their attack.   And much more.
 Why can't more games have this AI?"
76561198842841229,1715546352,True,"One of the best shooters of it's time. 

The game still has pretty great combat. The shotgun in this game is one of the best fps weapons ever. The flow of the levels is pretty good. The difficulty scaling is really good and the weapons feel amazing to use. The story and the plot twist were much better than expected.

That said, the game ages awfully in many areas. The subtitles are so small and the story is told in such a way that it makes it so unintresting and boring to follow it. You are much better off just watching a summary of Youtube. The levels are just so dark that they become irritating to go through. The game feels like a weird mix between action and horror but it mostly messes up the horror part.

Arguably the worst part of the game was how every area in a level looks and feels exactly similar. It makes going through the levels tiring and just plain boring. The levels just don't evolve that much from starting to end and the enemy variety is just not that great. 

Still, despite these flaws, the game is still very much worth playing if you like fps games. Its a good steal on a sale. And if you can get past these flaws, it's a really fun game.

76561199441848420,1715378205,True,"""This game isn't horror."" Is what I would've said if wasn't for what happened 5 hours into this game. After cleaning out a room filled with those replica assassin guys, a cutscene started to play, which showed the Pointman (protagonist) in the same room, standing over one of those replica assassin guys I mentioned. The assassin looked up into Pointmans face, the only thing he saw was his own reflection in pointmans red visor. The camera then panned onto the assassins face as he looked up at pointman, the sound of something unzipping can be heard, and what appears to be the shadow of a rod, slowly hovering over the assassins face as he begins to scream. The screen then quickly fades to black, the cutscene abruptly ends, and I'm now outside the room, the door closed and locked up tight behind me. I sit there, shaken to my very core, as I watched the pointman show that poor replica what true FEAR is.... Anyway, the game is alright I guess. Got a good spook out of me there, haha."
76561199001412639,1715349058,True,"Overwhelming game, took me almost 10 hours to complete, due to its hightly complicated AI on the max difficulty.

Anyways, moving away from WB being criminals, this game is really good. I'm not really a fan of fps games that much but taking that genre and combining it with psychological horror as well as just the most fun gunfights I've ever experienced in this kind of game and you've got something I'm beyond interested in. The slow-mo mechanic completely changes how you're able to approach situations and the AI is, as everyone knows by now, beyond top notch. As a final note, I'm genuinely shocked at just how well this game holds up graphically as well, it never really felt outdated in that department somehow despite being from 2005.

The most unintentionally funny game ever made"
76561198816414524,1714699930,True,"[h1] Introduction [/h1]
F.E.A.R is a first-person horror FPS that stands the test of time as one of the best and quintessential FPS games out there for its atmosphere, excellent use of lighting, sound effects and creates tension within the player as opposed to cheap jumpscares in most horror games these days. Despite the sequels not being up to par and instead dropping the quality of the franchise, it's still a blast to play through and a ton of fun.

[h1] Positives [/h1]
[list]
    [*]F.E.A.R opts for a less subtle approach to horror when compared to other horror games, going for more atmosphere and tension, so you don't get jumpscared as often. This works perfectly because it keeps the player invested and doesn't work to try and get them off the game because of some character that's in front of your screen. I will admit, there were times playing where I did get scared but it never steered me away, it was done to showcase the power of Fettel and Alma and for good reason (seeing she has telepathic abilities)
    [*]Gameplay is top-notch and exactly how I remembered it years ago! If you don't play F.E.A.R for the horror aspect, I would advise playing it for the gameplay and setting it to the lowest difficulty if you feel that higher difficulties make you more scared or worried. Reflexes or [b] bullet-time [/b] slows down everything around you, allowing you to shoot at normal-pace. The game is designed to be slow and tactical, so no going Max Payne here. At least on high and extreme difficulty anyway. Gunplay is great and all of the guns feel satisfying to use, pick your poison and knock yourself out! Some personal favourites of mine are the dual-wield pistols and the nail-gun, both incredibly strong and I'd argue overpowered
    [*]Boosters can be found during each level and increase both your health and reflexes respectively, encouraging player exploration
    [*]Level design is great, I found that there's always two paths to navigating to your objectives throughout majority of the game, including the DLCs! Some can lead to boosters, others to alternate paths to flank enemies, sneak past and provide cover just to name a few
    [*]Enemy variety is good, with a mix of humans and machines, ranging from your footsoldiers to your tech soldiers, machines with rockets, drones and freaking invisible ninjas
    [*]For any lore-fanatics out there, there are voice messages in-game that let you listen in on conversations and provide more insight into the world of F.E.A.R and the Origin Project. Wanted to give this a quick shout-out
    [*]The beauty of Source Engine is that even after years and years and years of a game being released, the game's still manages to look good. F.E.A.R is no exception and I don't know how I can describe it other than it looking great
    [*]Story is really good and shows what the wrath of a young girl who gets held for experiments because of her powers and loses her mother can do (seriously)
    [*]A bonus mention to being able to see your feet. In a 2005 game. This was INSANE for the time and I don't remember a lot of games back then doing this, so I thought it was cool to see
    [*]The A.I. My god the A.I in this game is good. No it's great! It's dynamic and sophisticated in that they can do an arrange of actions, such as diving back, kicking down tables for cover, running away from grenades, throwing grenades, jumping and climbing down ladders just to name a few. Incredibly ahead of its time in that department
[/list]

[h1] Negatives [/h1]
[list]
    [*]The game can be a pain to get running on modern systems. I kept getting an out of memory bug that despite upping my page file size and trying to install 4GB patch and LAA (which both didn't work for me), I just had to cope with it knowing that my game would crash every few chapters I completed. This also applies to the expansions as well. Thankfully this steam guide helped me get everything working and would recommend to make your game playable: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835341057
    [*]Game can feel repetitive at times with its visuals. You'll especially notice this if you play the DLCs one after the other
    [*]You can't buy the game separately. Instead you have to buy it with an overpriced bundle that includes the other games. [b] DO NOT BUY IT AT THIS PRICE! [/b] Either wait for a steam sale or buy it off of a third-party site.
[/list]

[h1] Expansions [/h1]
[list]
    [*]The expansions offer of more of the same game and are both [b] ""What if? [/b] scenarios, so they aren't canon to the later games, which may turn some people off. Despite this, they're still worth playing
    [*]Extraction Point was a highlight for me, considering what could have happened if the F.E.A.R team survived and the future of Pointman and Fettel
    [*]The subway level was a highlight for me, changing up the game's scenery
    [*]Expansions add more weapons for you to use, such as the minigun and laser rifle to name a few
    [*]I did not like Perseus Mandate because I played them one after the other and started experiencing fatigue. If you're playing the entire series like I am, you're more than welcome to skip and go straight to 2 as there isn't anything significant. But for more gameplay and scares, you should play it. It's not bad by any means, just didn't enjoy and care for it as much

F.E.A.R is an excellent game and stands the test of time as one of the best FPS games I've played. Timeless."

76561199254349192,1714450623,True,"Alma Best Girl, truly a feminist icon. She got turned into an experiment and in retaliation caused immeasurable mayhem. Being honest tho the F.E.A.R Saga has been my favorite collection of games since forever, It's crazy that even 20 years later this game is still so good and holds up to the test of time so well. Waiting for a remaster one day (one can only wish). If you haven't done so yet, do yourself a favor and buy the collection, you will not regret it! 

Love for this game

76561197971777277,1713633979,True,"F.E.A.R. is a highly regarded FPS game, especially for its fun slow-motion combat and great AI. That's where I agree with fans, but it's also from the gray-and-brown era of games where everything looked as depressing as a padded cell covered in shit. If you work 9-5 in an office building then I highly recommend staying as far away from F.E.A.R. as possible. I enjoyed my second playthrough, but you'll be enjoying this slo-mo gameplay in a variety of facilities, dilapidated buildings, buildings under construction, office buildings, parking lots, a wastewater treatment plant, etc. I'm not talking about graphics here, but choice of setting and that compared to other similar games like Max Payne or even Doom 3. While Far Cry or Crysis were set in the actual jungle then F.E.A.R. is its concrete equivalent, both in repetitive level design and lack of variety in locations. I don't know which city Fairport is based on, but I'm glad I don't live there. 

In terms of light and shadows used in a horror game, Doom 3 BFG Edition has it beat by a country mile, even though both games look equally gray and repetitive. F.E.A.R. also features the worst flashlight I've seen in any game, ever. You're supposedly playing a rookie in an elite United States Army unit F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) and its standard gear includes the world's shittiest flashlight. Does Alma and Fettel have the supernatural power to drain my flashlight battery, is that what I have to believe in order to enjoy a game that's set in 2025? Yes, I've pointed out other times that flashlights do run out of battery and that the player should get over it, but this is the most useless flashlight featured in any game, period. The Imalent MS32 has a lumen output of 200,000 and its longest battery runtime is 345 hours. Neither game is scary in 2024 though, no matter how dark you make these horror games. If I want to actually scare myself these days I only have to read the news. I don't fault the game for its story, but it's not strong enough to overcome the dark, mundane levels where it's played out.

Another thing that doesn't improve on repeat playthroughs is the embarrassing lack of support for old games in general, even though Monolith Productions is still around and Warner Bros. Games has hundreds of millions to sink into such surefire hits as Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. You deserve games that flop if this is how you treat your back catalog. The fact that the fans have to make guides for would-be customers, who've no idea what they're getting themselves into, to be able to run the game on Win 10 or Win 11 on Steam, the only Windows OSs currently supported on Steam since January 1st 2024, then everyone involved, including Valve, are scammers for selling these games in their current state. You have no excuse for this. Respect what you've created, warts and all, cos this is worth preserving no matter how jaded gamers like myself feel about it. F.E.A.R. is worth playing, but with each old game I play on a modern system, few are worth the extra work I have to put in in order to play these beloved titles. Get your shit together, Warner, this is literally your job. To be a gamer is to give You money and then waste time on wiki pages, config files, unofficial patches and/or mods just to be able to run a game in 2024, in the age of drone warfare, self-driving cars and robots that do backflips."
76561198189651015,1713632629,True,"This game is a building block on horror and shooters, such a fun time, great story and for the time the gore and AI was insanely impressive. I love all three games and always seem impressed while playing.

Adding this after beating both DLC's I have to say I really had fun. I will say though that neither DLC is canon and you aren't going anywhere too different look wise. The first DLC Extraction point starts right after the events in the original campaign and being on the streets feels so cool in this game. I also found that the both DLC's had more horror to them at least to mean it felt that way.  While playing this you don't get too much new variety in game play, really just a weapon or two and a new enemy or two but for this non canon story it really fills in some nice context.  That being said for Extraction there is a super bad issue with it on pc, like you are going to be fighting the game half the time. I had to spend an hour probably in total just being forced to stop mid game and fix it to continue. It is an older game so if you do have an issue there is no doubt a fix but it just ruins the fun when your'e invested. 
For Perseus Mandate I think I actually enjoyed it a bit more then Extraction point. like the last DLC you get two new weapons and like two new enemy's, but this none canon story I really frickin liked lmao. I found myself more of a fan of the two NPC's in this story compared to the base story. There's also a cool feature of having NPC's fighting with you in this somewhat bigger arenas. I also enjoyed although confused why he was picking on this soldier you play as but Paxton is here and giving way more context and confirmation on what events took place in the base story. Last thing to add for this DLC is its like almost 6 hours in length without the bonus missions, almost the length of the base game itself and Extraction point I beat in under 5 hours. This game and the two DLC's are a lot of single player fun, and there's a lot of fan support for the multiplayer functions so you could probably figure a way to get those features working.  So worth grabbing this game, the DLC's and the two squeal games (3 is better than 2 imo)"

76561198344402020,1713528134,True,"This game is a true old school game that has some amazing mechanics , the bots are so smart!"
76561198386425378,1713512605,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of the best first person shooters of all time. Everything from the smooth, John Woo style gunfights to the disturbing horror atmosphere. Most of all of what this game does, it succeeds. It truly is one of the best shooters of all time. Let's start with what makes this game so good.

This is a game from 2005, so you'd expect it to be pretty dated when it comes to the visuals, and for the most part that's true. Where this game really shines is in its dynamic lighting system. Back then dynamic lighting was a big thing in games. If you wanted to show off how good your game looked, you would want dynamic lights. F.E.A.R. does dynamic lighting very well. It's amazing what a few well placed lights can change the feel and look of an otherwise boring and flat looking room. F.E.A.R. is filled with dynamic lights. You'd be hard-pressed to find a place in the game where you won't find any dynamic lights, apart from outside. Textures and models still hold up pretty well too, and overall the game still holds up all these years later.

We're not done with the visuals just yet. F.E.A.R. also makes extensive use of the particle effects that the LithTech engine has to offer. Particle effects in this game are insane. Every gunfight will leave smoke hanging in the air, stacks of paper will explode into dozens of shreds, grenades will create a window shattering shockwave effect whenever they explode. Comparing the gunfights in F.E.A.R. to that of John Woo's 'Hard Boiled', we can really see where they got their inspiration.

Now let's talk about F.E.A.R.'s excellent gameplay. People have been claiming for years that F.E.A.R.'s artificial intelligence is the best of all time, and well. It's not. To be fair, F.E.A.R.'s AI is very good and it goes hand in hand in how the levels are designed. F.E.A.R. will teach the player very early on that enemies are never alone. Replicas are always in a squad, and they like using teamwork. I said before that F.E.A.R.'s enemy AI works very well with how the level is designed, and that statement is mostly true. Enemies will do everything in their power to slow you down, so they'll use the level to their advantage. They'll try to flank you, they'll throw grenades to flush you out, hell, they'll even flip tables over to make cover for themselves. Not just tables but vending machines, shelves and furniture. They'll dive through windows. Replicas can do a whole lot In F.E.A.R, but what can you do?

Well, they give you an arsenal to fight these guys, and badass slow motion. There are thirteen different types of weapons in F.E.A.R. ranging from your standard pistols and rifles, to grenades, mines and remote bombs and even experimental military weapons. All the weapons will get the job done, but unfortunately you won't be seeing many of them until the ending chapters of the game. Out of all the weapons, the shotgun is the one that really does it for me. The serotonin rush of seeing a replica turned into a red mist from a single blast of this god tier shotgun is awesome. You're not just limited to guns though, no. You also know Kung Fu. There are a whole bunch of melee attacks and they're all based on movement, so jumping will do a kick attack and crouching will do a leg sweep. Even though I didn't end up using the melee very much, It's still very enjoyable to kick a replica in the face and see him flying across the room.

Let's talk about the Horror aspect. It's not as good as you would expect. Concerning the visuals, F.E.A.R. does some pretty cool stuff when it comes to the horror, like falling out a ceiling that's covered in a pool of blood which you have to swim through. F.E.A.R. sets you up with a bunch of long hallways to build tension, sometimes not even having a payoff. But when it does it goes all out. Sometimes the horror segments just seem a little too exaggerated. I won't give any examples because of spoilers but if you've played the game you should know what I'm talking about.

As much as I love this game it doesn't come without some issues. Mostly to do with the pacing of some fights and repetition. Every area you're in just feels like you're there for a little too long. Because of how the AI works you're almost always going to be indoors, and this can get a little boring. The gunfights remain interesting but you'll spend most of your time walking around what seems to be a copy and pasted municipal building, with the only break you get being a horror segment. Even with good gunfights they sometimes end up feeling the same.

In conclusion, F.E.A.R. sets itself up as one of the best horror shooters of all time. Gameplay is interesting and engaging. The horror segments, if a little overblown at times, help to break up the otherwise stale moments of walking through an office building. Definitely pick this one up, but only when it's on special since you can't buy the original game anymore, you've gotta get it in a bundle with all the other games. If you don't want to do that GOG sells it for like ten bucks. Do yourself a favor, buy F.E.A.R."

76561198322583189,1713415421,True,This game has great horror atmosphere and some creepy moments that makes it enjoyable. It also has some fun game mechanics such as slow motion. One of the best horror fps games ever made in my opinion.
76561198445143666,1713392501,True,"Fear is an FPS mixed with themes of horror as well as some John Woo levels of shootouts and bullet time. Well, this game rocks!

Guns: Obviously the most important part of an FPS is the guns and how they interact with the sandbox. Every gun feels great, with viable options for any sort of encounter that'll be thrown your way. Obviously some are better (If the shotgun ever leaves your inventory you are playing this game wrong) with possibly the most powerful hard hitting shotgun I've used in quite some time, rivaling doom and blood for one of the most powerful and useful shotguns to ever be created. Duel wielding is also very welcome, you can't get any better than dropping into a room with 5 guys, hitting slow-mo, and blowing them all away with 2 pistols. Of course you have your standard assault rifles, smg, yada yada but then you pick up a laser sniper that turns people into skeletons and realize everything's about to be very swell. Most enemies will take a couple shots and falter, with some tanky varieties in robots and heavy armored soldiers, but they are easily dealt with when your mixing shotgun shells and hand grenades. Prepare for bombastic shootouts

A.I.: Often overlooked, every enemy is willing and capable of taking you down. If you want a specific example right off the bat, If an enemy is left alone, knowing you've gunned down all their friends they will not charge you like an idiot, but run away and hide. They'll try and trap you in rooms, hide away for sneak attacks, or hold their ground at vantage points cutting key lanes off. Though I don't think they properly work as a team dynamic, they absolutely work on the individual levels and will crush you if unprepared so be on your toes and never underestimate any opponent. You also have the more supernatural opponents but thankfully the ghosts in this world seem to respect buckshot so put em down with some hot burning lead. 

Sandbox: Besides rolling with a cranked gun load out, you also can pick up utility items like grenades, mini turrets, and landmines that can turn the tide of battle when things get extremely over whelming. Turrets should be saved whenever possible as they are extremely useful for not only distracting enemies but also keeping consistent fire upon any targets in sight. If you ever find yourself on the back foot throw a turret on the ceiling and it'll give you the time you need. However, don't expect enemies to rush you without a plan. They'll often avoid landmines or not approach you, knowing they have the advantage so planning on hiding will not work. Face them with horrendous aggression and a wall of lead. You may be punished for running into open rooms with no plan, but that van carrying a bunch of guys that parked 5 feet away? Rush em with the shotgun and turn on bullet time, you are cranked after all so why cosplay Neo? The screaming and gore will fade quickly

World: Simple enough, you go through normal day locations that have been over run by hoards of super soldiers so expect heavy resistance everywhere. Shooting lanes are vast, rooms are open but full of cover and firing positions, and they generally suit the game play extremely well. Very linear but every engagements solid so you won't be dissapointed.

Story: As always no spoilers, let's just say a decent thriller that builds up to an explosive finale. The DLC's will end the same way as the stories run together so don't expect different outcomes. 

Horror: Often you'll be alone traversing dark abandoned areas being stalked by super natural beings the whole way so your never truly alone. The flashlight does not last forever so don't be caught in the dark without it if you want the horror elements to not be as scary. Overall the scares are surface level and never made me recoil but definitely built enough tension for me to be worried about what was in the darkness so more of a thriller than horror but it works well. Thankfully supernatural beings seem to be effected by bullets so make em suffer

Now this games older so I'll give it a break for looking like It's from 2005 because it is from 2005, but the older and less polished graphics lead to better horror elements in my eyes so I'll take it. 

DLC's: No spoilers as before but they're solid overall. One's set engagements that last about 4-8 minutes but they add new shooting galleries that you can try to get the best time on (Kind of like time trials but how fast can you shoot through everyone and make it to the end). The other's play longer, maybe about 2 hours each but add onto the world around you as you play through other parts of the city both before and during the outbreak. Obviously the ending will be the same as the original game with them all running together but more awesome shootouts and more time with duel pistols sounds great to me! 

Cons: There aren't many, really just being graphical related as the games so old an the multiplayer really is dead. However there is one part involving water and a ledge you don't think you can reach, BUT ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN IF YOU CROUCH JUMP WHILE HOLDING UP AND FORWARD WHILE SWIMMING IN THE WATER. It was the only time I got stuck and couldn't figure out what was wrong until I looked into the full control menu, If your stuck in a water section with barrels floating in the water don't use the barrels to help you, open the control menu and you'll find out this is the only time you'll really have to use crouch jumping while swimming. So weird as there's no other section in the game or dlc's like this. 

Before we end this, I'm just gonna glaze the tip of the shotgun for just one moment. It's possibly the best shotgun in gaming. The VK-12 shotgun as it's called in game, is capable of taking down all but the extreme heavy robots with just the rounds packed into the chamber, holding a hefty 12 rounds that deals with 12 problems in a row if you hit your shots or taking fully armored enemies down without the need to reload. If your carrying this beast in your hands you know anyone before you is quivering in their boots fearful that some cranked out mute's gonna come around the corner and unleash 12 hot flaming walls of lead easily capable of cleaning entire rooms in just a few seconds. It also sends the rag dolls flying so make em fly whenever possible. Any other weapon is of course capable of dealing with enemies but the VK-12 won't just kill them, It'll put real F.E.A.R. into their hearts. DOOM guy would be seen with this shotgun if he could get his hands on it 

Norman bates: A complete asshole, don't forget it. Very murder-able NPC, I love It 

If anyone took the right things away from valve/Half life (Linear shooters that use good story elements and solid game play/memorable moments in every chapter leading up to an insane ending that leaves the player wanting more) it's here. I've played a lot of garbage FPS games throughout the years and F.E.A.R. doesn't disappoint. Best FPS I've played in quite some time, being a little shorter than I remember with only one bad section that may confuse the player, this game rocks. I immensely recommend anyone who loves FPS game to play. If you really want a score 9/10. Extremely solid experience with one really minor but bad water section. ""Max Payne and F.E.A.R. hold the award for best bullet time put into an FPS"""
76561197967787868,1713355684,True,"The action, suspense and horror is really great on this game. Even besides is an old game the gameplay is really enjoyable."
76561198307774273,1713313440,True,"F.E.A.R. is an interesting game for me. I am someone who mostly plays platformers, and a few racing games. FPSs, and shooters in general have never really been my forte. However, I have quite a few friends who really dig this kind of game, and I gave this one a try on behalf of one of them. After playing it from start to finish, I've got a few thoughts on the game.

The game as a whole, is pretty fun, if a bit slow going at points. I would certainly call it good, however, there are a select few areas that keep me from calling it great. First off, the enemies. A positive that most of the enemies do in this game is the call-outs they make to each other. they make them all feel much smarter than they may actually be, and much more alive as well.  Unfortunately, toward the end of the game, these callouts begin to get old given that this game has a serious problem with enemy variety. 90% of the enemies in this game are either the copy paste clone soldiers, or the copy paste armacham guys. aside from the occasional assassin guy, big armor guy, mech, and drone, that's pretty much all you'll be fighting the whole game. 

The level design is decent for the most part. it's got a good collection of arena's naturally built into the levels that do a good job prioritizing different weapon types. On that topic, the weapons are also pretty fun to use.

The story though, is sadly pretty uninteresting. the presentation is boring and dated. the setup is good, but the payoff is lackluster, and the twists here and there really don't hit. but, the game is mostly gameplay focused anyway, so that isn't too big of an issue.

As a whole, good game, could be better, but I'm glad I played something like it. I'd give it a 68/100"
76561198064705993,1713306894,True,"Well I finished it, finally! 

I thought it was a cool story, but there were sections that REALLY felt long and repetitive, there some variety at the end but I just didnt enjoy my self, the shooting was okay and the slow mo ability great but what I really loved was the surreal nature of the premise it was really fascinating.

I think the atmosphere contributes more to the horror aspect than the scares do, the atmospheres really good. The building layouts are depressing but feel lived in.

I bought the first F.E.A.R. game and its expansions (F.E.A.R.: Ultimate Shooter) off G.2.A. for $1. Don't pay $50 bucks for this, its almost 20 years old."

The F.E.A.R. franchise started off incredibly strong with it's first entry. Unfortunately the sequels would never come close to the quality of the original. Despite the games age, F.E.A.R. largely holds up against the test of time and still remains an essential FPS title to this day.

[h3][The Positives][/h3]
-Great gameplay.
-Solid difficulty.
-Good atmosphere and decent horror.
-Decent story.
-Good music and audio design.
-Great destruction and particle physics.
-Incredible level design and AI makes this game very replayable and dynamic. This games AI holds up better than modern games.

[h3][The Negatives][/h3]
-Some of the visuals get repetitive after awhile.
-Sometimes the horror is a bit cheesy and cliché.
-Clunky animations and somewhat outdated graphics.
-Requires you to buy the overpriced FEAR Complete Pack. You can buy this game standalone on GOG.
-The game may require some tweaks to get running properly. Check the PCGamingWiki if you run into issues.

F.E.A.R. is one of the greatest horror FPS games ever made. It's solid gameplay and incredible AI makes it a timeless classic. Definitely a must play title.

76561198049609528,1713085175,True,"F.E.A.R. is an absolute classic, that still holds up well in 2024!

Brilliant gameplay, satisfying bullet time mechanics and tough enemy AI - really set this game apart.

There are a host of great weapons and levels, with an engaging horror / sci-fi plot that easily sustains its 10 hour campaign too. With modern experiences like Trepang 2 and Out of Action heavily influenced by F.E.A.R. and its sequels, there's no doubt that the original has cemented its place in FPS gaming folklore.

For fans of unique shooters, challenging opponents and the odd scare, F.E.A.R. gets about everything right."

76561198009641717,1712988508,False,"A timeless classic of FPS gameplay. Highly recommend it if you want an enjoyable story, enemy AI that feels dynamic and intelligent (mostly through intelligent level design), and good combat in a tight package.

With that being said - it has been removed from sale on Steam unless you buy a $55 package, and the sequels range from ""mediocre"" to ""absolute garbage."" If you get it from an old code elsewhere or such, I hope you have fun, but I would never buy the bundle to get access to this nearly 20 year old title."

It is still a marvel to play to this day with its harsh combat encounters and oppressive atmosphere. While the main dialogue and plot isn't anything to write home about, the way the game handles its world building and the use of The Pointman's unbroken perspective could put it on par with classics such as Half-Life of Call of Juarez. 

The thing this game is remembered for the most is it's combat encounters and impressive AI which still hold up now. It has been known that most of the AI's actions are just little dialogue tricks, but I found some of the stuff that the clones pulled off on me crazy. They will blow up explosives, cook grenades, fire behind themselves when running, all these little cool things. All while the area is pelted with frags and covered in clouds of dust John Woo style. 

This game is a true classic, but the worst thing about loving this game is knowing that none of the other games in the series live up to this standard lol."

Even today, the enemy AI for this game should still be praised, they have environmental interactions, ally interactions, and will respond to what the player is doing. Truly impressive for the time.

The horror elements were an excellent choice to provide drive and reason to what the player is doing, though admittedly none of it was truly scary... more disturbing and uneasy. The sound design and framing for these elements however were spot on. 99% of the time the game ensures you see something it wants you to see naturally via lighting, narrow viewpoints, etc. all without ripping control away from the player. Even the gunfire was sublime and satisfying as you hear the casings drop to the ground.

Eu sempre olhei com preconceito a franquia que me parecia bem ruim afinal foi uma geração que éramos jogados vários FPS( só nessa época tivemos Bioshock, resistence, Killzone...) e esse era um dos que menos me chamasse atenção. Depois de quase 20 anos em uma promoção eu achei o a franquia por uma promoção incrível e pensei, pq não pegar e ver se era isso tudo msm? E aqui estamos.

O primeiro jogo. Sinceramente achei ele bem ok, não vi o terror que sempre prometeram e a ação é uma cópia de half life so que com uma gameplay mais sem graça. Graficamente eu achei ele feio, até para 2005 porém as sombras e o escuro no jogo são muito legais, os cenários também são péssimos e confusos. Por ser um jogo curto não me incomodou jogar, não é o péssimo jogo que eu imaginava mas também não vi nada de incrível neste jogo.

i have absolutely no idea what the plot was. something something science experiments something something girl from the ring. the ending was abrupt, to say the least, and didn't really give any resolution to the story. however, what plot was there wasn't bad, and what little i managed to remember in the sea of names on the voice logs did enhance the atmosphere. plus i do like lurking around searching for phone logs. the atmosphere in this game is great, and pretty damn scary, keeps you on your toes the whole time.

the scene where the fat man crawls into the ceiling is very funny.

alas you can only buy it in a bundle of a bunch of other games, and to actually play the game at a framerate above three per second, you have to install an ancient DLL patch, but if you're willing to put up with that and you can find the bundle on a large sale, v v good and i would recommend playing it.

I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Although that was my experience, maybe you are someone who played it back then and even enjoyed the multiplayer as well. I'd say its well worth the revisit or playing it fresh as I just did. It was an enjoyable game and I will be playing the rest of the series. The game did have a few bugs that I personally had to fix to actually play the game.

 1.) For some reason I was getting low FPS (20FPS) because I was using a Logitech mouse. This was fixed by following a guide from a Steam community member (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=759431266).

76561198013541173,1710767830,True,"At the time of release, the game was just a bomb, I had not seen or felt this before. The genre is listed as horror and everyone is mistakenly looking for it at once, so where is there to be afraid or tremble with fear? To be precise, it seems to me a fusion of an action movie and a mystical thriller with intersperses of science fiction, strange visions, voices, a walkie-talkie constantly notifies something unidentified, clearly ghosts are naughty, gloomy and cold corridors, sounds and creaks from every alley, or maybe it's all a figment of the imagination and just imagining it? The developers themselves have set themselves an ambitious and even practically impossible task to create something completely non-standard and unlike anything that has been done before. Combine an incompatible action movie, action, with a chill of mysticism and dream a little on a free topic, what if you do it like this... I think that they quite succeeded, that there is something individual, original, inimitable and original in this game.


It's just not possible to break away from the gameplay for a second. The cold and mesmerizing atmosphere and of course the music written by a genius, the genre here can be described as ambient and seems to feel every cell and nerve literally from every millimeter of the game, conveys the character and mood to the player. You just plunge into this mystical and cold pool of the Fear game world.
You can talk for a long time about ideas and inspiration and what contributed to the creation of the game, but I want to touch a little superficially on the plot and the enemies and characters themselves.
The plot is very unusual for me for such a game and at first you don't even expect what awaits you ahead and what role the point man will play, the enemies behave very organized and constantly keep in touch with each other, telling how best to lead in a certain situation, this is one of the main components of the game, artificial intelligence, it is very thoughtful and made with a special approach.
Not a small choice of weapons, I wanted to carry 4 types at once, but there is a limitation in the form of 3 units, I like all types, they are interesting in their own way, especially the laser prototype and the explosive.
As well as physics, interaction with the environment, explosions, sparks, dust during shootouts, as well as a combat system, making tackles and hitting opponents from the foot.
The characters, their voice acting and much more, as well as a mysterious girl in a red dress, will try to intimidate us throughout the game, her appearance in the game is like a kind of warning or as a messenger of something bad. Immediately, where we see some kind of blood or skeletal remains of enemies, the characteristic handwriting of her anger is)
She could kill us 100 times, but she needs us for something, and for what exactly we will find out in the finale.
Coordinator Roadie Betters will be with us throughout the gameplay, this voice is encouraging and does not let you go crazy alone with these ghosts)
Even now, the game is on many people's minds, after so many years, I hope and would like to reissue the first game with updates, and if you can make a sequel.

76561198252415666,1710629042,True,A classic narrative driven FPS with a small dash of horror from the golden age of game development. 7/10

76561198095526552,1710161656,True,"F.E.A.R is one great example of a good mix of action with horror, and not in ways most action horror games and films do. Though the story is not at all that complicated or complex, it's simple but good. It keeps you interested to know where it will go, even if by itself, it's not the focus of the game. It's a very plot oriented narrative and very frenetic, filled with some good bits of action with some genuinely creepy and terrifying psychological horror moments, with effective jumpscares and horrifying imagery. 
Had a great time with F.E.A.R!"

The game play, graphics, gore, combat dialogue, and AI are amazing. The only thing I didn't really care for were that the levels are (imo) a bit bland looking and all looked kind of similar after a while, but aside from that, I really can't complain. If you are a fan of FPS games, then this is one you really should check out.

Game could use a remaster of some kind, patch up some small bugs, soft locks etc. And to make it easier to get a copy of, that remaster might serve well. As is, though, the age only shows in these technical issues. It's hard to find a game this dedicated to fun shooting and bullet time nowadays, so I'm glad to say F.E.A.R. stands tall among the most lauded shooters of the 21st century and holds its own against titles from even today."

[h3]Summary[/h3]
[b]F.E.A.R.[/b] was released in October 2005. Almost two full decades later in February 2024, it is still considered a golden standard in the FPS genre. Its gameplay still holds up now, so does its graphics to a lesser extent. The story in particular is stellar. If you haven't played this yet, now's the time to redeem yourself.

[quote][b]Disclaimer:[/b] I don't get compensated for any reviews I write. This is my honest opinion of the game.[/quote]

[h3]Stats[/h3]
[list]
     [*] Time played: 12+ hours 
     [*] Difficulty played on (Low, Moderate, ... , Extreme): High 
     [*] Achievements unlocked: N/A
[/list]

[h3]Gameplay[/h3]
[list]
     [*] F.E.A.R. is a story-rich FPS game with a touch of horror to it. 
It definitely has gore; lots and lots of that. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3162418454
The last time I played this was so long ago, I don't even recall when that was.

     [*] The key gameplay element is your supernatural ability to slow down time, which you use at your heart's content in every gun fight. This gives you the upper hand no matter what. It doesn't matter how many enemies are thrown at you at once, how well armed or armored or both they are, how tactical their attack is. You have SloMo. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3162210877

     [*] In typical classic 2005 fashion, the levels are designed so that you're 'forced' into exploring them to find your way forward. I consider this a plus.
 
     [*] Your character can carry three weapons at most at a time, making choices matter a bit more. With the variety of guns available, it might be a bit of delicious torture choosing which three to move forward with. 
 
     [*] The story and the different major characters in it are revealed to you via voice messages left on phones and intel extracted from laptops, both of which you find scattered throughout the levels. Surprisingly this works quite well.

     [*] There are two vital collectibles: Reflex and health boosters. They permanently increase your maximum SloMo and health points, respectively. Them being off the beaten track incentivizes you to explore more.  
[/list]

[h3]Graphics and audio[/h3]
[list]
     [*] The graphics are fine for their time but don't hold a candle to today's standards. That being said, they aren't a sore to the eyes either and have nothing funny about them whatsoever. They're just representative of that era. Ugh! Now I feel old.

     [*] The audio is impeccable. Really good with great voice acting from everyone involved. The sound effects, especially of guns, and the ambient music complement the eerie atmosphere and the action parts as well.  
[/list]

[h3]Pros[/h3]
[list]
     [*] Immersive atmosphere and fun, challenging gameplay. 

     [*] The effects while SloMo is active are some of the best in any game: the debris,  headshots creating misty pink poofs, and the semi-destructible environments.

     [*] Have fun
Your SloMo bar replenishes automatically. You're here to enjoy yourself, not grind for things. 

     [*]  [b] Realistic enemy tactics [/b] 
The enemy soldiers truly are terrific in F.E.A.R. They behave like a real-life unit should: Calling out what happens in the field, hide behind cover, seek you out and attack you aggressively, and -here's the best part- flank you from every possible angle available. It's as if you're playing competitively against a human, minus all the 'lovely' toxic stuff that goes hand in hand with PvP. 

It truly is fun to be tested like this and kept on your toes in a single player game, from two decades ago, no less. I played on the second-highest difficulty and got this experience. YMMV if you play on easier settings.

     [*]  [b] Realistic enemy chatter [/b] This is an example of the conversations I hear in FEAR. I heard this chatter between the two remaining soldiers after I decimated their team mates: 

Replica soldier #1 desperate: Squad, close in.
Replica soldier #2 nervous and angry: STFU

Need I say more! 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3162317154
     [*] [b] Brilliant level design [/b] 
Moving through the Armacham building felt as if I were there. Blocked spot? Find a way around it. No magical way that the path would just open up for you. 
F.E.A.R. does this but not too much that it gets bad. Did I get lost once or twice? Yes. Is that normal? I'd say yes, it is, because who memorizes their way through a new place while under extreme duress from only going through it once? Not me.

     [*] [b] No hand-holding [/b]
No mini map. No compass. No way waypoints. No hints, other than visual that are cleverly placed right where you need them.

     [*]  [b] Destructible environments [/b] Sort of? See, every bullet hits something , and that results in a visual and audible effect you see in F.E.A.R. Be it a flesh-and-blood enemy, a mechanical one, or even a wall or a lamp, you'll see it and it feels and looks spectacular.
Does that mean you can blow up a wall and take a shortcut? Nope. 

     [*]  [b] Best horror story ever told [/b] 
IMHO. 
Taking into account F.E.A.R. is a FPS makes it all the more impressive.
Things to note are the perfect pacing, the brilliant idea, and the way things are revealed. I'm not going to provide any further details here. It's best to enjoy it yourself. All I'll say is don't skip the flashing-red phones and the laptops. They matter.

     [*] [b]User-friendly save system[/b]
Auto-saves happen at the start of each level and at checkpoints. This is the norm. What's more is that you can manually save any time in the game. You may quick-save with F5 as well. This saved me a ton of time. 
  
     [*] No bugs or glitches in my 12-hour play time. 

It feels as if every conceivable aspect of the game had been carefully thought through beforehand and then worked on by a very talented team. [i]Why aren't FPS games made like this anymore?[/i] isn't a question but rather a gauntlet I throw at the gaming industry giants. 
Nope, I'm not talking to CoD devs; at this point they're beyond being saved by a line in a review, or an offhand roast in a game show, or the silent, disappointed stares from CoD MW 2007 and MW2 2009 players when CoD actually meant something, or, or, or!

[h3] Cons [/h3]
     [*] Sometimes you get lost. Not a biggie, rarely happens but when it does it's unexpected because this is a FPS after all, not a platformer or open-world RPG.
 
      [*] The supernatural / dream sequence parts. I didn't care much for those. Thankfully they were quite short and kept to the end of some levels.
[/list]

[h3]Achievements[/h3]
[list]
     [*] Total: Zero
     [*] 2005, when this game came out, was a time before developers and Steam slowly turned gamers into achievement junkies. Yes, I realize how hypocritical that is to say. You do see what most of us have become though, right?

Best time to buy is any time the F.E.A.R. package goes on sale. You get all three games (including all the DLCs) for a little over $8. https://store.steampowered.com/sub/12357/
Nope, I didn't get paid to do this. It's just incredible value for money.
Yes, of course I wish I did.

76561198016090414,1708168158,True,"It's incredible how well-aged this game is. I'm playing it for the first time ever, and it's hard to believe that this is a 20 year old game.

This game's AI is better than most games that come out today. Enemies can notice your flashlight and investigate, they can decide to push you or keep camping their position depending on the situation, they can scout and they can regroup, they can create dynamic cover by flipping over couches and tables, they can dive through glass panels and move seamlessly.

The level design is probably one of the best I've *ever* seen for a linear FPS. This game has such great environment and level design, that even the parts of the levels that are ""just a straight line"" feel like they are part of an actual sprawling office area with many paths. The overall audiovisual atmosphere is also top notch. Also the bullet impact effects, blood, glass flying around or how objects react when you shoot them are very well thought out and visualised. 

It does have its shortcomings though, as the weapon variety is quite abysmal. And so are their animations and models. Yes, even for 2005 standards. Enemy variety is also abysmal (Normal Dude, Armored Dude, Drone, Big Robot. That's all. All 4 enemies you'll face in the entirety of the game through 8 hours right there.) I still played it all the way until the end for the brilliant level design and amazing AI. Recommended."

76561197979687974,1708131566,True,"I put off this game for years, but the praise for the AI and gunplay is well deserved. Don't expect many horror elements, despite being advertised as horror it's no more creepy than hl2 (arguably HL2's zombie levels are more scary). If you want tight gun play with bullet time, this is great. I've only tried normal mode, but judging by the that, the harder difficulties will provide plenty challenge."

76561198271965289,1707366551,True,WHY IS IT SO FUCKIN LAGGY
76561198323059452,1707272280,True,"Pros:
*Best enemy AI I have ever seen in an FPS.
*Great range of difficulty from 'can play in my sleep' to 'almost impossible'.
*Leaning around corners.
*Great gun play.
*Linear, you can't get lost (if you like linear games).

Cons:
*Old game, so sub-optimal graphics.
*DLC's aren't great.
*Protagonist's strength detracts from the horror element.
*Linear, you go where the game wants you to, when the game wants you to (If you prefer open world games).

Personal opinion:
This is the greatest FPS I've ever played.  The enemy AI makes it incredibly immersive.  When you take cover, they will announce to each other specifically where you are eg. ""He's hiding behind the vending machine"".  They will act after those statements have been shouted in order to flank you, suppress you, or many other strategies to kill you.  They seem to become smarter when the difficulty is increased.  
I, personally, didn't find this game to be scary at all.  I do have a history of laughing at horror movies, but this is largely jump scare based.  I was terrified when I watched my father play it in Elementary School, but it hasn't been scary since.
The weapons all have their own niches that they work in.  I never found myself only sticking to one specific loadout, I would switch up what I was using depending on my environment and enemies.
I have at least 100 hours in this game because I have been playing it on disc for the past five years.  I haven't seen it lose any replay value, but I am autistic, so I don't mind doing the same thing over and over again.
To me, this is a 10/10 game that is absolutely worth buying.  If you are skeptical, the summer sale is a great time to get it for, like, $5."

76561198202943354,1706995445,True,"This game is so OK it kinda hurts. In 2024, not much about it is notable with some exceptions. The combat is fine, i understand why it's praised, it's deep for it's age, but it's really nothing special IMO, the enemies are just crazy generic, same as the levels and the soundtrack, which rarely feels like it exists at all.

But the atmosphere and the story can be interesting at points. The characters in the story however... what characters? There's Alma, some fu.cking annoying cartoon fat guy and that's it really, worth remembering anyway, amongst the other bland characters.

95% of my playtime was spent shooting super generic army dudes and a robot or two, so i don't know how many people would enjoy just doing that for 7+ hours with barely any deviation.

I can't blame the game for being old, i don't doubt that it was great back then, but now it's just... fine. To clarify, it's an objectively ""Good"" game that i just don't know how many people i could personally recommend it to."

76561198123467327,1706490478,True,Best game ever from the early 2000s
76561198251578274,1706443942,False,"Pretty disappointed to be honest, after years of praise and hearing how amazing this game was I was genuinely excited to play this but after my playthrough I can't say this is an experience I will look fondly towards to.

I will start from some nit picks and will build up towards my biggest complaints here.

-Weapon models that aren't copy paste of real world weapons are terrible, they feel like slapped together parts of real and fictional weapons and  in general were really ugly.
-I don't know why but in the middle of the game my fram erate would drop to single digits for no god damn reason.
-Whenever I closed the game and re open it my key binds would go back to their default state which was really annoying
-There is a severe lack of environments, for the most part of the game you either fight in warehouses or office buildings,
-The scenery in this game also looks like it is a generation behind even for it's time, the blocky buildings with really bad shading just outside of the window of the building I am in looks really weird.
-Guns have that shaky feeling that it makes it look like my character purposefully shaking it to simulate recoil   which makes automatic weapons really frustrating to use

Now onto my biggest complaint, the story and the characters, the story is told through one of my least favorite method of storytelling, logs. I wouldn't mind them as much if fear had actual characters that I could get some exposition from, but characters in fear are utterly one dimensional tropes that barely have any screen time, whenever I thought I would get some time to get to know the Asian chick and black guy whose name I forgot some shit happens and they have to stay behind. The story is also pretty generic, a standard super soldier experiment gone wrong type of beat with a scare that was super generic even for its time. Overall I can not say I enjoyed this game as much as I would like to and left me with a bad taste in  my mouth, hope the second game will be better."

76561198081969362,1706176913,True,"One of the best horror games for sure. It's got its on-the-nose moments for sure, but the environments, soundtrack and use of environmental storytelling, such as the laptops and answering machines found throughout the game, the pretty good gunplay, good range of weapons and disgustingly clever enemy AI make for a pretty engaging experience even without mentioning the horror elements. It's sad that we'll never get another truly incredibly F.E.A.R. game. Project Origin was a downgrade in almost every conceivable way, and F3AR, while being a deep, fantastically-fluid and well-paced shooter, just wasn't much of a F.E.A.R story and was a bit of a poor conclusion to Alma and her children's stories."

Bought it because i was in 2/3 in the game and never finished it.

F.E.A.R - Amazing AI to go against and ended up playing two separate difficulty playthroughs. You, being the Pointman have incredible reflexes that can make the game is easy because of the slow-mo features. Character can also peek around corners, something most fps doesn't have. The horror is really terrifying to me because the girl could just appear at anytime. Story's okay, they tie up mostly at the end. 9/10

Extraction Point - Game starts crashing during level loads because the system doesn't seem to be compatible. Had to put it down to Win7 compatibility and graphics to low/medium. Even more terrifying than the first one. They added more things from the base game and everything has mostly improved. More weapons, more enemy variety, more open enviromnent. 10/10

Perseus Mandate - Could see why some people wanted to skip this game. Same game crashing problems as E.P. You play as a different character, which for some reason has also the same reflexes(slow-mo) as the Pointman. Has the least amount of horror and its the hardest out of those 3 games. They tried to make difficulty harder based on those two games by adding on a new faction and different weapons, and those soldiers hit hard and are harder to kill. Their callouts also sounds emotionless. Sometimes the game can do some mixups to make some events memorable. They also have a boss, which i don't even recommend playing on the hardest difficulty. The ending sucks, when you compare it to how extraction point ended off because of how out of place it is. Their bonus missions are cool though. 6/10

This 2005 game was ahead of it's time."

It boggles my mind how a game from 2005 does it better, than most Triple A games coming out now. Combat is very fun, particles n shit flying all over the screen, enemy AI is superb and to top it off guns and equipment sound powerful and beefy. 
Although to play this game nowadays, you'll need widescreen fix, and for people with motion sickness like me FOV fix is really needed. But the fixes are easily accesible, and combat the rest of the game still holds up pretty well. 
Would definitely recommend to play it, when it goes on sale."
76561198005599258,1705498549,True,"This is one of those few games I'll keep coming back to every now and then. 

What you have here, is a supernatural first person tactical shooter that was well ahead of its time back in 2005, and still holds up today (if barely). 

On the surface, its environments look very formulaic. You have dry docks, corporate offices, urban ghettos, and underground labs. You've seen it a million times before, and you'll see it a million times again. The supernatural elements in the plot are an interesting take, and while the jumpscares might have rattled one back in its heyday, but their effect is one n done after a first playthrough, and compared to what we have today, aren't even that scary. 

The real meat in the game can be found in the AI. Outside of a few scripted movements, the AI is allowed to roam free when it comes to dealing with you. Enemies will actively flank, cover each other, press hard on a clear advantage, or even fall back on unfavourable odds. No other AI since has been as noticeably sharp, and if it has, its been overshadowed by gameplay mechanics meant to circumvent it. 

It's a 2005 game, so one has to deal with some minor headaches to get it running on modern machines, although less so than its expansion packs. These days, you can only buy the game in a complete pack, including said expansions, plus its sequels. Of all the games in the bundle, its the OG that's remained the strongest entry, while its sequels improved on visuals, but regressed on practically everything else."

76561198275281641,1705462225,True,"[h1]To Make the Game Work[/h1]
FEAR and the expansions all require this patch to play smoothly on modern hardware.
https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/789-directinput-fps-fix/

The base game and Perseus Mandate can run without any problem with the patch. However, I still experienced issues with Extraction Point, including no 2560*1440 resolution (require manual modification to game file), the bug “disconnecting from server”, stutter and crashes. I got by just fine by relaunching the game, but there are multiple fixes online you can try if they bother you.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
FEAR is a horror and tactical shooter. Players are to investigate a gruesome paranormal incident as a military specialist who can enable bullet time with super reflexes. Players have this crucial edge otherwise are in plain field with enemies as both only take a few shots to go down.

As enemies powered by smart AIs constantly outnumber players, it is necessary to peek through corners and deal with enemies beforehand, where the claustrophobic environments play an important role - tight rooms, narrow corridors and obstacles can be your advantage as concealments and your disadvantage as hinders of sight, creating a thrilling, tight paced, lifelike tactical shooting experience. Of course, you can always make your life easier with bullet time, and the slow-motion effect combined with the powerful punch from shotgun is immensely satisfying.

[h1]Environement Design[/h1]
This game has quite an achievement with the environment. Not only does it help shape the gameplay, the art direction also gives the game a timeless look, with impressive environmental destruction for its time and some amazing light effects even for today.

More importantly, the environments are so good in building the atmosphere: the combination of claustrophobic environments, desolation and a greyish color tone generate a bleak and dreadful vibe; and the clever use of darkness and shadows with some old but gold tricks, such as ominous music and grotesque bodies, makes an unsettling ambiance. While the game may not be the most terrifying, it gives players a great taste of unnerving.

As great as it is, environmental design is not without its shortcomings. While the game uses a lot of tricks to successfully make levels not feel as linear as they are, environments are repetitive and lack variety. This reminds me of why Resident Evil always has distinct environments in different parts of the games, because looking at the same environment too long causes fatigue, especially for games like FEAR that primarily happens in small space,  it can be very depressing and exhausting. It is even worse playing the base game and Extraction Point back-to-back, where the environment is equally if not more closed up and depressing. Therefore, it is relieving and refreshing that Perseus Mandate has players in more open and bigger space throughout the game.

Another problem is that the spooky sequences heavily rely on players looking at the right place at the right time, otherwise they might completely miss it. Additionally, after a while, it becomes predictable as players start to see the pattern of shooting level then spooky level, where players never get hurt, subtracting lots of tension.

[h1]Story[/h1]
As far as the story goes, it depends on missable audio logs to supplement the details and the presentation is not as cinematic as modern games. With the subtitles too small for modern resolution monitors (fixable with a patch), the story requires some attention to follow, otherwise there is nothing particularly noteworthy. 

On a side note, the stories of Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate are considered non-canon. I am glad they are because I am not a fan of Extraction Point story and Perseus Mandate story can cause continuity issues with the base game.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Despite the flaws, FEAR is still a classic with exciting tactical gameplay. It got me hooked in the singleplayer tactical shooter genre and I would love to see the series's revival."
76561197993584148,1705457150,True,"This game was made in 2005, and it is so far ahead of its time that it is actually, on some level, more impressive than most games coming out today. The enemy AI is incredibly smart, and the horror elements are superbly effective at creating a dark, uneasy atmosphere. My only complaint is that it feels a little repetitive in its environments, and there is a shortage when it comes to variety of enemies and weapons. Overall though, a great experience just 4 hours into the campaign."

Definidamente não é ruim, porém o ponto que mais me pegou na hora de comprar, um fps de terror, na realidade não existe, o máximo que tive de uma experiencia de terror em 3 horas de gameplay foi um soldado ninja que aparece do nada do seu lado te metendo bala.

Tirando esses pontos negativos (os quais me fizeram dropar o jogo), a dificuldade é bem boa (joguei no mais difícil, não sei nos outros), a história parece bem interessante e a gameplay divertida, não que houvesse muitas maneiras de errar sendo um 1x1 dos de Half-Life.

76561198990911759,1705378402,True,"despite having aged, fear is still a good game with a decent story and gunplay. made in the 2000's, the game carries some of the hallmarks of those years in game making such as a lack of proper sprinting system, subpar weapon sounds, loading gateways in the middle of levels, flashlight that runs out of battery, and a couple of expansions. but these outdated identifiers do not hold the game back as the satisfying gunplay and clever level design can easily carry the player to the end. as for the story, what may have been a great one for its time may now be considered a common trope among horror tales. tales of creepy children and tortured souls are not new to the genre and especially the 2000's had a fair share of them to offer in all different media formats. what sets fear aside though is that the game mixes a fear genre that relies on suspense and psychological horror with a somewhat fast fps action and succeeds in pacing the game just well enough that its jump scares don't wear off and its action sequences don't take the player's mind off of the possibility of facing greater evil at any moment."

However, let me paint a little picture of the bad:

""Wait, didn't I just walk past here? It looks the same. Am I going in circles? Oh, I see. For some reason the next group of offices was behind a door in the [i]JANITORS CLOSET[/i].""

""Oh wait, I think there's a ladder under those pipes that you normally find underground, but for some reason are between the 32 and 33rd floors of this ******* office building.""

The combat gets so dry after a while. For me it was like pulling teeth near the end. If you have no qualms with this sort of thing, the tedium can be alleviated with a small group of cheats that can be toggled with the ""T"" key. A couple of the most useful:

[b]F.E.A.R.[/b] is an FPS horror game released in 2005, and it still holds up to this day; it's considered one of the best first-person shooters out there, thanks to the intense combat and intelligent enemy AI. That being said, not a lot of people talk about the other stuff like the story, soundtrack, visuals, etc, so are they as good as the gameplay?

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
✔️ The gameplay is great due to the reflex time and intelligent enemy AI.
✔️ Creates a fantastic horror atmosphere.
✔️ The visuals still hold up well for a 2005 game.
✔️ F.E.A.R. Extraction Point expansion is a great addition to the game.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]
❌ The story is serviceable.
❌ The soundtrack, aside from the main theme, is forgettable.
❌ Repetitive locations.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The story starts off with a little ghost girl named Alma Wade freeing a rogue operative named Paxton Fettel in a military facility (or military prison, not sure), and he possesses psychic abilities that can help him control super-soldier clones known as the Replica Force. Once the news breaks out, the First Encounter Assault Recon (aka F.E.A.R.) sends an elite group, including you, the Pointman, to investigate.

Okay, I'll just go straight to the point: the story isn't really good, but it's serviceable. You will experience cool hallucinations from both Paxton and Alma, as well as occasional jumpscares (which aren't really scary). Having said that, I personally didn't find the base game that frightening, and most likely you won't either, but the horror atmosphere is still great and the characters are memorable.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
One of the things that is known about this game is that you are equipped with 'fast reflexes/reaction time, allowing you to slow down the game's world and enemies. This ability helps you aim your shots and react faster. As you probably already know, the enemy AI is great, thanks to the good level design, combat dialogue/banter, and, of course, the developer behind it (Jeff Orkin). All of these factors combined make the combat intense, fun, and unpredictable; the enemies can communicate with each other mid-combat, flank you, change their plan of attack, and even fall back and hide behind cover if they feel overwhelmed. And that's what makes the game a timeless classic.

You can use medkits for healing, and you can stack up to 10 of them in your inventory. You can find boosters that upgrade either your health bar or extend the duration of your slow-mo ability. Answering machines serve as the game's audio logs, offering mostly explanations and additional lore. In terms of difficulty, the only impacted factor is the damage received; the enemy AI behavior and the number of enemies remain consistent, at least from my experience. The soundtrack, aside from the main theme maybe, is forgettable.

[h1]Visuals and Level Design[/h1]
Every level features multiple routes for flanking enemies or for enemies to flank you. You can also find secret jumpscares, hallucinations and boosters in hidden areas. However, most of it takes place in office spaces and sewers, which leads to a sense of repetition due to the limited variety of locations. The visuals still hold up for a 2005 game, but the color pallet is mostly gray, bluish gray and brown.

[h1]F.E.A.R. Extraction Point[/h1]
Now, let's get into the reason behind why I'm writing this review: F.E.A.R. Extraction Point, as this expansion is often overlooked in discussions about the game. Similar to The Witcher 3's Blood & Wine, Extraction Point is an outstanding expansion that enhances almost every aspect of the base game. It introduces two new weapons, improved AI behavior, a creepy new enemy type, more hallucinations and jumpscares, and, most importantly, more diverse locations. It's also worth mentioning that most of my memorable moments are from this expansion.

That being said, the story is somewhat of a mixed bag. It continues right after the conclusion of the first game and all hell breaks loose, with more creepy occurrences and hallucinations that are just so cool. However, the main issue lies in the lack of explanation. You'll find yourself asking more questions like 'Why did this take place?', 'Why am I experiencing these specific hallucinations?', 'Will this lead up to something later?' and 'Why did they do that?', creating a confusing story overall (cool moments, but still confusing). Additionally, both expansions are not considered canon according to Monolith, which is disappointing.

[h1]Technical Issues[/h1]
I didn't encounter any bugs or glitches, but the framerate wasn't great. I noticed multiple FPS dips, especially while playing Extraction Point expansion where it dropped to 12 FPS. Two solutions I discovered were extracting a file called dinput8.dll to the game's folder (see guides) and reducing the texture quality to medium.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
All in all, it took me about 9 hours to finish the base game, while the Extraction Point expansion took me an additional 4 hours. Despite the underwhelming story and level design, the gameplay still holds up well thanks to the excellent enemy AI and intense combat. The game often goes on sale as a bundle with F.E.A.R. 2 & 3 at a cheap price, so I recommend buying it during these sales.

76561198056390435,1704925313,True,This is the first video game to really scare me.  I always played it alone in the dark.  Alma haunted some of my dreams.
76561198071403977,1704913333,True,"F.E.A.R. holds up pretty well as a first person shooter, but the story kind of bogs the thing down a bit. If you're wondering if this game is worth playing today then I would say yes, but during the last fourth of the game the story makes the game anticlimactic and bogs the thing down a bit. 

As a first person shooter, it's one of the best ones I've played. The game is easy for the most part since you can slow down time, but the AI is fairly knowledgeable of different tactics and reacts based on how you play. If you have a flashlight out, for example, the squadron might see the flashlight and start firing at you. If they see you turn a corner to flank this they will announce this over their radio. 

I find it weird that you can hear everything the enemy is saying being announced with crystal clarity, but it makes the game more fun because if you listen carefully to their dialogue they will do things like announce if they are the only one left because they're calling for backup.

The weapons in this game are also fantastic. I really like the nailgun-style weapon that sends the enemies flying with ragdoll physics. There's this one overpowered weapon that essentially just slams into the enemies and bursts them into bloody chunks. There's a bit of variety with the combat, too. You have a couple stealth enemies, some larger armored enemies that are better destroyed with explosives, turrets and drones. 

As you play you pick up boosters to increase health and the time slowing ability. I really liked this because it gave a reason to explore the environments. The graphics and music for the most part hold up, but as I said the last quarter of the game gets a bit dull as the story takes over and ""Alma"", who is probably in the game because the movie series The Ring was popular at the time, starts becoming the central element. I would've liked it better if the game ended with a massive battle that required extensive firepower. There are no boss fights and once you beat the game there's not much incentive to replay it. With that said, it's still a lot of fun and worth playing if you like single player first person shooters and have never tried this one."
76561198845089021,1704866394,True,F.E.A.R is probably the only game that can violently turn people into skeletons and I'll find it unnecessarily hilarious.
76561197961315413,1704849292,True,"FEAR 1 is one of my favorite Horror FPS games. Still looks fairly well on modern systems. There is some settings you have to adjust to get it to play on Win 7 & Win 10. See - www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/F.E.A.R. 

This was one scary game when it released. Not so much now, but its fun as heck on some levels fighting the Soldiers with bullet time. The AI was pretty smart for their time as well, which is why this game was a staple.

Rating - 8/10

EDIT - So this games store page was updated so that the reviews cover the expansions as well so...

FEAR Extraction Point - Great add-on, exact same gameplay. However the Story is more of a What-if Dream Sequence for the Ending of FEAR and is not canon to the original game according to Monolith. 

Rating - 7.5/10

FEAR Perseus Mandate - Similar Gameplay, except you are one of the Clone Soldiers in this alternate POV of the events in the original campaign.

76561198117862021,1704839269,True,"Back in the day we had a magazine for PC games called PC mania that would hype up this game with all this fancy spooky artwork and promises of great gameplay. At the time I was doing my first Half Life playthrough and that was enough to shiver me timbers so given the spooky premise in this game I'd likely S.H.I.T myself playing this nearly 20 years ago. 

While looking a bit dated the game holds its atmosphere well and overall the gameplay is fun. May require tweaks to run on modern rigs (check community guides) but once done it'll work as intended. Sad it's only obtainable through a bundle but I presume on sale it'll be worth it."

Both the base game and the expansions have some compatibility issues with modern hardware and high framerates, too.

With that said, F.E.A.R.'s core gameplay loop largely overshadows these minor issues. Give the game a look if you want an interesting horror-themed FPS game, and are able and willing to look past some slightly monotonous level design and gameplay loops."

76561198095506754,1704408364,True,"One of the best FPS out there.

An absolute masterpiece in enemy AI programming and level design, and with a great horror paintjob to boot!

The only faults I give it are a product of its age:

· It needs some patching in modern systems if you want to have more control over the display options (it can't run at 1080p or more without a mod, for example)
· The game starts strong and stays that way for a large chunk, but feels rushed towards the end
· While the horror element is on point and it's prevalent all throughout, the action portions are (imho) a bit more underwhelming
· Most gunfights won't last that long; you don't really get a chance to use all of your gadgets and tactics unless you're replaying the game and already know the encounters you'll go through.
· Would've loved for a more paused approach where you had to plan how you'd outsmart your enemies beforehand, considering how their AI is legendary at this point; its so sophisticated that I can't think of any other game that has achieved a better one in well over a decade.

All in all an amazing game, even with its obvious flaws. Would wait until its on sale, especially since you can't buy it separately anymore and need to buy the whole pack (or look elsewhere other than Steam, ofc).

Its expansions are an entirely different deal, though:

· Extraction Point's pretty good if you're more into the horror stuff, but it also felt like it had worse pacing issues; at least the atmosphere is still great and some of the encounters were pretty challenging.
· Perseus Mandate goes the opposite way and focuses on action, but at the same time it's worse than the original somehow. It's definitely the most forgettable campaign, so I'd only recommend it if you're truly hungry for more."

Enemy AI - Amazing. Searching, flanking, call outs, land a grenade in your lap, they do it all.
Slow mo and leaning  - These are basically your 2 tools to not get shot full of holes 
Weapons - Explosives feel very good.  Guns feel pretty good, some more than others.
Difficulty levels - Many options from easy to insane

-
Configuration - You will almost certainly need config/fixes to run this on present day hardware/software
Speed - Sprinting is basically just walking and there is a lot of it.
Environment - Environment can feel a bit empty.
Choices - Game is pretty linear and there really aren't any choices aside from what guns to hold on to.
Overall - Biggest negative for me is that the game boils down to a few enemy encounters, spooky thing or two, followed by more enemy encounters, rinse and repeat.

Conclusion - I did enjoy this game, I likely will not play though it again but I do not regret my time spent.  If you can get it for a few bucks on sale I would say it is worth a try."

76561198186405474,1703601193,False,"I personally did not enjoy F.E.A.R, I found the game overall to be extremely dated, with the only redeeming feature being the alright story and a bit of the atmosphere. Although, the game does appear to be a favourite among a lot of people, and I'm sure in 2005 it would have been great, but for me personally I did not enjoy. I'm going to list a few of the issues that I had.

I will start by saying I was going into the game looking for a difficult challenge with some exceptional AI.

I will start with combat as I was really disappointed overall. A part of my issue was with the AI so I will talk about it in a different section as its a bit lengthy. The bullet time was cool but very strong, I decided to not really use it through most of the game until I just wanted to be finished, then I abused it through the last couple of chapters to move quicker as it made the game very easy. The enemies shots felt very disconnected between me taking damage and their visual bullets, but maybe I'm loosing my mind. Some weapons are much quieter than others, which at the start with my volume settings some of them were completely quiet (such as the sub machine gun or the rifle) especially compared to the pistol. Before increasing my volume settings there were times that I only noticed I was being shot from the visual bullets or taking damage. The player movement would slide on ramps (e.g., garage level section) and it was quite annoying.

I have separated out my section on AI as it is an area that a lot of people love, but my thoughts are that its okay. I see their intention with attempting to flank or outmanoeuvre my position or communicate with others, but the level design can be very linear making only one or two ways for them to file though to reach your position allowing you to easily pick them off even without any bullet time, especially if you pick your angles. For most of the game you can just hold an angle and then peek around. For larger sections which allow the AI room to breathe and attempt their manoeuvres if you shoot and then move, when you peek again they will be slightly delayed in their attack, and you can take out one or do some damage and then you repeat until the encounters over, or even just move to outflank them yourself. Maybe its my play style that doesn't mesh with the AI, but I'm very used to games where if you peek too far or if you peek so you see multiple enemies you will die. I think in terms of an AI that I was impressed with I would say Trepang2's AI is better or at least the level design allows for more AI freedom while restricting the players movement. If you are actually looking for a challenge I would recommend Trepang2.

The game overall was quite easy, even on the hardest difficulty. While I couldn't just run and gun everywhere, I could very comfortably hold my position take them out and then move on without much resistance. Enemies could very easily kill you, but it wasn't too difficult to take them out first. Managing health is also easy as you can replenish back to full health after each fight with ease with the numerous medkits around. I decided to only ever use a medkit when I picked up a new one to add some difficulty as you can carry around 10 on your person making fights a breeze if you allow yourself to use them when you get low. I would also recommend doing the same to increase the difficulty even slightly. 

I wasn't really immersed either in the game, which detracted quite a bit from my experience. All the levels just felt like labyrinths which made them not very believable as being an actual location, especially the office levels. A lot of the sections felt more like a unity office asset flip on a basic shooter level.

The game was also a little on the shorter side only taking 6.2hrs to complete looking at my playtime on steam. This included time wondering around the maps looking for voicemails, intractable laptops and the health/reflex boosters which at least for the health boosters I ended up grabbing the majority of as I reached 185hp or 17/22 boosters collected.

Not related to the game but it is quite unfortunate that the game is only available via a bundle as it meant that I needed to spend a little more than I would have liked, and now I own a number of other F.E.A.R games that I am unsure if I will play.

Overall it wasn't bad, its just not what I was looking for."
76561199096166865,1703596738,True,"very good game. Gun-play is great for its time, still feels great. The story is decent too."
76561197990359508,1703596193,True,It's a great game that holds up still today.
76561197995712663,1703537980,True,"I played this the summer after it came out, and it blew me away. It was the most frightening game I had played to date. In 2023, the jump scares aren't as jumpy, and the AI shows it's age, but for when this came out, it was a hit! 
If you want to play an old shooter, you can't go wrong with this one. Just don't forget about your right-click melee, and your ability to do bicycle kicks. They will serve you well on higher difficulties"
76561198332823713,1703532158,True,"Its one of those good games as in its a really neat demonstration of GOAP designed AI and dynamic lighting, you dont play this game for its story telling. Its a simple slasher movie for the early 2000s type of plot and theme so its really not that interesting and almost comical. But where it lacks in narrative depth it shines in combat engagements where you cant take the AI for granted. Not super difficult to beat but they do flank, turn furniture into cover, check on teammates, and so on to make it a very dynamic game, which is impressive that came it out in 2005. It just seams that games now a days dont have this kind of engagement in there games and push for better graphics and animations (nothing wrong with that, but you cant forget the gameplay). Even though I do recommend it, this game is for those that are interesting in seeing this kind of AI first hand as the game a whole is kinda shallow with no incentive to care about what your doing or why."
76561198114563111,1703493468,True,"One of the best FPS of all time I'd say. 

- Intelligent AI (almost as smart as real players)
- A slow motion ability for an extra dose of badass
- Blood, gore and dismemberment - yummy!
- Plenty of ways to kill enemies (melee) - sweep kick, jump kick, sliding kick, etc.
- Fun to use weapons
- Enemy variety (grunt, elites, heavy, ninja and tank, etc)
- Unique story and paranormal setting 
- Semi destructible environment (or at least you can tell that a battle took place) and lots of physics
- You can see your fucking feet!!! +10 for immersion

Now even though it started to drag because like most FPS you're just running forward
and shooting shit, I managed to play it all in one sitting because the gameplay is
just fun and satisfying. There's also the creepy, paranormal stuff and great atmosphere.

There was a few issues with performance but not much (even with the fix) and 
when I originally tried the game some years back, I don't think it ran at all. But I 
reinstalled and everything was fine - maybe the files were all there still. All I have
to go on is that it's something called 'DirectInputFpsFix'.

The game also comes with two DLCs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate
which is another 10 hours maybe (haven't played them yet). 

So yeah, definitely recommended but be prepared to do some fixing.

The gameplay is extremely repetitive and if it wasn't for the slow motion/bullet time effect, it wouldn't have anything original to offer (especially not with its basic, conventional story). And even though F.E.A.R. might try to sell itself as a horror game, keep in mind that it contains very few elements of horror; at least, not enough to satisfy the horror games aficionados. It is mostly about shooting the same enemies wearing different skins. But if you like old FPS games from early 2000, you still might want to give it a try."

76561197974943333,1703251443,True,"Long review incmking!!

The year is 2005. In a month;y issue of Game Informer I received a demo disc. On this disc was contained a demo for a game called F.E.A.R., a game I had never heard of. What followed was something that changed the way I looked at games.

The game felt like most FPS games did, but this felt just...better, than anything else I had yet played. Mind you this is a world where a game like Counter-Strike existed. There just wasn't anything like this at the time. Horror games had two speeds at the time, Resident Evil or Silent Hill, there wasn't much else for people this side of the world. This creepy, dread inducing, J-Horror style game was completely in a class of its own. The horror was simply on point, nothing else like it. The game could stand on its own for both the horror and gameplay. They were both that good. As I got older, me playing this didn't change. I have legit played this game once a year for the last 18 years. Every playthrough I pick up something new. It has over time consistently remained my favorite game of all time. 

The Good:
Everyone talks about how great the AI is in this game, and they are most certainly correct. The GOAP programming that developer Jeff Orkin is to this day second to none. The enemy will change it's behavior based on your actions. If you sit still, he will rush you. If you hide, he will flush you out with grenades. If you advance he will actually shout at his buddy to give him a heads up. They talk and listen to each other. They take cover, they provide their own cover when none is available. They prove to be capable and completent enemies, especially on the higher difficulties, where the enemy compentency does't feel more ramped up just for sake of difficulty but rather for upping the enemies level of tactical ability. You never have endless waves of enemies thrown at you either, it's all small squads of competent soldiers.
The story also feels very grounded and keeps me entertained enough even after my 15th playthrough. There's enough to grab onto, but also enough mystery that makes it very enjoyable. The main idea being the assassination of Paxton Fettel you have been assigned to carry out. This may be your main mission, but very early on you get the sense that there is a much larger story happening and only reveling it a piece at a time is awesome. The pacing is brilliant. 
The gameplay itself is phenomenal, and I've STILL yet to see better in an FPS to this day. All the guns are fired froem the hip. ADS doesn't really exist and this is what makes games fun. You get to be such a badass, but you have to earn it. The slo-mo is also the most weell done of any game I've seen do it. The John Woo style gunfights never get old, with bullets whizzing by, explosions literally taking chunks out of walls, enemies being ripped apart by bullets, and a large cloud of smoke letting you know something big just happened. Oof that shotgun too, best shotgun of any game. 

The Bad:
I can really only think of one thing to say here.  
While the horror is certainly some of the bets in a game I've ever seen it comes with a caveat. All the horror happens in-game. The events themselves are scripted, but in the most basic terms, if you aren't looking the correct direction you could miss things. This is why I say I notice new things in every playthrough. You can outright miss some of the scarier things in this game if you aren't paying attention. 

In the realm of games that have aged well, this stands at the top. The bundle is literally on sale for $8.24 don't miss out on it. I have a higher opinion of the sequels than most, but The original game and the Files expansions are some of the best the gaming industry has to offer. Don't sleep on this any longer if you haven't played it. One small thing, I'd recommend a controller for the experience, it just plays better, but ultimately up to you they're both fine."
76561198426704198,1703236730,False,fps going down even at lpowest resolution not playable
76561197995553060,1703232040,True,"Neutral leaning positive. Real playtime around 8-10 hours due to offline mode, more if you count having a physical copy 20 years ago or whatever. A must play if you enjoy tactical combat encounters that require you to think on your feet.

Monolith, the original game company that couldn't count to three. I miss Monolith, I miss the Lithtech engine and, more importantly, I miss No One Lives Forever. This game the from the 00s also supports high refresh monitors just fine btw. That means that the engine is more advanced than half of the framerate-tied garbage that's usually used today for some reason that I cannot get my head around.

FEAR is best played on an older system from the period for the ""real intended experience"" but give it a few tweaks and you'll be mostly fine. The game itself? Well it's fantastic with several asterisks, but the reason I didn't play it much when it was more current is because I was sad about there being no NOLF 3. I still remember the teaser jpeg for this game and how hyped the NOLF community was before it turned out to be another IP unrelated to NOLF. On the plus-side, the Lithtech idiosyncrasies and reused assets/sounds give me warm nostalgia. It's not scary despite trying way too hard to be, but my word, the combat. That combat. Peak 10/10 gunplay.

However, once that ""echo nostalgia"" (a term I just made up) has worn off, what about everything else besides the awesome combat? Well that's the thing, and this is why the NOLF community didn't really migrate to the new IP; there is no everything else. The story is threadbare, boring and predictable. Mechanically it's a total downgrade, with no cool gadgets, ammo types or much in the way of stealth. The weapons are fairly standard military stuff. The humour that Monolith was always known for is totally gone. The level design is frankly a step backwards owing to the need to accommodate the revolutionary AI on the then-upcoming consoles of the time, and admittedly it pushed a lot of then-mid-range PCs to their limits too.

A lot of FPS games are semi-seriously criticised as shooting galleries and FEAR is the closest FPS I've ever played that fits that descriptor. It's a bloody fun shooting gallery with AI that is out of this world even today, but there is almost nothing else here. In other words, Monolith tailored this game to a more mainstream console demographic than their much more inventive and imaginative previous titles.

Verdict: It's a very good AI tech demo from 2005."

76561198416760533,1701980155,True,"👻 F.E.A.R: Thriller Action!

Look, F.E.A.R. gave me an experience that really threw me off balance. The game felt like both a thrilling action game and a suspenseful horror movie. At first, it drew me in deeply with its atmosphere and story.

One of the game's greatest strengths is definitely its atmosphere. Tense music, dark corridors and unexpected moments. Sometimes I thought my heart would stop beating! The paranormal elements of the game, as well as the character Alma, really gave me goosebumps. However, sometimes the suspense can get a bit boring and you need a breather.

The action sequences and fiery shootouts are really impressive. The slow-moving time effects make engagements with enemies incredibly realistic and satisfying. However, as the game progressed, I felt that some of the similarities became repetitive. At some point, the combat with enemies became a bit monotonous.

The story was also a bit convoluted for me. It often felt like the game was skipping clues and sometimes it was hard to understand the motivations of the characters. I expected a deeper story and character development.

All in all, F.E.A.R. offers a truly heart-pounding experience. Its atmosphere and moments of suspense can draw you into the game. However, the repetitive action and somewhat convoluted story can sometimes weaken the experience.

⚡️ Tense Atmosphere: 4/5
🔫 Action and Conflict: 3/5
📜 Story and Characters: 2/5

76561198894170922,1701223896,True,"some of the best fps gameplay u can get. the story is a little lacking and it tries to be a horror game a lot, but doesn't really execute it very well. The environments also can get samey but the atmosphere is great. the thing that shines most is the enemy ai. its incredible, and is legendary in the shooter genre. the way the replicas interact with the environment and space around them and the way they communicate with each other. it really makes you feel like you're facing an actual threat. Id recommend playing it on the hardest difficulty to truly appreciate it. 

You do have to fiddle with the files, however. this game is old and doesn't get updated anymore, so it runs pretty badly on modern hardware without some external files. its pretty easy to fix tho and you can find plenty of youtube tutorials on how to do it. 
its multiplayer is also not supported anymore without losing mods. 

Overall I'd give it a solid 8/10 and would def recommend 

Id also recommend checking out condemned if you haven't tried it yet. the ai in that game is very similar to this game's ai. 

(btw this game has the sexiest shotgun in any game)"

76561198023176365,1701138764,True,"Pretty solid FPS. A few of the jump scares actually got me too. Nice creepy vibe and decent enough story, though you'll probably have the twist figured out way before the game gets around to telling you what's up."

76561198353593495,1701078453,False,Game is ok. Mostly hallways. I kept getting stuck cuz the doors were blocked and sometimes I found a way and sometimes I didnt. I think this game is impressive techinically when it came out. I did play 3 and know you can play as the main bad guy in this one. After awhile of cat and mouse of finding the right door I gave up on it. It doesnt help that everything the same color.

76561199442937604,1701053390,True,Very fun game. Never really played the fear games except for the third one. was on sale with all games including dlc so i figured why not.

76561198174456027,1700974208,False,"Soooo am I the only one that thinks this isn't a horror game at all, but rather just a cookie-cutter action shooter that recycles the same 2-4 enemy types at you?

Don't get me wrong, the AI and ragdolls were impressive for their time and the first couple jumpscares were fun, but once you look past that you're left with a game that wants you to trudge through multiple nearly-identical shooting sequences just to reach an anticlimactic and VERY predictable ending that was about as terrifying as Boo from Monsters Inc.

I dunno... maybe I'm missing the nostalgia factor for this one. I just didn't enjoy it, and my takeaway is that it doesn't deserve the hype its fanbase gives it."
76561198051857869,1700931045,True,I love it more than the 2nd and 3rd! So cool game! But the hard difficulty is just insane

76561198274896587,1700907581,True,"An older game for sure and shows a bit in the animations and dialogue, but the combat is great and the enemy ai is excellent. They talk in combat, letting you know that they know where you are and what you are doing but they also do things like seeking cover, making cover, and covering others as they move about. Very nice. 

The 'fear' factor is mostly a few jumpscares sprinkled throughout while primarily consisting of dread and disgust for what has happened to the little girl in your visions, as well as not knowing when you will have to fight an enemy.

Good game overall though for ~8 hours at night. Make sure to turn the gamma up though so you can see. I thought it was night at the start but it was actually day."

The explosive sounds and ferocious kick of the guns, mixed with all the environmental physics and particles flying everywhere, really makes for a visceral experience that sets it apart from the rest.  And the A.I. is still some of the best in the business.  That there's a good story, a great soundtrack, and plenty of spooky moments is just icing on the cake.  Top tier action horror."

It feels like you are the main character in an action movie. And the enemy AI adds to that, making the player stay on his toes. The AI is somehow lightyears better than the AI in most modern FPSs lmao. 

Story was mid, and the cutscenes were not amazing, but thats not what I came here for.

This game is all gameplay and no cinematics, and it shits on modern FPSs.

Hopefully FEAR 2 can keep/improve the gunplay!"
76561197971518238,1700692874,True,For a older game. Great fun
76561198122754563,1700660625,True,"Though my play time currently is very short, I actually played FEAR many many years ago, and back then it was one of my favourite games ever.  Bought it on sale now again for $5 and this game doesnt disappoint, even after so many years.  Sure, it is definitely an older game, but it holds up very well, even today.  I would recommend to install Reshade for FEAR, as that solves a lot of issues with modern systems, and the game looks a bit better as well.

76561198009909392,1700348310,True,"For various reasons I’ve largely been playing games from the early 2000s for way too long, with some exceptions on PS4 and PC. I’ve either been too lazy or not inspired to write a review before but F.E.A.R. really surprised me. I didn’t expect it to be as great as it is, especially for a shooter from 2005. I was surprised at how modern the game felt considering it came out nearly 20 years ago (as of 2023). There are some obvious hints to its age, for example, it took some tweaking to run at 1920x1080, the default control layout is a little odd and there is no aim down sights, rather a slight zoom in effect. Also, the torch runs out of power quickly (a throwback to Aliens vs Predator 2, another awesome Monolith game). Despite this, the fire fights are great fun. As many have mentioned, the enemies are tough, using various tactics such as throwing grenades to flush you out and approaching from multiple directions and using objects for cover e.g., knocking over tables. 
Although F.E.A.R. is linear and doesn’t allow for much variety in approach, due to the AI and variety of weapons (I loved the shotgun and particle weapon) I found changing tactics and using the right weapon for the right situation was often necessary to defeat enemies. And there is of course the bullet time, but I largely didn’t use it except against specific (fast moving) enemies, as the gunplay was just so satisfying without it. There are variety of weapons available, including SMGs, dual pistols, assault rifles and some more futuristic weapons along with grenades, mines and remote bombs, and all are very satisfying to use. 
I thought the horror elements in F.E.A.R. were used well, making for an unsettling atmosphere. There were also horror/dream-like sequences that reminded me of Max Payne (nothing wrong with that! ) only less frustrating….actually some of the levels (along with bullet time) gave me the feeling I was playing an FPS version of MP, just without the diving around. After almost twenty years the graphics have obviously aged but I thought they looked pretty damned good after all these years (the upside to being stuck in the past is you can run everything on max settings). What really surprised me was the environmental damage, with chunks of concrete missing from the ground and walls or clouds of dust after an explosion or spray of bullets hitting concrete. Taking out enemies also had varying results with enemies being contorted into all sorts of positions (the penetrator gun impaling them against walls!) or limbs being blown off or enemies turned into a red mist of blood and guts. The sound effects were great too, along with the soundtrack.
If F.E.A.R. goes on sale and you don’t mind playing older games, I absolutely recommend it. The expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate are more of the same, really just adding more weapons (the sentry gun is cool and using melee to open doors satisfying) but worth playing anyway. By the time I finished both I was ready for a change but it was great fun and if they ever do a remaster, I will definitely play it.

76561198053881214,1700162460,True,"This remains the best FPS game ever. There are many that tries to emulate this game, or parts of it, but none as good as FEAR. This game has the PERFECT blend of slower-paced tactical cat-and-mouse, and balls-to-the-wall action that is unique and exceptional to this day."
76561198037348756,1700118656,True,"F.E.A.R, for what it was, is still a solid FPS horror experience. It feels like a combination of Half-Life & J-horror films (mostly The Ring). Half-Life comparison is not too far-fetched; from sound bites/ cues and weapon to set pieces, medkits, etc. feels awfully familiar. The set-up is also similar. A silent protagonist goes to investigate and stop mysterious phenomenon in modern urban and high tech settings. The only difference is, of course, reliance to horror tropes throughout the game.

Many had been said about AIs and lighting in this title. Although not overly smart, enemies AI nicely projected their intention & awareness through sound barks, flanking, cover leaning, etc. It made the player more aware of the situation at hand and act accordingly. Careful & creative use of lighting also heightened the horror experience for most parts. The slo-mo mechanism straight from John Woo’s films also added exciting gameplay to the proceedings.

That being said, this edition of F.E.A.R on steam is not the definitive choice if you want to experience it on modern machines. Of course, it’s not readily available to purchase today and only bundled as a part of “F.E.A.R trilogy” on steam. It’s not easy to setup on windows 10/11 & the performance suffers greatly. You’re probably better look elsewhere to play this title."

(It's certainly worth it when it goes on sale for about 8 dollars, though, which is how I got it. Each game can also be bought separately on GOG) And you'll need this for a few small fixes like fps and crashes along with scaling issues at really high resolutions: https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/F.E.A.R.
There was also crashes around the mission ""The L"" and you can find various fixes for it but I just...kept loading the game back up and quick saving often in case it crashed again. Yeah it's good. Get it. (F.E.A.R. 1 and its dlcs at least) It's not scary at all though. It's more like an FPS with spooky elements. Which doesn't really bother me, everything else made up for it. It also doesn't even need the slow mo feature to be fun either. I rarely used slow mo. Update: After playing through fear 2 and...witnessing the first few minutes of fear 3, I can confirm this would not be worth the full 60 dollar price tag for the bundle, wait for a sale.

76561199390674613,1699744421,True,"Still one of the best single-player FPS experiences out there. Impressive graphics for it's time (this required a fairly beefy PC to play back when it was released), enemy AI that's better than most modern shooters, and super satisfying combat (intense shootouts, bullet-time, over-the-top ragdoll physics, arguably the best FPS shotgun ever, and the list goes on). The horror elements and jump scares are just the icing on the cake.

Unfortunately, this gem of a game doesn't really get the retrospective love it deserves - and feels somewhat forgotten as a result. The multiplayer servers were shut down long ago, and you will need several patches to get it running correctly on modern PCs (nothing too tricky though - just a few files from PCGamingWiki). Also, wait for this to go on sale, as this first entry (and the best one in the series) is only available via bundle purchase (it's that, or hunt down an old physical copy...).

With that said, if you're a fan of classic linear story-driven FPS campaigns ala Half-Life 1 & 2, you owe it to yourself to play this if you haven't. Monolith Productions' magnum opus, in my opinion."

I was seriously NOT expecting how much I'd love it. The balance between horror and action here is perfect. The gameplay has aged really well, the visuals are still really good for the time (ESPECIALLY the lighting and water effects. Lighting keeps this game's atmosphere intact), the music is top stuff and adds a lot as well to each section of the game, the story is pretty good and the length of the campaign is also perfect; it finishes right when it needs to. Only downsides I'd say is that, because it's an old game, you need to do some tinkering with the settings on both the game and your GPU to get it to run above 25 FPS. The texts around the game are also TINY (explanation bits, subtitles, etc.). You NEED to install a small fan patch for that (which is at least very easy to do). But other than those things, this game is still a blast and I loved every single moment of it.

If you're interested in horror games with some good FPS mechanics, give this one a go. Definitely my favorite horror game right now. Final score: 9,5/10"

FEAR is a game where you are on a mission to take down a rogue member of the military who appears to be brainwashed by some kind of supernaturalish-entity.  The game fits into the genre of action and horror, and nothing but that!  It's kind of like if Jackie Chan were in Scream!  Throughout the game you encounter an arsenal of 8 weapons the game as well as 'slo-mo' and 'jump kicking' to help you achieve your goals.  

Overall I'd give it a 7/10.  This games is nothing but action and horror, there's very little ""choose your own approach"" mechanics in this game, it's kind of all guns, grenades, slow-mo, and jump kicks. This game has amazingly smart AI even by today's standards, but it seems like they are made for nothing BUT action, this game does not give you much flexibility to use more ""stealthy approaches"" or anything but running and gunning, so you're always going to end up in some kind of shootout.  Despite the amazingly smart AI, it feels like enemy varieties are just reskins and you are realistically fighting a total of 3 different of enemys, and it doesn't display the variety that a game like Halo does with all their grunts, elites, hunters etc all exhibiting distinct behaviors.  I liked how this game had its ""half-life"" moments where half the objective is trying to find your way through the map by finding alternate routes or solving puzzles... it's no HL though!  I also thought it did a good job of being cinematic and atmospheric, it reminded me of a game like dead space. The lighting, physics, and effects in this game were phenomenal for the time, with the only thing lacking is polygons IMO.

Overall, it's like a Halo and HL1 mashup without being either."

I spent my Halloween of 2023 playing this, since I bought it for the occasion, and it was an awesome experience. It has an oppressive atmosphere, the scares are very good and effective without being predictable, and keeps you on your toes. You'll be leaning in every corner, fearing for what might exist beyond a dark corridor.

The whole fuss about this game's AI being better than in modern games is 100% true. The enemies have reactions and logical thinking that are close to how an actual human being thinks. For example, they can see light beams from your flashlight, they accurately give orders to each others and actively try to ""flush you out"" of cover by throwing grenades, they gang up on you without a place to run, and have self preservation. Truly, this game has some of the best gunfights in ALL of gaming, and it's from 2005.

This game can be truly horrifying. You are either on corporate office buildings or underground facilities that feel like liminal spaces, peeking on corners with a shotgun in total silence, except for a wall mounted telephone playing beeps and saying ominous messages like ""The number you tried to contact is temporarily unavailable"" followed by more unsettling old phone sounds. This game feels ALIVE, both with its atmosphere and artificial intelligence."

The effects in gunfights especially during slowmo does a lot to punch up very limited (but intelligent and fun to fight) enemy variety.

The enemy AI may not feel as fearsome with the reflex-mode on, but they're still a tough piece of work and challenging to fight against, more so because they actually ambush you and throw grenades while communicating with each other in a more ""real"" manner, my favorite part is how the weapons affect the enemy upon death, it's just so gratifying seeing them either get pinned to the wall, explode, get parts of their body torn off, or actually scream with fear and anger when they feel the detonation of a grenade, you just never know what's gonna happen next with those little guys.

The level design may feel repetitive at times, but the ambience they were trying to do was spot-on, i could see real people working in these places, kinda.

Graphics may be old, but they give a weird vibe as a gap between the Sixth (PS2 era equivalent models) and the Seventh (PS3 era lightning and physics effects) generation of consoles, like Killer 7, it's old yes, but it has spice to it, gives a refreshing experience to play in this day and age.

Overall, it is a solid game, and worth trying out for the experience, ambience, weapon effects and AI interactivity alone."

Hands down the best AI I've ever seen in a single player FPS that forces you to play smart and make very dangerous spur-of-the-moment decisions to overcome them, which becomes incredibly satisfying when combined with the game's distinct slo-mo feature and gore system, all with an excellently satisfying array of weapons to use (and my favorite set of dual pistols I've used in a game since Call of Juarez Gunslinger and Halo 3). While the horror mostly falls flat and the level pallet can be overly repetitive, I can't recommend experiencing the gunplay enough. 

Just please buy it at a discount. 50 bucks for these games is just outrageous."

What's with all these spooky kids? I know children are pretty frightening, but storytellers sure are keen over the years to rub this fact in. If you don't agree, then you're made of sterner stuff than me, or you haven't been exposed to enough of these stone-cold youngsters. In which case, let me introduce you to Alma.

At least the game is kind enough to give you an armoury's worth of guns, not that it'll help you against the ghostly minor. Luckily, you can take out your pent-up anxiety on the hordes of clone soldiers. Not to mention you have a slow-mo ability that's meant to highlight your character's insane reflexes. Then there's also the psychic commander who'll telepathically control the clones... Damn, I love this game.

76561198142523877,1698708730,True,"I want to start this review by saying that i haven't played FEAR until 2023, so I really can't say anything about my impressions back when the game was more popular because i simply didn't have any.
That being said, FEAR (a game that is 18 years old as of writing this review) has a few grudges and kinks as of today both in terms of hardware compatibility and as a video game itself (how it's written, how it plays -- i will elaborate on those points later), but these problems are not enough for me to not recommend the game for those who are considering to play it.
[hr][/hr]
[i]Gameplay[/i]: I've played FEAR on hard for my first time, and as such, treated it less like a casual shooter and more akin to an earlier Tom Clancy's game due to how enemies deal damage. Slower pace helps create tension for the horror element of the game. In that regard, the game holds up quite well. Enemy AI, weapon balance and selection, level design (as shooting arenas, at least) and integration between FPS and horror among other things deserve praise.
However, there are two main negative points i have: Slow-mo, in my opinion, doesn't work with a slow-paced shooter; and that horror elements didn't work on me that well, and it might actually be where the game's age starts to show.
About slow-motion - i only really used it to defeat turrets with firearms in later chapters, just so i wouldn't burn as much health against them. While I understand what they were cooking, it still feels out of place for a game that tries to keep a player on their edge with the tension of knowing that enemies (or horrors) are lurking around the corner. 
Speaking of horror, the game builds tension well despite its age, but in my opinion, it fails to reap the tension that was created prior due to the methods it employs. The game doesn't have [i]jumpscares[/i] as we know them now, other than flashing JPEGs in the players screen for a split second (i can count that happening three or four times for the 6 hours i've played), and it's other favorite: ""SomeoneWalkingThroughTheCorridorAndYouSeeItForTheSplitSecond™"". It works in survival horror or in games where you're unarmed, but in a shooter like FEAR, your first instinct usually is ""shoot it and see the reaction"", which doesn't pay off the tension in the situation you're put in (or i am that much of an [i]EPIC[/i] gamer).
Despite the flaws the game has, it's still a solid experience for the tension alone. The game takes its time to keep the player on the edge of their seat, so lackluster payoff doesn't really hurt the overall experience.
[hr][/hr]
[i]Story[/i]: If FEAR shows it's age anywhere, it's in the story and in the setting. If you enjoy the type of stories that were popular in the 2000's and up to early 2010's, its gonna work and you're unlikely to find any qualms about it. The setting was pretty novel when the game came out, but in the miserable age of 2023 it's not a controversial take to think that the setting is overused and lets you know what to expect. 
[spoiler]The story of this game is serviceable (which is more than enough for a 2005 FPS game, i guess), with my weighing points being the following:
Pros: 
• the final plot twist is good and explains the gameplay strength our ""rookie"" character has;
• the super-soldier army makes an interesting enemy narrative-wise;
• the firearms selection might be bland, but the fictional weapons look interesting and do break the mold somewhat. the games take on the SL-8 (G2A2 assault rifle) being my personal favorite
Cons:
• they try to explain the monster, which does downplay the horror significantly in my opinion;
• characters make things so irrational it's infuriating (primarily the segment with Alice, but i did buy a horror game, i suppose.);
• general inconsistencies and the rule of cool diminishing the horror aspect (i did buy a 2005 shooter too, should i really be here for the story that makes a lot of sense?)
[/spoiler]
As such, the story is nothing to write a four hour long video about and does drive the main point home.
[hr][/hr]
[i]Conclusion[/i]:The game's alright even 18 years after the release. Given that i gave 2 dollars for FEAR 1 to 3, it was an experience well worth it's price."

76561198141793941,1698598468,True,"Make sure you buy this bundle on sale for around $8. F.E.A.R. still holds up really well. It requires a little patch made by the community to optimize the frame rate but other than that it is still a great game. I played this years ago on Xbox 360 and revisiting it today was a great blast from the past. 

 The A.I. holds up extremely well and the dark, foreboding atmosphere does its job. The story is a bit cliche but it still hits its marks and is intriguing. It may have been done before but it is done well nevertheless. The A.I. and particle physics in combat are the real standout here though. Even today, the A.I. is top tier as they call out to each other and actively flank you, wait for you to come around a corner, or rush you. The particle physics and reactivity of the environment are also top tier even today. Bullets and explosions kick up dust and bits of drywall and concrete that obscure your vision and linger in the air. Papers, bits of computers and printers and everything else, go flying and just create amazing moments in firefights. It all feels impressive even today. Back in 2005, this was the game people becnhmarked their hardware with.

 If I have to give one or two critiques, the environments are a little stale and one of the ending sequence perplexed me. You hallucinate something and randomly lose all your weapons. It doesn't make the game harder or anything but it took me out of the immersion a bit. I felt like keeping your weapons would not have changed anything. 

 Cautiously approach the series knowing that F.E.A.R. 2 and 3 are not as good but at least you get more of the universe they made, which is a big draw. As for the Expansions, Extraction Point is the one wroth playing even if it isn't canon any more and Perseus Mandate can be avoided as it is kinda bad and also not canon anymore."

Overall, this is a linear shooter with some OK shooting and a nice slow-mo facility. Barks from the opposing forces are useful clues to their response to you, and it's nice that they seem to intelligently use grenades as a 'flush out' technique.

The actual story is a bit weird - welding together a fairly conventional shooter with some horror elements that fall fairly flat.
There's also a strange tonal inconsistency between the horror and a 'comedy fat guy' used as a plot device in several levels. The main pseudo-antagonist presented throughout the game died in a on one of the clumsy semi-cutscenes used to (attempt to) dump exposition - it was such a quick/strange story beat that I couldn't quite believe that it had happened with no apparent warning.

The game did also activate one of my pet hates: towards the end of the game, your arsenal of weapons, carefully curated/hoarded throughout the game is completely and arbitrarily removed. No need for this at all.

Overall, I sort of got the gist of the story, but found it largely muddy and unclear exactly what the details of what were going on were. Standard corridor shooter with bits welded on. It's a resounding 'this is ok-ish'. Will give the others in the series a go as already had them, but wouldn't prioritise this game as a buy."

76561198046034475,1698280392,True,"The base game of F.E.A.R. is fantastic. It does an amazing job of alternating between horror and action shooter genres. The pacing is great, it has solid exploration elements, and the gameplay holds up even today. I found the graphics to still hold up well, as well.

The first dlc, Extraction Point, is also a banger. It places much more emphasis on horror, kicking off with an uneasy atmosphere and ramping up the supernatural threats. It also introduces some fun new weapons in the process.

Both the base game and extraction point dlc are absolutely worth playing, and I'll likely revisit them again. Perseus Mandate, however, is an utter dumpster fire.

Perseus Mandate dlc feels very rushed and slapdash. It has some interesting new enemies to face and new mysteries to unravel, and in addition also adds more new weapons. However, it tries to focus more on the action aspects of the base game and somehow falls flat. The pacing is awful, enemy encounters bounce between ludicrously hard and painfully easy with seemingly no rhyme or reason, and enemies are designed to be tanks that shred your health nearly instantly while the game also deprives you of desperately needed health boosts.

The game is absolutely worth it for the base game and extraction point alone, thankfully.

People who don't understand my metaphor were likely not fortunate enough to be able to experience both games and the stories they provided. Jokes aside, however, you're still in for a treat regardless of your familiarity with shooters, horror, or sci-fi.

F.E.A.R is an aptly named First-Person Shooter that fits the bill for the kind of horror games I often call ""thrillers.""

Thrillers are those kind of horror experiences where it's like, ""Yeah, it's a zombie apocalypse, but you have guns, y'know?""

Inevitably, it's a bit difficult to truly feel defenseless, let alone ""not badass,"" so to say, when you give a horror protag guns and all the ammo needed to ""Rip and Tear UNTIL IT IS DONE!""

For me, this works just fine depending on how it's handled. F.E.A.R has AMAZING A.I and you'll have to make use of your explosives and Heavy Weapons to overcome hordes of fodder, badass heavies, or just to show off to your chooms in the Community Tab (you can shoot grenades mid-air, btw)."

FEAR was a pretty miraculous title back when it released in 2005. The combat felt very sophisticated; the TTK was short, the shading and post processing effects were amazing; contrasting the gloomy grey palette against the excessive emission shading of the explosions and muzzle fire, the stress inducing tunnel vision from the bullet time effect (which is probably its most defining mechanic). It felt ""real"" and visceral at the time. The AI was also quite something; enemies were proactively seeking cover and performing reconnaissance to find the player, while scattering out when danger turned out imminent. The lighting is really good even to this day. The ragdolls are outright amazing; they still put modern day titles to shame even now(I think it was PhysX?).

The problem with FEAR is that it just doesn't do anything that hasn't been done much better since. It was amazing then, and probably served as an example for years thereafter - but now we're well past it.

F.E.A.R. gameplay is about walking slowly, having a button to slow time down & shooting humans with maybe 10 different guns & 3 grenade types. Sometimes you get a flashback where you slowly walk & enemies that die in 1-2 bullets run at you.

If you ever hear people say it was ahead of it's time I'm not sure I agree, since there are games like Half-Life & Deus Ex that released 5 years before. This is a step back from something like Half-Life 1 overall: The level design is more linear & less thought out, and there's a lot less gameplay variance in general. 

I enjoyed the final parts of FEAR: higher enemy variance, higher enemy count, more weapons to use, more scripted action sequences & story being more densely packed. Even the beginning hour wasn't too bad since it was teaching you the mechanics. 
It's really only the middle part that doesn't impress with it's lack of story & fighting the same enemies nonstop for about 3 hours.

A fear that is not just because of a little girl.

76561199556631650,1697386439,True,"F.E.A.R. on PC: A Review by an FPS Enthusiast

As an FPS enthusiast with a penchant for classics like Halo, Bioshock, and Black Mesa, I was eager to dive into F.E.A.R., a title that has garnered a cult following over the years. I snagged it on Steam for a mere $2, and let me tell you, it was a steal.

Gameplay and Atmosphere
F.E.A.R. is a first-person shooter that masterfully blends horror elements with intense combat. The game places you in the shoes of a member of the First Encounter Assault Recon, a military task force dealing with paranormal activities. Your mission? To neutralize Paxton Fettel, a rogue military commander who has taken control of an army of telepathically-linked cloned soldiers.

The game's atmosphere is heavily influenced by Japanese horror movies, creating an unsettling experience. The game designers have done an excellent job of building tension, often leaving you in stretches where you don't encounter any enemies but feel a constant sense of dread.

Combat and AI
The combat in F.E.A.R. is nothing short of cinematic. The gunplay feels visceral, and the AI is some of the most aggressive and tactically oriented I've ever encountered in a shooter. They'll pin you down, flank you, and even use the game's physics to create cover. Your arsenal is formidable, and you'll need it to survive the relentless AI.

F.E.A.R.'s horror components are nothing short of fantastic. As a fan of first-person shooters, I've seen my fair share of ""scary moments"" in games, but F.E.A.R. takes it to the next level. There were parts of the game that actually scared me. The atmosphere is tense, and the game designers understand psychology; they know when to hold back and when to unleash dread. It's not only about what you see, but also about what you don't. The fear, the anticipation—it all adds up to moments that had me jumping out of my seat.

But it's not just the terror that has me captivated; the AI is also impressive. I've battled innumerable virtual rivals, but the antagonists in F.E.A.R. are in a league of their own. They're not merely impediments to be mowed down; they're smart, strategic, and downright vicious. They adapt, flank, and take advantage of their surroundings. It's a task that keeps you on your toes, perfectly mixing with the horror parts of the game to produce an experience that's as mentally hard as it is emotionally exhausting.

In short, F.E.A.R. offers an unrivaled blend of terror and intellectual action, making it a must-play for any FPS fan. It's a game that gets under your skin and remains there.

Technical Issues
I did encounter some technical issues initially, but these were resolved after installing an FPS smoothing file available through the F.E.A.R. community. Post-fix, the game ran smoothly, enhancing the overall experience.

Room for Improvement
While the game excels in many areas, it does have its shortcomings. The environments can feel repetitive, and the AI, despite being brilliant, could use more variety. The plot, although complete, leaves some threads hanging, making the ending a bit of a letdown.

 Final Thoughts
F.E.A.R. is an intense, atmospheric shooter that offers some of the best gunplay in the genre. It's a must-play for any FPS enthusiast, especially at its current price point on Steam. Despite some minor flaws, the game delivers an experience that is both thrilling and terrifying, making it a classic in its own right."

76561198025092826,1697329821,True,"Best singleplayer campaign shooter of all time? Arguably.

If you like action games and horror, or just horror styled games, this game is the perfection of that,

-Ambience/Atomosphere: perfect.
-Mechanics:  perfect.
-Shooting: perfect (first person animations aren't the best though)
-Pacing: perfect.
-Story and characters: Surely not Shakespeare writing, but pretty fucking good and memorable.
-Visuals: The kind that doesn't age for some reason, combined with all the effects, particles... amazing.
-Some technical issues, like almost every old abandonware game, but easily fixed with a few patches. You can't play at very high framerates without visual artifacts regardless, sadly.

One of my favorite games of all time, ageless, a joy to replay and replay even 18 years after it's release.

It's not even nostalgia talking, although i heard of this game 10+ years ago, and it's existence crossed my mind a few times, i never really gave it a proper try until the beginning of this year 2023, when the bundle popped up on my recommended cause it was on sale, and i fell in love with it anyway.

Only con is you have to buy that bundle, which goes for 50 bucks, and the other included content/games aren't anything to write home about.

Still, it regularly goes on sale for about 8 bucks, which you can't deny it's a pretty good deal for all of that.

Hell, it's a good deal just for this one game alone.

Just wishlist it and wait a little bit."

76561199147028014,1696798086,True,"[h1] FEAR: Time-Bending Firefight Excellence [/h1]

FEAR thrusts players into a whirlwind of first-person gunplay, where time slows down, bullets fly, and chaos reigns supreme. This mechanic, while somewhat arbitrary in the game's context, transforms every encounter into a breathtaking, explosive spectacle. The sheer thrill of slowing time and witnessing bodies contort as bullets pierce them is unmatched.

The game excels in crafting intense, visually stunning combat sequences. The slow-motion gun battles are the crown jewel here, offering a level of clarity and detail that rivals Max Payne's cinematic moments. As you tackle foes with precision, shattering glass, and orchestrating bullets' deadly ballet, the experience becomes riveting.

FEAR's use of the Reflux mechanic to enhance the action is commendable. However, the game doesn't rely solely on this gimmick. It introduces a range of powerful weapons, including the Penetrator, MP-50 heavy cannon, and a satisfying shotgun. These weapons add variety and excitement to the gameplay, but the true essence lies in the slow-motion gunplay.

The game's visuals, although highly detailed, serve more as a backdrop to the action than a centerpiece. The environments, while sometimes overly detailed, mostly serve as arenas for thrilling encounters. While the combat is excellent, FEAR occasionally stumbles outside of it, with limited environmental interaction and contrived puzzles.

FEAR infuses elements of horror into its storyline, drawing inspiration from Asian horror themes. The narrative follows a paranormal assault team's pursuit of a rogue psychic commander and features unsettling events, flashbacks, and psychological twists. However, the story, while intriguing, may not fully satisfy those seeking deep narrative engagement.

Exploration is minimal, and puzzles feel forced and uninspired. Despite these shortcomings, the game's core focus on intense, strategic gunfights keeps it compelling. The AI opposition shines, especially on higher difficulty levels, making battles exhilarating.

In conclusion, FEAR is a game that thrives on its slow-motion gunplay, offering a unique and exhilarating experience. While its storytelling and environmental aspects may falter at times, the heart-pounding combat more than compensates. It's a title that reminds us of the sheer fun that FPS games can deliver."

76561198255716355,1696728535,True,"An amazing blend of tactical, action and horror game. On higher difficulties you can't treat this like a standard FPS otherwise you will become swiss cheese in less than a second.
The level design is superb, along with stunning graphics (for a 2005 game) made the whole experience a treat.

It did require a little work to getting it run at 60fps (just finding a file and dropping into the games files), but other than that runs great."
76561198072916403,1696710416,True,"A fun romp of an action game. Half John Woo action film, half intense ghost story, all incredibly interesting and fun to play.

I was impressed by the enemy AI in this game; for a 2005 game that released on the 360, I was impressed on how quickly the AI could change tactics and analyze how to flank and surround you quickly. Despite that, you are given a wide array of fun guns to use, that while are just variations of classic FPS gun archetypes, have fun designs and are designed to take on certain play styles well. I really enjoyed how interactive the environments were, as every fight felt like it had some carnage to it that I appreciated as I played.

I would say there are three weaknesses to the game. One, its grey corridors for a large part of the game, which does not surprise me for a game from this era of gaming. Two, I love the slow motion ability, but on normal, its too easy to slow the game down, toss a grenade, and click on the remaining heads. its just a really easy game. Three, its short and ends abruptly, just as some of the mystery was unveiled. Definitely recommend the game."

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]The overall atmosphere is really well done. Many dark sections with natural lighting really gives a spooky feeling on every level. Your flashlight is your best friend here since many sections can be really dark. The textures and graphics are okay. Nothing impressive but it aged pretty well especially for a 2005 game. The coolest part of the game is the particle effects and semi destructions. Shooting at walls and throwing grenades causing tons of smoke and table, glass, and many other objects to be destroyed. This makes every combat situation look really intense and truly immerse you into the fight. One complaint that I have to say is that the map design doesn't really change all that much (With some exceptions). Many levels just look the same and can get stale after a while.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The combat is pretty linear but really fun and addicting. The guns sound really good and you have a good variety of weapons to use that all feel unique. You have a cool ability called reflex mode. This ability allows you to go in slow motion for a limited time. This really helps when going against tougher enemies, or just enjoy causing chaos in slow mo (it never gets old). The level design is super liner, but is well designed. Many sections are fun to go through and do give a bit of a spooky factor (especially with the amazing atmosphere). The AI are really smart in this game. Enemies will flank you, use grenades and can give you a feel surprises. Also the comms between each other are pretty realistic and entertaining to hear. The ragdoll effects are also awesome to see and never get old, especially when you use a shotgun at close range.[/td]

    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story is pretty good. It’s nothing memorable, but it has some pretty good twists (and scary moments) in the game. You will encounter many moments that are pretty well done as well. I’d say that some scares were pretty predictable, and sadly the game ends with a cliffhanger. It’s not a bad cliffhanger by any means, but if you want to get more story bits after the main game, then play the expansion packs which are actually pretty good.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]The story is around 6-8 hours long which is pretty good I guess. The expansion packs will add much needed playtime which comes with the FEAR Complete Pack. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is good. The weapons sound really good, and the AI have amazing banter between each other. The voice acting is actually not that bad, but the music is pretty forgettable and kinda just in the background.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I haven't really came across any bugs with this game. I never been stuck on anything or seen any odd behavior from the AI. In terms of bugs, this game is pretty optimized.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]Now for performance, this game does have issues. Memory issues do plague the game and frame rate issues are an occurrence (mostly an issue with the expansion packs). Luckily there is a patch that fixes most of the problems. You can download a 4GB patch which I will link for you.[/td]

Many cool sections with a pretty solid story. FEAR provides a great experience with awesome gunplay. Prepare to get scared and don’t let your FEARS stop you from escaping this h*ll![/td]

76561198312775328,1694374152,True,"john woo style action paired with psychological and atmospheric horror elements are an interesting combination thus it allows player to deal with horror elements through unorthodox means which is better than the traditional cat and mouse style that we know today however the real deal is not the concept of the game but rather its story that takes the cake it can make hideo kojimas mgs an absolute garbage and yeah i actually said that pair it with supreme gameplay elements such bullet time enemy reactions, callouts and ai you get this masterpiece 10/10 would play it for the 3 time (i pirated the game prior to this when i was young) now that we took care of gameplay and story lets look into the ""merchandise"":
horror element:
this game made 12 year old wolf0911145 shidd into his chair also this game made 20 year old wolf0911145 heartbeat erratic the game tortures you through apparitions of the dead (aka spectres, ghosts) and force you to relive their last moments, it can generate hallucinations from a warped reality that can actually hurt you in phyical world (aka nightmare spawns), best of it all you can shoot and disrupt all these apparitions which will skip the entire encounter altogether but some are scripted not to (due to story and enemy type reveals) also an advice dont shoot at ""the girl"" during these its not real its a spectre you gonna spend your precious ammo and you gonna piss her off but the game will let you know when you need to cap her so dont worry about that
gameplay element:
ai learns the way you fight and deal with you according to that (traditional fuck around and find out system) and you gonna respect npcs a lot (definetly not a foreshadowing of getting wallbang across the map with autocannon giggity) oh and no hand holding litteraly everthing is done through significant brain usage (puzzles, boosters and enemy archtypes and how you deal with them giggity) oh and uhhhh do not fear the atc security they usally find end in your hands but replicas? dont worry they will find you before you find them (cough shock troops cought assassins cough heavies cough rev6s cough recons cough snipers gasp elites
conclusion:
a better story than hideo kojimas mgs
a horror and atmophere that tops of stalker dead space resident evil dino crisis
a gameplay that can rival medal of honor duke nukem blood shadow warrior doom and quake
a masterpiece that every gamer should play otherwise they have no right to call themselves gamer"

76561198294172648,1694107003,False,"First off, let me start this by saying that the F.E.A.R. games themselves are not bad by any means. They're very fun and I'd say they're worth it if you like horror but love some action too. 

The negative part of this review is the fact that you can only acquire these games via this bundle. That wouldn't be so bad if you had the option to purchase each individual game, but you can't. I had to drop 50 bucks on this bundle just so I could play the first game and the expansions. (I do plan on playing F.E.A.R. 2 but not 3, unless I have a friend to play with.) Not everyone is so willing to blow 50 bones on a bundle of games they might not even like. Bring back the ability to purchase each game individually so more people can enjoy your game."

76561198003682769,1693912318,True,"It may be a little old but the atmosphere, story and gunplay hold up. I'd say this is a "" psychological horror "" game and not just a horror game with jumpscares . It does have some jumpscare moments but I'd say it's the plot, creepiness and mystery what make F.E.A.R. scary. 

You play as the point man of a special forces team called F.E.A.R. . The mission is something that exceeds the worst fears of the biggest pessimists -fight against a battalion of military clones who are controlled by a psychic commander . However the point man is a bit more "" special "" due to his very fast reflexes .

Side notes : F.E.A.R has still some of the most impressive AI to this day. I like how they interact with the environment to take cover or flank the player. You can also hear their comms which reveal their current status."

76561198098566230,1693857611,True,"I have no nostalgia for this game, I came at it purely from a fresh angle already knowing most of what it was about.

Slow-mo shotgunning/jump karate kicking clone soldiers that are freaking out, and getting crazy ragdolls or violently destroying the environment? Never gets old. Good AI and levels, fun weapons (I don't like the smg or ar much but they're fine), very fun action game. The horror is . . . there. 

The genuine worst thing about it right now is that you have to but F.E.A.R. 3 to get it. Which is a terrible crime.

Easy recommendation. (Probably wait for a decent sale because you have to get other games alongside it.)"

On the real, this holds up incredibly well and even the visuals on modern hardware can look incredibly impressive. The AI is leaps and bounds of what you would find in a modern FPS, the gunplay is stellar and the slow-time mechanic is up there with Max Payne.

10/10 for fans of FPS, especially those where you can just go wild against leagues of helpless mooks."

F.E.A.R. is definitely one of the greatest FPS games to come out at the time it was released. For the time it came out this game was ahead of it's time. The AI is really crazy on the higher difficulties that they tend to have a effective strategy to kill you as you playthrough the game. A lot of singleplayer campaign shooters these days seem to not have AI this good. The gunplay is really fun I do like myself some bullet time action as well as using weapons that have weight to them against my enemies! Don't forget seeing them explode in slow motion as you throw a grenade at em! The horror elements in this game are really nice it's got a very unsettling atmosphere along with some creepy ambient tracks, no cheap and crappy jumpscares here, just some well made psychological horror. 

I had no issues running this game on my current modern system only issue I came across is the extremely low FPS which was easily fixed by putting a dll file into my games installation. I do recommend waiting for a sale on the FEAR Complete Pack if you plan on buying this game. I've picked it up for about 9 dollars, what a steal!
Other than that if you really enjoyed this game check out a game called Trepang2, it's a really great game inspired by this game!

TLDR: Epic game from 2005 (along with others released at that time). Very good bullet time gorilla man warfare gameplay. Better big brain capuchin monke AI than most modern day cod of dookie campaigns. Scary game and it made me fart it D:

76561197970459421,1692218494,True,"""F.E.A.R. is still really cool and a badass game. The gunplay, slow-motion mechanics, and AI scripting of F.E.A.R. can still hold up against contemporary shooters and surpasses (unfortunately) a lot of newer games. The jumpscares were cringeworthy back then and still are. The story, however, is lackluster. Nonetheless, it's still awesome to blast enemies in dual pistol mode while running, sliding, and jumping in slow motion. From Monolith's heyday, just like No One Lives Forever. Whether you're a zoomer or identify as some sort of non-binary creature, you should definitely have played this game.""
"
76561198360345402,1692202515,True,"After playing through this, I 100% get why many see this as the best game Monolith ever produced. However, the passage of time has not been kind to F.E.A.R. and its expansions (those will get their own review soon), and has made this amazing experience far more difficult to deal with.

PROS:
- the gunplay is immensely satisfying and very responsive, which provides an immediate dopamine rush once you send a guy flying
- speaking of dudes flying, the ragdoll physics are hilarious and so fun to mess around with
- i can only really think of one gun that i never used, which really goes to show how fun the weapon sandbox is
- the scares in the game really did catch me off guard a couple times, and still manages to make you feel uneasy without feeling super cheap.

CONS:
- This is by far the most work i've had to put into a game to work. You have to run the main game in Windows XP compatibility on Windows 10, AND you need to grab multiple fixes just to get the game to start. Like holy sh*t, why do I need to do this much for one game???
- Multiple bugs regardless. Most are harmless; Some are irritating and forced me to use cheats to finish the game (guy shooting me in the f*cking floor)
- Special melee attacks are nice and all, but they either don't work at times or get instantly blocked and YOU get smacked up.
- Need I mention that you need to buy F.E.A.R. Complete at $60 USD for just the first game?
- This could be due to the framerate being pumped to 60, but sometimes it just felt like enemies were hitscanning while my bullets were mostly projectile. I could be wrong, but I remember multiple times where I saw a bullet whiz past me and I still took damage from it.

Overall, it's a really fun game with a massive chip on its shoulder. I only wish that WB Games or somebody would remaster F.E.A.R. and its expansions so people don't have to wrestle with the game for it to work.
But oh man, when you get this game to work, it's a action-packed blast.
8.5/10"
76561198068082010,1692185374,True,"Not really as good as I remembered it to be back in the day, but decent nonetheless.

- A lot of vfx during combat: sparks shower everything, inanimate objects go flying, walls emit dust that hangs in clouds. Very exaggerated, very chaotic, a bit over the top.
- Enemies act realistically and use proper tactics: they cover each other, try to flank you, lay ambushes etc. Also they are fair, they operate based on what they see or hear, like, you can make some noise to make them think you are in the place A, move and flank them while they try to get you at that place A. You can hear them talking to each other, giving orders and arguing. For me, the enemies are the best part of the game.
- Levels are mostly linear, but wherever you need to go, there is always at least two paths and some hidden stuff - a little exploration element.
- Not a lot of weapon variety, but every type has its niche and feels very satisfying.
- Action sequences alternate with plot/horror sequences, which relieves some of repetitiveness, although, closer to the end I still wanted the game to end already.
- The story is meh. You chase one guy for 10 hours, while uncovering corporate secrets and experiencing horror.

All in all, the game is old and it shows, but its mechanical core is so good that it still holds up even in 2023"
76561198029352522,1692159526,True,"Man this game is so good. Even after all this time. I still remember when my cousin dared me to play the demo of the first game on his PC right when it came out. I've been a fan ever since. 

I don't even like scary movies but I love this game, Perfect balance of action/horror.

And at this point the game will run on any potato system from the last 13 years. 

However the fact that the first game + Expansions still don't have proper controller support is a crime against humanity. 

I've been playing it mostly on console for that reason.  

Fantastic series on any platform.

Overall, this is an immersive shooter that while challenging at times can be really enjoyable. The A.I is good, the game play is enjoyable.

76561198841446407,1691764402,True,"I finally got around to play one of the fathers of the Bullet time FPS genre. F.E.A.R easily topped as one of the best FPS games I've ever played. Its Dark/Gritty environment was perfect for being a tac shooter and horror aesthetic. When it comes to the weapons, the devs spared no time in the fun aspect of things pretty much letting you use whatever you want for the entire game. I think we can all agree that the shot gun in shoot em ups is the best part, but for some reason most games restrict the player with limited ammo but in F.E.A.R like I said before there are no restrictions so you can use the Spas12 til your heat shield melts and your barrel explodes. Last thing Ill say, Is you can definitely tell this game was inspired by Half Life 2. (most games were at the time) I say this because the Jupiter EX engine kept reminding me of Source which is a good thing for me because I have a huge love for the source engine. F.E.A.Rs gun fights are way ahead of its time the devs made sure every prop is super detailed and has a reaction. When shooting metal sparks will fly out everywhere, when hitting concrete chunks fly off leaving giant impact holes and dust fills the air, when shooting printers or books the room is swallowed in paper. Overall If you always wanted to play a tac shooter but also be in a horror game F.E.A.R is def the perfect choice. I hope you enjoyed it just as mush as me. 

my only complaint was the flashlight, for some reason it has an energy bar that shuts off if you use it for too long and you will have to wait a few seconds for it to come back and worst of all its range is terrible which sucks for a game that's extremity dark for like 40% of the game."

76561198109885000,1691185835,True,"After completing FEAR and its expansions, I can say these are mostly awesome games. FEAR's combat system and slow-mo is very fun, the guns feel good, the AI is engaging to play against, and I really liked the story and its horror elements (which gave me many good scares). I was thoroughly engaged to the end. And for a game from 2005, the graphics and lighting are amazing. FEAR and EP have such rich atmospheres. It really surpassed my expectations. 

Extraction Point is pretty much more of that classic FEAR gameplay. The environments are more varied, and the graphics and lighting are on par with FEAR- in fact, they're better in some places. I also had fun with it and liked its story, and the horror elements also gave me some good scares.

Perseus Mandate is where it starts to fall apart. If I had to describe it in one word, I'd say ""confusing"". Its story is worse than FEAR and EP, and your two squadmates (Raynes and Chen) are not as well written as Holiday and Jin. It's more action-focused and has less horror elements, but for the most part I still enjoyed it and had fun... until I reached Interval 7. It's a [i]total slog[/i] to get through. The environments look extremely samey and a lot of the arenas are poorly designed. It's also full of Nightcrawler Elites which are [b]absolute bullet sponges[/b] and move ridiculously fast, essentially forcing you to fight them in slow-mo. One of its arenas contained FOUR of them plus normal Nightcrawlers and I literally had to lower the difficulty to clear it because I kept dying- and I was only on Normal! And unlike FEAR and EP, this expansion's ending felt rather unsatisfying and abrupt.
Speaking of environments, this expansion's use of lighting is... interesting. There's a lot of areas that look hideous, have very flat lighting, and don't make proper use of the dynamic lighting system at all. However, there's also a lot of areas that are on par with FEAR and EP.

Overall, FEAR and Extraction Point are awesome games and I highly recommend them. Perseus Mandate is meh, but as long as you lower your expectations it shouldn't be too unbearable- I did enjoy most of it, after all."

I can't leave a negative because this is a review from 2023, for 2005 this is an epic level of technical achievement that can be felt whilst playing, it's quite eye opening just how bad some newer games are at AI and gun play.

The game becomes repetitive by around interval 5, it loses all of it's magic if any it had to start with.

There is zero difficulty to any enemy engagement if you are around average or above average at shooting with a mouse.

Other than that though? yeah it's a run of the mil shooter campaign not bad and by today's standards not good either."
76561198326174017,1691100080,True,"I enjoyed this game quite a bit more than I thought I would. For a shooter from 2005, the gameplay certainly feels ahead of its time with very fluid movement that feels all the more satisfying with the slow motion mechanics and ragdoll physics. The story isn't exactly groundbreaking for the horror game genre, but it weaves some unique horror elements into its enemy types and level design that makes up for it. Definitely a game worth giving a try when it goes on sale.

One thing to note is there's a bug in the game that slowly decreases your FPS over time, so I would recommend downloading the patch for this problem before starting your playthrough."

76561198866327448,1691047853,True,"STILL UNDEFEATED!
I've replayed Fear and tried BlackOps Cold War in the same month - and let me tell u - when it comes to combat CoD got NOTHING over original Fear! 
 Gunplay in this game is just on another level, AAA games can't touch it TILL THIS DAY. Best bulletholes in fps genere ever. Best use of particle effects in fps game ever. Best granades (that explosion ripple effect is art) in fps game ever. And all that in SLO-MO :DD 
 Same with enemies - their maneuvers, switching covers, reactions to your actions, heavy ragdolls, radio chats etc... There's nothing else like it. 
 Atmosphere ... so thick you could cut it with a knife. Alma is a celebrity in gaming world today, but when I saw her for the first time, I was scared like a little kid (well, I was a kid at that point, but whateva, still scary)
 Level-design ... tailor-cut exactly for this game's combat system, lets you (and the bad guys) play cat and mouse all day long - yet at the same time gives you uncanny vibe of exploring somewhat familiar places, but twisted and looking like something from a bad dream.

  It's just sooooo impressive that Monolith somehow managed to mix together an action power fantasy turned-up to the max, with spooky atmosphere from horrors. This is their magnum opus, amazing feat of game-dev proficiency that not many came close to - TILL THIS DAY!"

76561197971685964,1690751249,True,"Old wise man said: ages like fine wine.

This 2005 FPS still holds up nowadays, and it's in charge to teach some mechanics to the modern genre (no COD, I'm not looking at you, you're hopeless). I have fond memories of playing this game on my ancient AMD Athlon XP 1,7Ghz at the time.

But as a new player, what are you going to find?

F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault and Recon) is a linear FPS set in a modern urban scenario, where you control Point Man, the newest team member of F.E.A.R. secret squad. Our goal is to investigate into the munity of commander Paxton Fettel, who is in charge of a particular army of clones, all controlled telephatically.
The man launches an assault on the city of Fairport, USA and our job is to figure its intentions and stop him being a threat. But the whole operation will reveal sinister outcomes, often questioning reality. 

Without adding further plot details, F.E.A.R. plays like a linear shooter, where the player must complete objectives and kill everything it moves in sight. The gunplay is composed by a variety of firearms, spacing from classic assault rifles to technologically advanced weaponry like railguns (that fries enemies instantly). Every piece is fun to fire and you can feel the impact of every gun, each one with its quirks and strengths. 
The protagonist can also punch enemies with a couple of moves (even a flying kick!), and there's available a cinematic slow motion mode, where time slows down and you move faster than your foes. This ability in particular will come up useful in some of the intense shootings, where you will be always outnumbered. 

One of the strengths of the game is undoubtedly all the battles you'll have to face with the AI soldiers, because they're not only cannon fodder, but they try to act as a team. And these are not the dumb modern enemies: they're going to try to flank you, flush you out from your cover and outsmart you in every encounter. Of course, they're still bots and sometimes they do seem not so smart, but if you get distracted your ass will be kicked for sure. In some cases they're also going to use the environment as an advantage, by creating temporary covers or navigate the rooms trying to hide and ambush you.

In my honest opinion, this is one of the best implementation of AI soldiers in a videogame. And it still holds up today. The AI in modern FPS is just embarassing.

The game itself contours with a modern-horror atmosphere, where some paranormal elements will come up in the plot. It doesn't pretend to reinvent o revolutionize anything, but the atmosphere works. Everything is dark, thanks to the realtime illumination, and generally you're going to use the flashlight a lot when exploring the environments. The story is not original but sufficiently interesting for continuing to play the game, with some memos to find in order to give context to the events, in the forms of messages in answering machines or laptops to hack.

Considering that it's a 2005 title, graphically it defends itself, even if the models and the polygon count it's limited. 

And for me, if you look down you can see your legs, that's a plus in an FPS :)

So, if you're looking for a horror-themed FPS with spectacular and engaging combat, you will find a solid and fun title. I've completed the campaign at maximum difficulty in 9 hours circa.

At the moment I can't talk about the multiplayer, because the official servers are closed.

Some notes:
The game works well with Windows 10 (latest patched, 22H2), but some fixes are needed in order to enjoy the game. Personally I've used the FOV patch and another patch to solve some random FPS drops. You'll find more info here:

This is not a horror game, it is a linear tactical shooter with a few spooky bits. it's janky but the core gameplay is still good. 
It feels like one person on the dev team was absolutely dead-set on making this a horror game and everyone else decided to compromise. Horror elements seem to have been sprinkled in late in development to break up the extremely repetitive office sections. 
"
76561198213908437,1690540535,True,shotgun funny
76561198281072985,1690521101,True,"Fear really doesn't get enough credit. It does a lot to distance itself from the ""norm"" of FPS's at the time, while still keeping the core of the game fun and familiar to those who like that style of game.

[h1] The Good [/h1]
Lets start with the most important thing, the gameplay. It's very good, the guns feel awesome and responsive. You've got all the main staples of FPS's, the SMG, assault rifle, rocket launcher, you know the ones. Some stand out weapons though iare the nail gun that if you shoot someone who in front of a wall they stick to it which is equal parts brutal and awesome. The the gun that melts the skin off of people (I forget whats its called). 

Next is the AI. I've only hard complaints when someone mentions AI in reviews but this time it's very impressive. The enemy will call out your exact position ""He's by the vending machine, next to the door, near the broken down car"". Things like this are very impressive for 2005 but it doesn't end there. During my playthrough one dude pushed over a filing cabinet or something to block a door, i then saw a different dude crawl underneath it to come get me. That is a rare thing to see with games released today. This also works with how combat usually plays out. You don't walk into a room everyone immediately notices you and starts shooting you. No, in Fear when you enter a room they don't, so you have time to work out how to go about how you handle the enemies. It adds a level of planning thinking to combat which more FPS's should do. I also love how it makes it feel like a cat and mouse game. 

Lastly Fear's stand out mechanic, the bullet time. Because in the early to mid 2000's slow motion was the coolest sh*t ever, apparently. Well Fear embraces the slightly goofiness of it and goes very over the top with it, which is 100% the right move. Every time you hit that button, you know the lobby scene in the matrix, well that's the best way to describe it. In bullet time there is so much sh""t flying everywhere, so many particle effects it's hard not to have fun. Also when you exit bullet time all those particle effects linger in the air and slowly fall back down, it makes you look at the absolute destruction you just caused. I don't kink i explained that well but you will know what i'm talking about if you play it. 

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
Hmmmm not much really just a few  little things that can be improved. I had no clue what is going on in the story and it's poorly told overall, I though it was a bit easy throughout, i played on the hardest difficulty and i was blazing through levels, but i would till recommend playing on this difficulty. I'm i missing something? Oh yeah it's a horror game, apparently, well it's not in anyway scary. A little girl flashes on screen occasionally and sometimes appears behind you and the light flicker. It's trying to be scary, it should have just had a horror theme if that's what they wanted. 

[h1] Concision [/h1]
Should you get it? Yes, its just a very fun FPS that has a unique charm to it that not many other game can reproduce and there's free DLC as well that is also good and adds a few more guns to mess around with."

76561198110601527,1689613447,True,"One of the best shooters ive ever player. Enemy AI is reactive and plans very well against  you, weapons are great and feel, sound and manage great and the level design and atheistic makes it so that when all of this is put together you have one of the most complete shooter experiences, were moment to moment game play and gunfights work, and make the player both feel a great sense of adrenaline but also force him to plan and think thru out all of his encounters.
On the other hand the game has both an interesting plot, but a very lacking story. I say this because, the way the mystery that is set up at the start of the game is quite interesting, and its really great how the games plot unravels around the character and how the player is involved in basically discovering this plot thru voice messages and computer terminals. On the other hand the game has some very boring characters, not one stood out for me and in general the games story was very formulaic. With its intend to ""scare"" the player being kind of boring and disruptive to the great game play. Also the both unnecessary and very predictable plot twist at the end was kind of dumb. 
In all, the meat of FEAR lies in its game play and the very out of the way approach that the plot points are handled so they (for the most part) don't interrupt the flow of the game. FEAR is a great game, except for the last level which is literally killing slow moving ghost, it was very underwhelming. Play the game thoe"

76561198254135851,1689525457,True,"F.E.A.R. has always been one of those games that I had heard being mentioned online way back in the early 2010s for being an absolutely amazing horror game but then it seemed to fade into obscurity and can only really be found on the occasional ""Top 10 Spooky Games"" videos you see YouTubers pump out in October. So when I bought it, I actually never bothered to get around to it for the longest time, and when I did I was really happy to say that it managed to hold up brilliantly, especially for being made in 2005. Nearly two decades old at the time of writing. 

The game had me gripped from beginning to end, with a tense and thick atmosphere, which just swells and swells the more you progress through the game. The combat is extremely fluid, and again considering it's time period I'd even say it was ahead of the curve by a good decade or so with the lean/peak mechanics, and the slide mechanic too which is a staple now in modern FPS games. The AI is also surprisingly clever, on many occasions I have been boxed in or flanked by enemies, which I rarely see in most games (not to say it isn't present in some), but on the other hand this could also be a testament to how good the level/area design is for these encounters to happen. 

Lastly I would also like to include that this was the first game in years to get me so invested in the story it was trying to tell that it genuinely compelled me read up on the lore supplements outside of the games, i.e the Dark Horse Comic Book and the Alma Interviews. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is even slightly curious about this old ass game, very fun, very immersive, very scary, and an all around blast to play."

The game ran me a little under 10 hours on the highest difficulty (which is not all that hard if you play tactically, which the game is built around) and i felt like it ended right when it needed to.

Getting lots of Half life vibes from this , excellent single player experience and i havent even completed it all yet.
The gun play is solid , the guns feel good to shoot. You can tell the shots are meaty af , especially on shotgun.

The enemy ai has so much going on for it , i reckon its better than even some post 2020 titles. 

Some of the scares got me good(im the kind of person that doesn't get scared easily)

Also a change in keybinds helped me immensely  and that was setting zoom to m2 and melee to shift"

76561198421332007,1688930600,True,"This game's campaign is something else, and the memories that i had with this game... I played it long time ago on a very old pc. I was barely getting 30 fps (on slow-mo it was getting even lower) but i really enjoyed it back then. Even though i was playing on a low-end pc, i still managed to get to the first half of the game. But unfortunately, i didn't finish it and left it unfinished for years... Fast forward in 2021, i saw a video from my favorite content creator and it was featuring this game. When i saw that video, i was like ""wait, isn't this the game that i have left unfinished?). At the end of the video, he said the game's price are incredibly low on sale (the time were 2021 winter sale was happening). I decided the buy the game and finish it.
just one word:
masterpiece.
Back then when i was playing on a low-end pc, I was still enjoying the game. But this time, the visuals, combat, particles flying, the slow mo, audio, overall smoothness of the gameplay. I was really not expecting something like this. The game was EVEN better than i remembered. I was literally saying to myself 'why did i left this game unfinished, this is a fucking masterpiece'. 
There is only one thing that i don't like about this game is probably the near ending parts. Was a little bit boring but overall, this is and will be my GOAT game.
Just like Half-Life,
This is one of those kind of games where you can finish it and come back months/years after and it will still feel fresh. 
Oh and lastly,
Multiplayer (sec2/fear combat) is frickin awesome. All of the melee in the normal game is allowed and the most of the matches are ridiculous as hell.

10/10."
76561198074083431,1688920486,True,"Not a great game when compared to this gen but it is definetly in some of the best fps games that released in 2005 along side with CoD 2, King Kong, Serious Sam 2, Swat 4 etc.

The only interesting piece about this game is the AI. When you play at the hardest difficulty and shut your brain it is actually challenging-- the way they try to surround you, creating covers by dropping the vending machines.. and that's about it really, if the fight is in a rather medium sized place with some cover it can be fun but if it is in a big open place you just headshot everyone from afar and if it is in a small space you just mowe people down with your shotgun. Also even if you increase the difficulty game gives you way too much ammo and medpacks, there has been times that I was full and had to pass 7 medkits (yes I counted, specifically at the 5th chapter when you encounter the first living civilian). Story also leaves a lot to be desired, but I haven't finished the game yet so can't quite say that I guess. While it is interesting the presentation is not great, If i hadn't gone out of my way to get the voice messages I wouldn't know key factors of the story."

76561198879150108,1688691924,True,"As you may have guessed, this is not a professional review but rather my own opinion, so read it like that. In the past, I heard about this game but had no courage to play it. After many years, thanks to the Steam Summer Sale, I bought the whole series. I am writing this review after playing all three main Fear Games, and I can say it's the best in the series. I am going to rewiew this game on three sides. Atmosphere, gameplay, and story.

Game Atmosphere feels good because it's suitable for the horror genre; it's dark but not too dark. They did a good job of creating a consistent atmosphere. I played very cautiously because of the dark atmosphere; it was tense, and while fighting enemies, you start to be careful for horror aspects because the game does not use cheap jump scares a lot. It depends on its atmosphere and other scary moments. Graphics are good for a 2005 game, and for me, it is as good as BF2 and Republic Commandos. Fear has more attention than Republic commandos and same as BF2

Fear 1 has great gameplay. You name it, it feels great to use guns; they are not clanky, especially pistols. I used my single pistol through my whole gameplay, except for mini-boss fights. You can understand if you use your pistol while ads and peeking at the same time. Even explosions feel awesome because if you throw your nade close, you will feel a satisfactory shake. It's not absurd from a gameplay aspect, and for that, I always played close quarter combat; for me, it was much better than distance combat. And with all that, you have a slow-time skill. Unfortunately, most of those aspects are not good in other Fear games, like Fear 2 and 3. I don't know why, but there is no peeking or quicksaving in other fears. If you play the fear games in order and consecutively, you're going to feel the same as me: Fear 1 is better in every aspect than the other main fear games.

Fear 1 has a good story. If I want to write about the short story of the game without spoiling much, I can say that You begin the game as a US Special Forces F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) named Point Man, and you are given the task of capturing a Leader of special U.S. clone soldiers. The story can seem simple; you play as an ordinary soldier, but the story expends on those aspects in a good way and makes you feel satisfied not only with the plot but with the atmosphere.

Unfortunately, you can't play this game without patches, unlike Star Wars: Republic Commandos. Vanilla Fear doesn't support today's standard 1920x1080p resolution and has a low FOV. Other important issues are low fps and a small font for 1920x1080p resolution. I played Fear 1 with an Rtx 3060 laptop gpu, a 7 11600h, and 32 GB of ram, but with that, I could only get ridiculous fps between 10 and 30 fps. But fortunately, there is a patch for that. By the way, these patches only took 10 minutes to install and play.

At the end of this review, I m going to compare the three Fear games with each other.

Story: Fear 1>2>3

Gameplay: 1>2>3 (Btw, Fear 3 has good gameplay, but unlike previous Fear games, it takes more time to kill enemies, which is why 2 is better than 3 in my opinion.)

Atmosphere: 1>3>2

n overhaul Unfortunately, Fear 3 is not as good as Fear 1 and 2, but it's not boring to play if you want to learn what's going on in the story.

One last note is that the DLC of Fear 1 (Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate) is not canon in the story."
76561198077096264,1688688033,True,"It's good and still holds up...ish.
It shows its age, and there are many games that do what it does better but even so it's a fairly good time still.
That said, the levels get a bit repetitive (the three settings being office/lab/industrial) and the enemy variety is almost just 'soldier guy'
It's primarily an action game, horror comes very much secondary and is a bit lacklustre.
The ending is almost great, and would make it a great payoff but is far too short

76561198259312121,1688464268,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of my favourite games of all time. A perfect mix of horror, action gameplay, enemy participation in said gameplay and an overall unique feel found nowhere else.

The gameplay is quite straight forward - walk, jump, melee, melee in air (jump kick - very cool), change weapons and shoot. What makes F.E.A.R. speacial however is the slow motion mode that makes everything in the game ten times more interesting when activated. Inspired by Hong Kong action movies, where in the most intense action scenes the frame rate goes into slow motion and the environmental destruction gets turned up to eleven, F.E.A.R. gives the control of time itself to the player. And it's amazing. Even though it would feel great mowing down legions of enemies in reflex mode (that's what the slow motion ability is called), it simply wouldn't feel rewarding and after awhile it would get really stale. I'm happy to announce that F.E.A.R. never gets stale in the gameplay department. Why? Because the AI of the enemies is incredibly complex and behaves like a coordinated squad flanking you from all the sides, trying to avoid close combat, changing cover frequently and chatting to each other on the comms. I have to say this very plainly - nowhere, and I really mean NOWHERE else, in any other game, can you find enemy AI so complex and so intertwined into the level design as in F.E.A.R. It's almost pathetic that even though games look better and better every year, demanding ever higher PC specs, the enemy AI and environmental interaction peaked in the early 2000s.

It might come off as a surprise, but mainly thanks to games such as Left 4 Dead, Portal and CS:GO still being popular and running on Valve's ancient Source engine, the look of F.E.A.R. looks very familiar, dare I say, quite endearing and pleasant. The game still looks amazing eighteen years after its release even though the models and textures could be considered low poly for today's standards. That is mainly due to the dynamic lighting and shadows but also due to the ammount of environmental detail. F.E.A.R. takes mostly place in office buidings and offices so the setting gets repetetive very quickly but even though the locations feel very samey, the game simply has this polished look that makes the places feel lived in and therefore even more immersive. Probably the factor working the best in tandom with the level of detail is the environmental interaction. The reflex mode wouldn't have been nearly as impactful if the destruction you could cause wasn't as great of a spectacle as it is. Debris flying around, printers spitting paper everywhere, furniture cracking and glass shattering into hundreds of pieces - so much love has been put into this part of the game and it truly shows.

The story is quite simple but exactly what the game needed. Everything gets put in place perfectly for you to get the most out of it. Even the horror elements make sense in the F.E.A.R. universe and feel eery (especially on the first playthrough) when encountering them. Most of the horror sections are very well made, mainly building up tension not necessarily trying to scare you but there are some outliers. I always hated jumpscares and even though I love F.E.A.R., the jumpscares, though admittedly there are no too many of them, are probably the worst part of the entire game. Some better, some worse, but as it is the case with any jumpscare, it just isn't scary - it startles you and invokes your inner instinct to recoil in your chair. It's the cheapest way to get ""scared"".

F.E.A.R. holds a special place in my heart. It truly is something special that I wish everyone could experience. Its a masterpiece. It's so good that no other game in the franchise could top it or at least match it. That is perhaps why they bundled all of the other F.E.A.R. games together to boost their sales figures. Unfortunately, you cannot just buy F.E.A.R. and play it, you have to purchase it throught the bundle on steam. Under normal circumstances I would have been grateful that I can buy more games for the price of one but most of the other games are not worth your time. I have to recommend you buy the bundle because this game is worth the extra price, although beware that rest of the bundle (mainly the 2nd and 3rd game, not necassarily the expansions) is a bit of a waste."

76561198406458979,1688346052,False,"Fantastic atmosphere and map design, but horrible gameplay. Its incredibly repetitive, and absolutely no change in pace whatsoever. The gameplay cycle follows:
meet up with the two same people that you assume are important --> fight bad guys alone for 30 minutes --> repeat.

I did that for 3 hours and realized there was no story to follow and can just finally move onto the next game.

There were always loads medkits and armor laying around where there was no need for it, but when I REALLY needed them, no where to be found. 
Some of the guns were god awful, mostly the speargun thing. 
Around the 3 hour mark, you find a new gun on the roof of Armachan, but the new enemies you fight are just carrying every gun BUT the new one you just found, so you get to use it for a total of 5 seconds before it runs out of ammo and shocker, these guns aren't found anytime after that.

76561198031619767,1688338858,True,"This game is pretty much entirely carried by its gunplay and AI. The story is very bland and predictable (I also cant even remember 90% of the casts names and I just finished it yesterday), the environments are repetitive for most of the game, the horror is a complete joke I never once get scared, and the movement feels very stiff and slow, dragging out the slow walking sections.

But, oh boy does the good REALLY shine here. It doesn't matter that you're fighting the same enemies with same weapons for the entirety of the game, because the weapons feel amazing in combination with the bullet time, and the AI feels like a real puzzle to crack at times. You really got to play smart but aggressive in this game or the AI will corner you in and punish you hard. This combined with generally good arena design, despite the repetitive enviornments makes it a blast to play through. Not once did the core gameplay get old to me, its what kept me going despite everything else that felt so bland. 

While it's not a top 5 shooter for me, I can easily see why it is for a lot of people and I could easily reccomend it. It's not quite what I really love in a shooter but its so good at what it sets out to do in its gameplay.

76561199174905759,1688310679,True,"Step into the shoes of the Point Man and brace yourself for a nerve-wracking experience in F.E.A.R. This first-person shooter delivers a masterclass in combining heart-pounding action with spine-chilling horror, making it an unforgettable gaming experience.

The game effortlessly blends supernatural horror elements with intense gunplay, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout. The haunting visuals, atmospheric sound design, and clever use of lighting create a sense of dread that lingers with every step you take.

What truly sets F.E.A.R. apart is its intelligent AI. Prepare to face enemies who are not only formidable but also remarkably adaptive. They'll take cover, flank you, and even coordinate their attacks, making every encounter a thrilling battle for survival. The game's signature slow-motion mechanic, known as ""reflex mode,"" allows you to react with lightning speed, adding a cinematic flair to the heart-pounding action.

The story of F.E.A.R. is a captivating web of mystery and psychological twists. As you delve deeper into the dark secrets surrounding the enigmatic Alma, you'll uncover a narrative that will keep you guessing until the very end. Supported by well-developed characters and top-notch voice acting, the game's storyline pulls you in and refuses to let go.

F.E.A.R. is a triumph in the horror and shooter genres, delivering a gameplay experience that remains thrilling and memorable even years after its release. Its gripping atmosphere, intelligent AI, and engrossing narrative combine to create a rollercoaster ride of adrenaline-pumping excitement. If you're looking for a game that will keep you on the edge of your seat, F.E.A.R. is an absolute must-play. Just remember to keep your wits about you because in F.E.A.R., danger lurks around every corner, and your nerves will be put to the ultimate test."
76561198338942446,1688309324,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of the best shooters and worst horror games I have ever played.

The combat is simply awesome, the weapons all feel great as enemies react to every shot that hits them, the sounds are awesome, the illusion of coordinated enemies nearly complete, the bullet time at the player's disposal providing a way to dominate them, the chaos as sparks and debris flies around and dust fills the air, as enemies yell commands or scream in pain, the clinking of empty casings on the ground, the explosions of grenades literally warping their surroundings and sending chunks of bodies flying, filling the player's blood with copious amounts of adrenaline... Awesome, the combat in this game is simply awesome and for me personally, it is definitely one of the contenders for the spot of best first person shooter.

The game is also incredibly atmospheric with very advanced lighting engine that holds up even today, providing copious amounts of tension and dread as the player traverses the seemingly labyrinthine industrial buildings, offices of a corporate skyscraper or decaying abandoned town falling to ruin.

Unfortunately, though, it is not all good. The horror elements are nearly entirely composed of jumpscares, and often very bad ones at that. The choice of environments lends itself well into the illusion of AI cleverness and to the atmosphere, but they are also incredibly cramped and bland with very little variety. A few of the guns appear too late into the game, giving the player quite limited time with them. Enemy roster is at least 90% composed of a variation on ""basic grunt"" and only has one type of miniboss. And finally, the story is rather ""mid"", as the kids say nowadays, with rather predictable twists and an ending as cliche as it is unsatisfactory.

Still, the gameplay is simply so good that it more than makes up for all of the game's shortcomings and F.E.A.R. is definitely something you will want to experience."

Back when this game came out, I kind of dismissed it as nothing but a first-person shooter with a [b]Max Payne[/b] “Bullet Time” gimmick and I didn’t appreciate how they blatantly ripped off the character concept of Sadako from The Ring to use at the core of their horror theme. 

Returning to it now, almost 20 years later, I have to say I'm sad I dismissed the game, because if I hadn’t, it would probably have been one of my favorite shooters of all time. 

This is a great game. It’s so tense and atmospheric, the AI is fun and competent, and it feels nice to creep around and pick enemies off one by one while slowing down time. It holds up remarkably well, and at the time of this review, doesn’t require any fan patches to get to work properly.  

I love how they reward early exploration with permanent upgrades, as this made me feel the need to explore everything, further increasing the tension. It made me go down ominous hallways and areas that I wouldn’t have visited otherwise. 

There were a few things I didn’t enjoy. I didn’t like how they jump right into the horror aspect of the game without any buildup at all. As the game progressed, it got better, but it didn’t do anything for me at first. I also didn’t enjoy how enemies took quite a few headshots to take out. Sure, they’re wearing armor, but it felt a bit bullet spongey. There’s also very little enemy variety throughout the whole game, and you’re spending most of the time in very similar looking locations. 

All things considered, these felt like very minor issues, and I still warmly recommend this game."

F.E.A.R. is a first-person shooter game that combines horror elements with intense action sequences. The game follows the story of a special forces team sent to stop a rogue military commander who has gained control of a battalion of telepathically controlled soldiers. While it seems simple enough on the surface and almost generic in some ways, the way that it is packaged produces an end result which is anything but.

F.E.A.R. is known for its atmospheric and immersive gameplay, as well as its use of slow-motion effects, intelligent AI and bullet time usage. While it is not the first game to use any of these elements, the blend of the components and the execution thereof is what sets it apart (and continues to do so to this day). You play as the ""point man"", a super (and super silent) special operative tasked to track down a rogue element. What starts off as a simple mission of contain/extract/neutralise quickly unravels as shit gets real, and you find yourself having disturbing visions, hallucinating and having constant ""WTF"" moments while you play.

As an FPS, it is no surprise that the majority of the combat in F.E.A.R. revolves around shooting guns. The AI in the game, primarily enemy soldiers, are particularly intelligent, especially in their movements and general awareness. As an example, if you are not sparing with your use of the flashlight, they will notice it and come to investigate. If you engage the enemy, they will move to flank you quickly (there were quite a few times where I thought to funnel them in and draw them towards me, only to have some of the enemy soldiers circle around and hit me from the back). The need to choose your battles must be balanced with aggression: you cannot rush in blindly either (you can do so briefly, while you have your ""bullet time"" active) and positioning is key as well to avoid being overwhelmed, especially on higher difficulties. Pro tip: lean around cover, aim for the head = profit.

The difference maker however is Alma: the little girl in the red dress who randomly appears throughout your playthrough, and does not seem to be very happy about something. What starts out as an innocuous sighting and a general ""that's weird"" quickly becomes something far more creepy, as her role and past is revealed as you make your way through the campaign. F.E.A.R. does not take the same approach as Doom 3: while there are a handful of jump scares (you will almost certainly be caught out a few times), the biggest part of the atmosphere, and perhaps the biggest part of the success of the game, is how unnerving it is. You will have moments of combat, moments of quiet, moments of trepidation, as you progress. The campaign is masterfully paced and it is often the silence, and the constant building of pressure and tension, which does you in. A lot of things are ""unexplained"" in the sense that they don't make ANY sense - but as a package the elements combine masterfully.

[b]NOTE:[/b] The expansions (Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate) are no longer considered canon (if that sort of thing matters to you), but they deserve to be played regardless.

There is little to criticise in the game, as it has aged quite well. The most often heard complaint of F.E.A.R. being an ""office simulator"" does still apply, as the majority of the original game does seem to take place in one office block/building after another (this is less of an issue in the expansions). There are still some annoying issues, particularly if you disable Vsync or run at high refresh rates, but nothing that cannot be overcome or resolved/prevented. If you run into performance problems, specifically random FPS drops to the point of being almost unplayable, you can use the below guide to help (I did this preemptively before I began my playthrough, so never had issues)(all credit to OP):
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=759431266
For other suggestions or tips, the PCGamingWiki page ([url]https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/F.E.A.R.[/url] has some tweaks which may improve the experience. Both links are applicable to both expansions as well.

If you are jumpy, have a weak heart or are susceptible to scares, it may be best to avoid F.E.A.R. and its expansions. For the rest... this is a game which needs to be experienced.

Played on Windows 11 Pro x64 without any issues. You may need to disable joysticks and movies in the Config app in order to get the game to work properly (this also needs to be done separately for each expansion)."
76561198847240481,1688097467,False,"The vast majority of the game is good, but the last 2 missions are so bad it ruined the game for me. I haven't looked it up, but it really seems like they either ran out of time or money. 

The enemy AI is lauded nearly universally, and I can kind of get it. But I felt very whelmed when I actually started playing. I thought they were supposed to be smarter than this. Not to worry though, the last 2 missions completely throw away all of the good combat as well. Instead of interesting arenas with enemies that are at least competent, you just fight rooms full of grenade-spamming soldiers, robots that do way too much damage and take way too much damage to destroy, and hordes of ghosts that sometimes automatically trigger slow-mo and sometimes don't. Unless you're really invested in the story, just stop playing once you complete Interval 9. You've already seen everything that the game has to offer you, and you'll avoid the sour taste that I now have in my mouth because of how atrocious the last couple levels are. 

Developers need to understand that what they absolutely need to land are the beginning and the ending of a game. There can be a disappointing section in the middle, but you cannot just not make the ending of the game until the end of the development cycle. It flopped so hard. 

If those levels didn't exist, solid 8/10 game. With those levels in mind, 4/10. 

If you have trouble running it, set it to windows 7 pack 2 or windows xp pack 3 compatibility mode, and check the box for 'disable fullscreen optimizations'. To do this, you find the game's .exe in its folder > right click > properties > compatibility."

Still has some bugs here and there, but it should run fine on modern PCs, so if you never played this, I highly recommend trying.

How does a game from 2005 has actually smart enemies that stay in cover and hold angles instead of running to their death, calling out your position, actively trying to flank you and even knowing when to advance or rush in? I have no idea how it isn't a modern standard in FPS. On Extreme difficulty, it's probably the closest you'll get to feeling like having to outsmart your enemies in a single player shooter game. The bullet time mechanic also feels great and adds a lot to the spectacle without being too overpowered.

the levels are always the perfect length with great pacing, the combat encounters are one of the best because the enemies and level designs are perfectly built for each other, their placements are great and they interact with the environment in unique ways.

the players arsenal and combat abilities fit this game perfectly, the weapons are all useful in different ways, the SLOW MOTION feels amazing to use and makes you feel pretty bad-ass, the karate melee attacks are pretty cool too.

its visuals still stand up to this day, all because of the dynamic lighting, its something you should see for yourself, and you cant forget its creepy atmosphere and mood.

76561198219188221,1686088061,True,"[h1] F.E.A.R. - A Blast From the Past [/h1]

I've been aware of this game since I was 5 or 6 but I never played it due to my fear of horror games. I remember watching my uncle play F.E.A.R. and the the apparition of a creepy little girl was etched in my memory forever. Now, after 16 or maybe 17 years, I finally got my hands on this thrilling title that many consider iconic and a game way ahead of this time.


After Doom Eternal, this probably is the best FPS game that I played in recent years, and maybe even in top 3 overall. To be honest I don't play that much FPS games (not involving multiplayer) because I don't consider it a really captivating genre. F.E.A.R. however is a [i]HORROR[/i] FPS and that's probably why I had more fun. I can say with certainty that this game aged like fine wine and it also was ahead of its time when it came out. 

Gameplay is really good if you are into dynamic and explosive gunfights - because this game is all about that. The creators were inspired by John Woo movies, which explains a lot when you see the gunfights - there will be a bunch of things flying around with every hit that you land. Combine that with the bullet-action power that you can use and you'll get the most chaotic encounters ever. And on top of that, you can also use a variety of ""martial-arts"" melee hits. With all that said, you can create a real Matrix-esque fight setting.

The main thing that this game is praised for is the AI of the enemies. Although the AI is good, it's not really godlike as people claim; it's the fact that the soldier you encounter call out your position and they always work together to hunt you down. You can hear them talking with each other whenever you hide behind a different object, saying things like ""Behind the chair"", ""Behind the cubicle"", ""Behind the sofa"" and many more. Also they will jump through windows or crawl underneath tight spaces to try to close in on you, which I found really well done.
 
Graphics are great honestly, I can't get my head around that the game was released 18 years ago.  From the starting cutscene in this game you'll notice how nice this game looks considering it was released way back in 2005.  The dynamic lightning was brilliantly done, and it added so much to the horror factor if you ask me. The textures also look really nice. 

The story is good, maybe there could be some better things done in the narrative, but it still does its job. 

Now, the best part of the game for me was the horror part. Mainly because it's not just ordinary horror, but it also has psychological elements. The beauty of F.E.A.R. is in the build-up and the suspense. As you progress and learn more about the story, so will the horror elements become stronger. There will be times when you are walking through long hallways and expect a jumpscare, but nothing will happen. I was actually scared or creeped out many times and I was on my tip-toes quite often. That being said, the overall horror ambience was top-notch.

The con is that, as in many FPS games, the gunfight can become repetitive. Also, there aren't that many different enemies that you can fight - 90% of the time you will be fighting the same replica soldiers, and occasionally the armored soldiers which are harder to kill. The other con is that basically the whole game you will be in an enclosed environment, most notably hallways and offices, so that can become repetitive too. 


And after all, considering the cons that I said,  F.E.A.R. is a great game. I'm all about the ambience and general atmosphere in pretty much all games that I play, and those were done brilliantly. Final verdict - 9/10 and highly recommended. 

I also recommend playing the Extraction Point DLC. Although it's not considered canon, it was a really nice playthrough. It focused on the good parts of the main game and improved the bad parts. There are also new weapons that you can use and more new enemies that you can encounter."

76561198315833807,1685462005,True,"Important notes before I start the review: If you’re experiencing severe frame rate drops, try installing this fix: https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/789-directinput-fps-fix/ . If you’re playing on a low-end PC, you should go into the advanced computer and video card options and turn down the settings such as world detail, corpse detail, texture resolution, etc. I would also suggest lowering the resolution (I lowered it to 1600x900 for the DLCs and had a great experience). If you’re seeing odd outline flashes (to this day I don’t know the proper name for this bizarre problem), turn FSAA off, then right-click the game in your Steam library, then select “Properties” and type in “+windowed 1 +ScreenWidth 1600 +ScreenHeight 900” as the launch options (without the quotation marks. Also, you can enter whatever resolution you want, I just used 1600x900 as an example). Then use the Borderless Gaming tool (link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/borderless-gaming.mirror/ ). That's all, let's begin! 

When buying F.E.A.R. on Steam, you’re getting the game with its two DLCs in a bundle. I’ll be reviewing the base game and the DLCs each in their own separate sections, then I’ll talk about the cons and give an overall final verdict.

F.E.A.R.
This is a horror first-person shooter where you play as the Point Man, an operative who is part of an elite task force called First Encounter Assault Recon (F.E.A.R.). A psychic commander by the name of Paxton Fettel has gone rogue and taken full command of an army of cloned super-soldiers called Replicas. As the Point Man, you must hunt him down while fighting scores of his minions. You also occasionally experience strange hallucinations and discover more about Fettel, the corporation responsible for him and the Replicas, as well as a mysterious little girl in a red dress. Sound interesting? Then read on. 

An aspect of F.E.A.R. that is worthy of high praise would have to be the gameplay. The devs clearly made sure the combat was satisfying and the overall movement felt great, and they absolutely succeeded. The amount of gore in this game is wonderful; you’ll see enemies get dismembered, turned into a fine red mist, or even reduced to nothing but their skeletons. This helped make the combat feel really fun and brutal. There’s a “Slow-Mo” mechanic, which, as the name implies, slows down time, giving you a chance to gain the upper hand in desperate situations while providing some additional satisfaction to the already enjoyable violence. While in Slow-Mo, you can admire enemies dying in various gruesome ways in a slowed-down spectacle of slaughter. You can also make it easier to aim more accurately, which is very useful when you’re in an area with lots of enemies at long ranges that would otherwise be very difficult to hit in a chaotic combat situation. There are even reflex boosters scattered throughout the game that will increase your Slow-Mo, so that’s nice (there are health boosters too). The movement feels just right, it’s neither too rigid nor too loose. You can even do a slide and bicycle kick. The game offers a splendid selection of weapons to kill your foes with. You have the basics like a handgun, submachinegun, and assault rifle, but eventually you reach more unique weapons like a particle gun that shoots beams of energy powerful enough to strip all the flesh off your enemies’ bones, a rocket launcher that shoots three rockets at a time, a nail gun that fires steel stakes you can impale and even pin enemies to walls with, etc. I should definitely point out how insanely good the shotgun is since it’s pretty much perfect: short reload times, powerful punchy shots, and lots of visceral detail from enemies you use it against. You get plenty of ammo for it too, which will almost guarantee that it’s a weapon you’ll keep for most of the game.

Here, I’d like to touch on the enemies. For starters, their AI is fantastic. They will hold defensive positions, try to flank you, throw grenades to get you out into the open, climb through broken windows, etc. The Replicas feel like an actual intelligent threat rather than mindless drones (even though that’s technically what they are). They can even detect your flashlight and become alerted to your presence by it. The variety of Replicas is quite decent, with different strengths, weaknesses, preferred weapons, and distinct visual designs. Two great examples are the stealth troopers, who can turn invisible and perform amazing acrobatics and the REV-6 powered armour troops, which are not only formidable but also boast excellent firepower. Another thing I like about the enemies is their voice lines, which may seem like a minor thing, but hearing them aggressively cuss, talk to each other, and yell in pain when dying really does add a nice touch to the already brilliant combat. 

In terms of atmosphere and narrative, I’d say the game holds up pretty well. I found many of the environments to be really atmospheric and eerie, which is ideal for a horror game. The sound design, voice acting, and music is generally well made. I especially liked the tense tracks that would play during combat. The game’s story isn’t bad either; it’s quite unique and interesting, combining paranormal activity with sci-fi militaristic action. Usually it’s aliens or zombies, but here? Something else entirely. 

F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point
This DLC takes place right after the events of the first game. You need to navigate your way through a ruined city and find the extraction point where you’ll be rescued. I’d say this is a great expansion that, although is identical to the base game in terms of gameplay and visuals, offers enough new things to keep it interesting such as new environments and even some new enemies and new weapons. These weapons are the deployable turret, minigun, and laser carbine, which are all a lot of fun to use. I also liked the new enemies, such as the riot shield Replicas and the REV-8 Leviathans. As I said before, this DLC is pretty much identical to the base game visually and gameplaywise and that includes the enemy AI. Music and sound design are decent. That's about it. 

F.E.A.R.: Perseus Mandate 
This DLC takes place not long after Extraction Point. You aren’t playing as the Point Man this time; instead, you’re a nameless sergeant assigned to a small elite team to retrieve some information regarding something called “Project Perseus”. The game boasts more new environments as well as an entirely new enemy faction known as “Nightcrawlers”, armed with powerful weapons. Speaking of weapons, this expansion brings two new ones: the grenade launcher and advanced assault rifle. Both of these are enjoyable to use and don’t feel unnecessary. Strangely enough, the sergeant character here has the same Slow-Mo ability as the Point Man, which is never explained, but whatever. I guess the devs decided it was too fun to remove, which I understand. There are also bonus missions that add some replay value. Other than that, not much else here is different to the base game or Extraction Point. 

Now I’d like to talk about the negatives. I feel like the horror elements of this game are pretty underwhelming; most of them didn’t frighten me at all, and the occasional moments that DID make me jump a little were basically just cheap jump scares. There are only about 3 paranormal enemy types in total, which I feel is a missed opportunity. The sounds for random objects in the game would sometimes glitch and sound really bizarre. I experienced this same problem in Condemned: Criminal Origins, another Monolith Productions game. I've already mentioned performance issues in 1080p (keep in mind that this game and its DLCs are from 2005-7). I should also mention that the multiplayer mode doesn’t work without a mod.

To conclude, F.E.A.R. and its DLCs are fantastic and definitely worth your time. They’re not perfect, but so what? 

Final verdict: 8.5/10 ""What am I, an I.S lackey?"""
76561197994436631,1685360264,True,"Every once in a while, once in a decade, once in a generation, a good horror game comes out and scares the living hell out of people who play it, impressing the players and certainly the once-young kids that played them for the first time.

76561197970237665,1683906854,True,"TLDR: A decent and challenging fps that holds up even today. I heartily enjoyed it, but I wouldn’t buy it if I were you. 

[b][u]General Thoughts/Overview:[/u][/b]

I can’t tell if FEAR was ever actually [i]meant[/i] to be scary. It got me with a few jump scares here and there, but for the most part I thought it was campy and quite funny. There were some decent sections that felt tense, though, and even though the story was pretty terrible it was good enough and well done enough that it felt like a good fit for the game. 

Story is standard FPS fodder with a horror twist, you play as a member of team sent in to deal with the super scary bad guys after the best of the best already failed. You fight your way through levels of mercs/extremists/terrorists/clones/monsters to the little girl at the centre of the plot. 
FEAR’s main mechanic is the bullet time power you can kick in to slow everything right down and take your shots. Odds are, you’re going to need it. 


[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
[list][*] The biggest draw of this game after so many years, for me, has to be the AI. The badguys in this game are [i]smart[/i]. And for once I don’t mean ‘smart for AI’ or ‘smarter than average’ I meant actually, challengingly, intelligent. They utilise squad tactics, flank, set up positions, are patient, will fall back when threatened, avoid running face first into gunfire, and communicate to the player (and each other) while doing so. They are a pleasure to play against, and can be an actual threat.
[*] The weapons feel nice, with several different guns all of which handle slightly differently, each with their own positive and negatives. Bar the special weapons, which are rare, but a lot of fun to use for a little bit. Disintegrate, explode, electrocute or nail those dudes to the wall with a variety of fun guns. 
[*] The time slowing power feels quite good, and gets boosted over time. The intelligent AI makes it feel required, and super good to use as it can bail you out of situations that would otherwise be quite tight. 
[/list]

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
[list][*] The levels are just poorly designed, being both boring and uninteresting. The game could have been a series of corridors and it would have made no difference at all. 
[*] The secondary weapons felt pointless. The grenades are fled from, the turrets are targets and the proxy mines are shot. Maybe I wasn’t using them correctly, but they felt pointless and uninteresting, especially when compared to the gunplay.  
[*] Game can stutter and crash. Be sure to use the quick save function. Stutters can get you murdered by the AI, and crashes are frustrating but happen if too much is going on. 
[/list]

[b][u]Suggested improvements:[/u][/b]
 [list][*]This game would be amazing if the levels were open. Letting the AI be put to use in trying to flank around in squads or get you at choke points. As well as having multiple different ways to complete objectives via different paths. 
[*] The health and armour system could be improved by making both a little rarer, bringing a little more tension to the fights. I think I only ran out of medkits once in the entire game. 
[/list]


[b][u]Overall Recommendation:[/u][/b]

Overall this game is a great addition to an FPS enjoyer’s library, it’s a classic that holds up today and is enjoyable to play through. Each segment is also fairly short, making the entire experience quite modular and bitesize. 

While it has elements of horror, this game isn’t really for horror fans, who would mostly be disappointed by it.

The biggest issue I can see with this game and its dlc is that it’s stupidly expensive, as it is available as a bundle item only. I have no idea why this has happened, or why but I’m looking forward to playing the next couple and hope the series got even better. I have no doubt that on sale this game holds up its portion of the bundle cost, but would recommend a sale anyway."

76561198068266531,1683476055,True,"F.E.A.R. is a classic shooter game that still holds up to this day. The game's gripping story will keep you engaged from beginning to end. The plot is well-crafted and the pacing is excellent, making it an enjoyable experience from start to finish.

One of the standout features of F.E.A.R. is the enemy AI, which is still impressive by today's standards. The enemies are smart, unpredictable and make combat challenging, ensuring that you'll have to use all of your skills to survive.

While the game may not be as scary as some horror titles, it's still a fun and thrilling ride. The gunplay is excellent, with satisfying weapons and engaging battles that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Additionally, the particle effects are amazing, creating an immersive experience that draws you into the action.

It's worth noting that the game suffers from a few issues on modern hardware, but it's nothing that can't be fixed with some patience. Once you get past the technical hiccups, you'll be rewarded with a fantastic gameplay experience that is well worth your time.

In summary, F.E.A.R. is a classic shooter that still stands the test of time. The story is engaging, the gunplay is excellent, and the enemy AI is impressive. While it may not be the scariest game out there, it's still a thrilling ride that is fun to play. If you're a fan of shooters, F.E.A.R. is definitely worth checking out."

76561199113879893,1683231778,True,"[h1]F.E.A.R is a Masterpiece[/h1]
F.E.A.R manages to mix excellent FPS gameplay and horror elements into something truly unique.  You play as the mute Point Man, and must eliminate a psychic commander of clone troopers.  As you venture further into the game you discover the truth about the commander, Point Man, and a shady companies' unethical past.  The story keeps you invested from beginning to end, even if most of the characters don't get much screen time.  The best is Alma, she is first seen as a small girl with psychic abilities.  Her connection to the commander and Point Man as well as what happened to her, makes her a very sympathetic character.  The rest of the cast plays a smaller role since you are mostly alone and only communicate over radio.
Despite having a good story, F.E.A.R's gameplay is what truly makes it shine.  The enemies AI and the level design come together to make some of the best FPS combat.  The AI isn't stupid like other games, they try to flank you, take cover, and use other tactics.  I was surprised by how they will use the environment to make cover, and react to how you play by repositioning and pushing you as needed.  They can do this because the environment is so well designed.  Each area you encounter the enemy in has multiple places for them to hide and lanes they can use to flank you. These enemies and combat encounters are some of my favorite of all time.
There are some issues with the game that any new player should be aware of.  Since this game is from 2005, graphics can seem dated.  Character models can look a little pointy and backgrounds look less detailed in some areas.  The biggest issue people seem to have is that environments tend to look the same.  A good example is the office you traverse through in the middle of the game.  The offices seem to blend together and all the hallways look similar.  This didn't bother me, because I know offices normally have a very similar layout from room to room, but it is a issue people do have with the game.  
Despite some issues, F.E.A.R is still a excellent game.  The firefights with the enemies are truly special, and the story is engaging and well told.

The A.I. genuinely impresses me every time and is so refreshing compared to modern games. They'll work together, throw grenades to push you out of cover, wait for you to reload or stop peaking, actively flank you, and utilise various pieces of cover to their advantage. It's legitimately fun to fight them, especially given the level layouts, guns, and mechanics available to the player.

As with many older games make sure to make multiple, frequent saves.

76561198324732235,1682356036,True,"This is the only game as well as extraction point that is worth playing. The DLCs are not cannon anyways so the argument that Perseus Mandate is better than Extraction like I saw another review say because of story is literally not viable. Extraction Scales the fights to a crazy degree. For a better review and what made me buy this game is Mandelores game review of FEAR 1 (its old but a good video). In my OPINION the rest of the franchise sucks ass the drew out Alma's story and made changes that fundamentally fucked what was good about the first game, in-depth combat against the AI (standoffs, flanking, flushing you out, rushing you when reloading, hitting you at better angles, finding cover when you flank them) as well as simple graphical fluidity since on modern hardware the game runs like butter and the fights are so fucking good. Play the game but i suggest trying to find a key their are plenty of places you can still find one."

76561198068369219,1682147009,True,"After so many years this FPS still stands the test of time. SImplistic gameplay yet a great atmosphere that combined with masterful atmospheric music created a one of a kind game, a true master of the horror genre."

76561198044608253,1681960667,True,"As a fan of horror and first-person shooter games, I was excited to try out F.E.A.R. The game's engaging story and solid combat mechanics did not disappoint. The slow-motion and bullet time mechanics added a level of strategy and intensity to combat that made taking down enemies feel incredibly satisfying.

However, the game did have its drawbacks. The linear level design and repetitive gameplay became predictable and less engaging over time. Additionally, the lack of variety in weapons and enemies made the combat feel stale at times. Despite these flaws, the game's impressive graphics and intense atmosphere kept me hooked.

One of the game's standout features was its horror elements. The game's use of sound effects and jump scares added to the overall sense of unease and terror. The game's villain, Alma, was a memorable and iconic character in the horror genre, with her appearance and behavior adding to the game's horror elements and making her a truly terrifying antagonist. The Alma vision mechanic was a unique feature that added to the game's intrigue and mystery.

Overall, F.E.A.R. is a solid horror-themed shooter game that is worth playing for fans of the genre. While the game has its flaws, the engaging story, solid combat mechanics, and horror elements make for an enjoyable experience.

Annoying things like smoke blocks your vision but not enemies.  I will admit the physX looks good though.   I've never played the 2nd game so i'm hoping after I force myself through this one the 2nd one will have the problems from the first game fixed.

76561198080570470,1681508930,True,"I found this game very fun yet tedious, the levels are all way too similar but luckily this game is short, it only took me around 5 hours to beat on easy (yeah yeah laugh, i'm a casual). Most of the weapons are cool but I found myself sticking to only like 3 or 4 the whole game, and the enemy variety isn't that great either, there's ground troopers, armored ground troopers, mini mechs, flying drones, and specters. The story was pretty simple but got a little confusing towards the end, it never really explains anything unless you go out of your way to get all the collectibles, and the ending felt entirely unsatisfying. I'm gonna quickly rant about the levels a little more. Why is there like 5 chapters of just an office building, all the geometry is the same and it gets grading to look at by the third chapter in the building, gah I couldn't stand those levels.

Despite my gripes, I had a lot of fun with this game and would recommend fans of the fps genre to try it. Strong 6/10"

As someone who played it back in the day, I can attest to its effectiveness in creating a tense and frightening atmosphere. The combination of eerie sound design, creepy visuals, and unpredictable encounters with Alma and the other supernatural enemies keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the game.

One of the standout features of F.E.A.R. is its advanced AI system. Enemies will intelligently flank you, take cover, and use grenades to flush you out. It's impressive how the game's AI can still provide a challenging experience even by today's standards.

The gunplay in F.E.A.R. is satisfying and smooth. Each weapon feels unique, and the game encourages experimentation to find your favorite loadout. The slow-motion mechanic adds a layer of strategy to the combat, allowing you to take out multiple enemies with precision shots.

The storyline in F.E.A.R. is engaging, with a mysterious and complex plot that slowly unfolds over the course of the game. The various plot twists and revelations keep you invested in the narrative until the very end.

Overall, F.E.A.R. is a fantastic game that successfully blends horror, action, and story elements to create an unforgettable experience. Its advanced AI, satisfying gunplay, and engaging plot make it a must-play for any fans of the genre."

Nice balance between action, story and spooky elements.
AI still looks very cool with all things your enemies can do.
Visuals are also still nice, although of course a bit dated.
Default controls are a bit strange, so most of players will change them :D
So overall, it is a solid FPS game that still has some interesting things to show you, I liked it.

Regarding DLCs:

- Extraction point is kinda bad. Feels more like a mod for the most parts of it. Too much shooting and shooting with almost no story bits. It becomes interesting only at the end, like a level or two. Then DLC is over. Also, it has some serious performance problems, huge frame drops for no reason. I felt like I am a kid again and playing this on old PC. Because in some sequences I had 15-20 frames. Very nice during fights indeed :D

- Perseus Mandate is very good. It is on par with the main game. Tons of story bits and scripted scenes. Also performance is much better (just like in main game), I had only once some frame drops.

To sum up:
- FEAR is great, liked it.
- Extraction Point has almost no point to play for me, 80% of it is just action without real story bits.
- Perseus Mandate is a great addon.
- You can play FEAR and Perseus Mandate and just read/watch Extraction Point's story, saving some time :)"

76561198203278442,1680762824,True,"F.E.A.R is an amazing game and would recommend to anyone who loves horror and/or first person shooters. With outstanding visuals and AI, It makes every gunfight unique and honestly makes you feel like you're in an action movie. You can reload a save before the same gunfight 10 times and it will be different every time. However there's flaws that you're going to need to address before playing. 

1. the price
- Do not pay $55 for a 20 year old game even if it comes with all its DLC's. i would recommend a steam key or a free download lmao

2. the frame rate
- Your Pc is going to most likely be too powerful for the game so even on the most maximum settings you'll cap off the frame rate at 20 or something similar. I would recommend downloading a community patch: ""direct input fps fix"" for F.E.A.R. It works for the main game and DLC's.

Other than that I would recommend you play the game"

76561199036837091,1680645023,True,Horror fps at its finest
76561198260471793,1680604873,True,"I first played FEAR as a kid. I return to it every couple of years, having finally bought it on Steam for like $2 I decided to give it another go. It's still just as amazing as I remember it being. The game manages to make it's mundane setting of warehouses and offices seem interesting and uncanny. It's graphics still hold up really well, being carried by the lighting. The destructible environments combined with the particle effects make this game still a wonder to behold.

But what is the best thing about this game? The silence. There's no fluff. You don't have to sit through like two hours of modern video game cutscenes (something Sony is heavily guilty of). Music is used sparingly, only during harder encounters and boss battles. No stupid oneliners, no useless monologues by your protagonist. The only time the silence is broken is when something that's worthy of your attention is happening - either the beautiful symphony of guns being shot, the game's plenty horror sections or the multiple audiologs (phone calls in this case) giving more context to the story.

FEAR manages to be both terrifying (with the exception of a few cheap jumpscares which are supposed to relieve tension, the psychological horror elements are engaging and add a creepy undertone to the whole game) and an insane powertrip - you will feel rewarded after every encounter, especially on the highest difficulty. FEAR isn't afraid to be a difficult game, something that's quite lacking in today's releases (with the exception of Fromsoft games and of course, indie). 

Easily, the best part of this game is the AI. It's probably the best AI we've ever seen in video game history (which is quite sad, since it's an 18 year old game by now). It's coded well, interacts with both the environment (using makeshift cover, sliding under obstacles, trying to flank you from different directions at once) and with each other (communicating through really charming voiceacting, often annoyed towards each other, being scared when the battle isn't going in their favor, going completely silent when there's only one remaining). It feels like you're playing against actual thinking opponents, kind of like a multiplayer game. I've never witnessed a shooter nail the combat as FEAR. It's like the level designer and the AI developer were working in the same room.

There'll never be a game like FEAR. Maybe Trepang2 will pick up the torch, but the game feels like it wants to beat you over the head with how 'cool' and 'extreme' it is. The movement especially doesn't feel as smooth as in FEAR. Time will tell, maybe it will be a worthy spiritual successor. For now, I highly recommend the original FEAR, and the expansion ""Extraction Point"". You can find both for cheap during any steam sale or on third party resellers in a pack (Perseus Mandate is garbage, don't even bother playing it or the sequels - they're both very very mediocre, and suck ass compared to the original). Just like Dead Space, FEAR doesn't need a remake (unlike Dead Space, it's textures didn't age badly), and hopefully it doesn't get picked up by some greedy publishers, because it would probably get destroyed by modern game design philosophies.

Oh yeah, and it has a few turret sections, no quicktimeevents though. 10/10"

Rabbit's Respawn videos will sell you on it if you're unsure (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlgsmZHVXt4 for showcasing slowdown + particle effects, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91fcS6QHfo4 for replay value)

The static warning sound that plays right before anything scary happens reduces fear factor, but it's probable that you will be genuinely spooked at least once. In both horror and fps respects, it was ahead of its time as a PC game.

Get it as a single title if you can; being forced to pay more to play the only good game in the pack is pretty bullshit."

The bullet-time is fabulously fun and well done. The guns each play unique roles and some of them are straight up brutal. I really like how well they integrated the horror aspect of this, too, it plunges you into an enveloping atmosphere. The story is good, better here than the other games, but not front and center; I like it. I highly recommend this game!"
76561198277220419,1679669158,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of those games I only got to play a few hours of but never completed as a child...my Uncle introduced me to this game and he wasn't a big fan of horror so he hated this and returned it immediately. So I never got the chance to play through this entire game...but was scared S#!tless of Alma as a child, because of how horrifying your encounters with her are. I am glad I picked up a copy of this, because it's genuinely good and it fills that spot in my heart for games like Doom 3, Dead Space, and Resident Evil. Hell it even has that awesome Max-Payne vibe with the slow-mo Gun-fu ability (YOU WILL NEED TO USE) that your character has. It's honestly quite shocking how good the A.I. is in relation to modern day gaming and makes me slightly upset modern day game developers just make a lot of garbage and haven't pushed these concepts further with the incredible technological advances we have now. 

The A.I. is ACTUALLY dynamic, and will react to how you play. What this means is that each encounter with the main enemy force will never feel scripted or ""the same"" on any new play-through that you make (outside of like maybe 2 or 3 scripted events I believe, this holds true for almost all of the encounters). A.I. will always find ways to flank you while the other teammates aggro you and distract you. They will rush to take cover if they are out in the open when you get the drop on them. If you're holed up in an advantageous spot and winning the firefight, they will toss a grenade in that spot you hunkered down in, and force you to reposition...I even had jump scare-like moments from the A.I. because I thought I had won the fight, dropped my guard completely, and automatically went into ""loot goblin mode"" for supplies, power weapons, and ammo.... only to find 1 or 2 of them patiently waiting to ambush me like a cat hunting a mouse. I even had 1 of them jump out like a f***ing maniac and charge me, which resulted in me screaming for my life while my IRL roomies must have thought I was actually being murdered. You will also hear the enemy communicating with where they think you are and will investigate sound sources you make. A few good examples would be if you are deliberately being too loud and running around, it will alert them and they will investigate. If you kill one of their teammates in a stealthy fashion they will walk over to investigate their buddies ""server disconnect from life"". They even remember your last location where they spotted you and will stay in an ""alerted"" status while looking for where you ran off to. At one point I was so impressed because I forgot to turn off my flashlight and got spotted and forced into a tense firefight that left me in ""shock and awe"" because I wasn't expecting them to take my flashlight into consideration... and it made them the enemies feel much ""smarter"" and more ""human"" because of that interaction. 

The Devs really did understand the assignment with the player & enemy interactions, and sculpted the A.I. to react in believe-able ways to what you do. I even remember one of the firefights ending with one of the enemies fearing for his life because I just wiped out all of his teammates and he was making a comment on that interaction. I could go on and on about this for awhile because it is truly the catalyst for a lot of those new indie games being created today, you know, the ones that have that super stylized MAX-PAYNE-F.E.A.R.-Ultra Slow-Mo-John Wick-GunFu-type shooting gallery's that are always a ton of fun to boot up and play. For a game made in the early 2000's it does make you feel like you are in that universe. Even though the environments do sort of become a little stale and same-y, the firefights and paranormal events that happen keep you engaged and entertained throughout. It's not so much a ""BOO"" jump-scare type of horror game. It's more like Japanese style horror where it's psychological and happens to make you always at the edge of your seat and uncomfortably stressed/anxious of what will happen next. This is the reason why I love developers like Bungie, because they make sure when the player is going through that interaction, or exploring the universe they created, you get rewarded with subtle environmental story telling that helps to make this world a bit more believable. I also think doing this helps keep the player more invested and engaged in the story. 

Everything from the soundtrack down to the environment and your interactions with these enemies and paranormal events elevate your experience. Especially when you realize halfway through (I did at least) that the biggest enemy that you are fighting is the actual OST itself. The person who decided to create the soundtrack for this game genuinely hit the nail on the head. It's probably one of the most interesting takes on a Soundtrack where it's more atonal in nature and isn't really melodic or has a huge band or orchestra driving the music and atmosphere like Halo's soundtrack (which is very mysterious, epic, and ancient sounding)...but used more as a narrative device, to accentuate events that occur, but in such a unique way.  It does this incredible job of creating an ambient effect which ultimately oozes more atmosphere into the game. I feel at times this makes the OST feel like it's a ""living & breathing entity"". Especially because you will be moving throughout the level and slowly start to feel a lot more tension pulling at your gut, stress invading your decision making, and fear entering your mind because you're worried whether or not you'll survive this next encounter... The way the soundtrack was designed and implemented into the gameplay during each sequence, is nothing short but a stroke of ambitious brilliance. The stress and tension I felt from the horror was half-the video game developers being cheeky and brilliant, and the other half being the actual audio engineer that made the OST to F.E.A.R. I was always constantly at the edge of my seat for what the next event would be...This is an accomplishment in itself because to be scared from a sound track sounds silly I know...but to realize that it had that much pull on my encounters was nothing short of brilliant. This truly cemented this game as a high recommendation on my list because it really is the ""whole package"". ESPECIALLY for a game that came out over 2 decades ago. You can definitely see why a game like this set the standard and precedent for shooters in the industry at that time and even moving forward. 

Please give this game a shot if you are interested in fun firefights, environmental story telling, and Japanese style Psychological-Horror. It is truly a lot of fun and is a unique take on an over-saturated genre gaming. You will not really experience something like this anywhere else. I can't say about the other games in the series (yet)...but I can at least confidently say it's a buy and play from me (if you can wait get it on sale though because it's insanely expensive for a singleplayer only game). 

EDIT: THIS GAME IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED BY THE DEVS AND REQUIRES ROUGHLY 15 MINUTES OF GOOGLING TO FIX TECHNICAL ISSUES BEFORE PLAYING ON MODERN RIGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Found out how to delete the backup you can download a program called shredder it'll delete the backup folder with FEAR in it. Just make sure to remove any backups you want first.

And yea games really cool, you got some good weapons, and you can slow motion time which results in some pretty cool shootouts. 
Well after beating FEAR and the 2 expansions I gotta say this is one of the best tactical shooting games I've played. I liked the campaign even more than the COD franchise and other series. Still hard to compare this to classics like doom, chasm, turok, duke, and many other titles I greatly respect but that's because this is completely different. This isn't shooting monsters in real time. This is a war against clones with tactics and realistic behavior. They don't just rush in to kill, they scream, yell, give orders, tell each other to shut the f up, and even tell each other when they see your flashlight. These guys don't want to die, but at the same time are utterly fearless. They don't just run away, they don't back down, and on harder difficulties they will surprise you. Take out the whole squad, make a save just in case, have full health, and then all of a sudden a grenade is dropped in front of you silently with no warning at all by the last replicant. That is how smart these guys are, they don't just keep rushing and yelling at you, when you are winning is when they get worse, when they quiet down and get unpredictable. And that's just the squad guys, there's a very complex story here, that I don't want to go into cause of spoilers but it involves telepathy as well as spiritual phenomena and genetics gone out of control. Also focuses on the danger of unregulated military complexes,  its a great story and at first I wasn't convinced this would be anything but a good shooter. But I love the storyline. This also has tons of jump scares so be ready for that, depending on what scares you tho you'll either jump or laugh, me I kinda laugh but the spiritual stuff is well done.

This is a shooter classic and way better than I expected, and I expected it to be awesome but it was actually more than that. Also as lethal as the replicants are, the slow motion effect gives you a major advantage most real time shooters don't. And its a lot of fun and really shows off how well done this games physics are..
Highly recommend it to any shooter fans and I would love to see a FEAR4 and a remaster for this one with both expansions and extra modes. Highly recommend it to horror and shooter fans."

76561198008914127,1679159792,False,"For full disclosure I have to confess that I only just played this for the first time as I missed it when it originally came out. It is quite possible that in its day it was new and innovative and certainly I've heard good things about its sequel and I'm going to play that next.

The plus points are that there are a number of weapons, the story is interesting with a mix of flashbacks/hallucinations, and it is atmospheric in places.

However, the gameplay becomes very repetitive very quickly with enemies generally doing the same thing (although I believe the AI was innovative in its day) and the lack of weapon choices often means you're trying your best to conserve ammo in a game which isn't really designed for that (particularly as health kits seem to be in almost inexhaustible supply).

I also found that the story was quite difficult to follow with very few clues as to what was actually going on. I know that there are now plenty of forums out there to explain and so on, but for the most part it didn't feel suspenseful as if they were gradually feeding me info, it felt like I largely had no real clue of motivation or what was happening. I largely remained baffled as to who the people were who I was shooting at and why I should hate them.

Like I said, it's possible that it has now been copied so many times and elaborated upon so many times that none of this matters now, but I'm not sure it stands up as a particularly great game."

Barely any enemy variety. Most weapons sound pretty good and there's some unique ones sprinkled throughout the game + DLC. Fighting hordes of enemies becomes very tedious after a few hours. Some physics elements like enemy ragdolls and environmental damage is really nicely done.

The gameplay in the DLC is pretty much the same. The locations are very same-y and similar to ones in the base game. Enemies are copy paste. The game seems to have been inspired by half-life. A lot of the locations are similar."

This game released when I was still Grade School lmao. Damn this game is really good for its time. Since I have no GF, I wanted some scary Esper GF in valentine 2023.
[h1]FEAR1 + DLCs[/h1]
[h2]Pros:[/h2]
+ The graphics is around Half-Life 2/CS:CZ with many object physics. Not as good as CSS but better than cry of fear graphics. The characters design is similar to the sims 3/4 really, so no major memorable looks of character aside Alma (the esper goth GF). The game plays at night always and the darkness. lightning and if you bump to object just to scare yourself is 10/10 lmao. (Flipping trash can lid nonstop faster than nuclear reactor is possible).
+ The gameplay is smooth, while some enemies can be bullet sponges, headshot really saves your bullet sometimes lmao. If you not scared you'll be focused how to matrix your way cleaning every enemies in slow-mo and find your way. It's a full action game aside the horror aspect tho. So if you not easily scared or just a jack-@ss like me that just move forward without thinking much and kill yourself over and over you can miss some jumpscares or unsettling moment lmao (some i just realised from watching some youtube after finishing the game lol). At least the game has very few scripted horror moment and you can still move and jumping around freely tho.
+ The gore, particles, etc. really full action lmao. It's really fun to go gun blazing in this game. Is so satisfying that you forgot this is a horror game and scared midway lmao. For a 2005 game, really its ahead of it's time I think. Nowadays horror games is  either too realistic, rely on jumpscare, but lack of details of things to do. This game you can relieve yourself to fool around tho.
+ The A.I. of enemies really cool, they really try to position themselves to be behind cover, and know if you run away or reloading they charge to you, even if you listen the enemies radio they can pinpoint where you are and how they spotted you (like flashlight, seen, deadbodies, gunshot, etc.) not that flawless (sometimes they get stucks, confused, or not even know you if you stand right behind 3 of them lol) but really fun like stalker games. A thing that many nowadays game lazy and let the enemies just stand around being bullet sponges. Oh yeah grenade is actually deadly in this game, to you and enemies.
+ The story is pretty much straightforward. ""We""(since the multiplayer being shutdown by WBG bcs they have such little commitment to online game that scar them even today, and no P2P connection for campaign) are a special forces to subdue supernatural things. We must take down this one guy that become cannibal bcs he want to eat the daughter of scientist that held Alma to force the scientist to release Alma. Scumbags. And you know how it end bcs there's 2 more spin-off and 2 sequel of this game. Pretty straightforward.
+ DLC basically continuing the game, no major graphics or gameplay overhaul, but so far
[h2]Cons:[/h2]
- The NPC design really bad, they look similar to enemies, and we clearly don't know who is friend or foe (until I finished the game turn out we encounter mostly enemies) no indicator it was friendly or not, and that girl and bald man every start of chapter really don't do sh!ET to help us. We just a silent protagonist killing everything that moves and carry guns.
- The lack variety of enemies, while the AI is good the enemies too similar to each other. Variety we got is the invisible parkour guy that so fast that they often fall, the tanky guy that just annoying, the robot that more tankier than before. That's it. There's sniper guy but that just one level and never happened again everywhere else, or the turrets from above. Oh there's the lanky skinny ghost keep attacking you from blurs. But that's late game problems. The supposed to be main villain Alma the goth esper GF never actually attack or kills you.
- The level design is awful, you moved to 4-5 different buildings yet they feel the same. If you took break and forgot where to go you can feel stuck while the next objective is over there. Every room is similar, every wall color is similar, every escalator is goddamn identical, sometimes you can't be sure if you already go here or not. I'm not the only one since when I searched there's a lot people feel get stuck but the objective is right in front of you lmao. Pressing M dont really help at all your mission is always killing that picky cannibals. That's all their said. So search youtube if you feel stuck lol. No map, no waypoint. Really.
- So far if I'm not wrong there's only 7 weapon. 1 Gun that you can held 2 as dual guns, 1 rifle, 1 shotgun, 1 smg, 1 grenade launcher, 1 supposed to be sniper but similar to rifle, 1 anti tank gun maybe. Lack of variety and we can only bring 3. So choose the gun you liked, aside from damages all automatic weapon feel the same, burst shot with high recoil and low accuracy. Iron Sight isnt a thing for this game, the zoom in is as bad as bullpup form CS 1.6 just a zoom not helping recoils or stabilization at shooting, so I rarely using it and choose shotgun since so far it's the best gun, really. No need to play it far or anything.
- The swimming is annoying, the reflection of water is cool but when you inside the water you can see through above smh, and it janky AF making its hard to jump back to surfaces.
- There's some hints you can play things stealthly in some scenario but no, you must go gun blazing in the end. What a shame, some level design clearly made for stealth but since the A.I. detection is ungodly and once you hit one guy with melee found they all know where you are. Shame..
- The weapons sounds really imported from CS:CZ or CS 1.6. The shotgun sound same as AK-47 of CS 1.6 lol. Lack of Oomph and surround effect. Audio could be much better.
- Glad horror game nowadays get rid of it, but I HATED THE RINGING FLASHBANG. Really, it not inducing fear, it inducing headache, annoyance, and make my eardrum itchy AF. Whoever think this is scary should get tortured alone in pure white room and get headphones with 500% volume of this RINGING sfx. If there's a button to disable it or muted this spesific sfx, I'll gladly turn it off. The most annoying thing in this game.
- So is Alma 8 Y.O. girl? Why at the end shes adult and naked? Which one is alma? Both of them but 8 Y.O?!
[h1]FEAR 2[/h1]
[h2]Pros:[/h2]
+ The graphics now around Dead Space 2 or Mass Effect 2 but a bit lower resolutions in details. Improvement.
+ The Gunplay is modernized, around Doom 3 or Shadow Warrior 1. Now weapons not truly need to loot enemies to get upgrade or things aside handgun.
+ The story seems like reboot than sequels, so its pretty much modernized settings too.
+ There's some minigames and puzzle to solve, than just straightforward explore the map level. If you like it it can be a good point
+ Goth GF get cute and Sexy at the same time lmao. FBI OPEN UP!!!
[h2]Cons:[/h2]
- The game turned into regular horror games you find on steam. Rely on cheap jumpscares, scripted events, quicktime event, loud scream/SFX, etc. things you found in horror game around 2003-2007.
- The AI is a bit dumber, they often stay in one spot COD campaign style, you found where they hid, you shot them in the head. But at least they still try to flank you but the level design make it easier to us to find safe positions than the 1st game.
- The story is bad, its dumbed down of the 1st game. No clear character, no clear reason and consequences, no clear Lore. DLC didnt help at all just extension as FEAR 1.
[h1]FEAR 3[/h1]
Skip this game.
- The gameplay is pretty much COD, no identity
- AI pretty much Fallout 4
- Enemy is Alma again, why name it FEAR then? not ALMA
- The crazy guy from 1st game become your ghost bro.
- The story is written by grade schooler fandom.
- Killed the franchise

76561198449790888,1678437231,True,"""F.E.A.R."" is a first-person shooter video game that was first released in 2005 by Monolith Productions. The game has since received critical acclaim for its immersive storyline, solid gameplay mechanics, and intense action sequences.

The game's storyline revolves around a team of special forces operatives known as the First Encounter Assault Recon (F.E.A.R.) team, who are tasked with investigating a mysterious supernatural phenomenon in a fictional city called Fairport. The player takes on the role of the Point Man, a member of the F.E.A.R. team with unique psychic abilities that allow him to slow down time and see ghostly visions.

The gameplay mechanics in ""F.E.A.R."" are solid and intuitive, allowing for smooth and enjoyable gameplay throughout. The player has access to a variety of weapons, including pistols, shotguns, rifles, and even a missile launcher. The game also includes a cover system that allows the player to take cover behind objects and shoot at enemies without taking damage.

One of the standout features of ""F.E.A.R."" is its use of horror elements throughout the game. The game's atmosphere is often tense and eerie, and the use of jump scares and creepy supernatural phenomena adds to the overall horror experience. The game also features a number of boss battles, each with its own unique challenge and mechanics.

In terms of graphics and sound design, ""F.E.A.R."" is impressive for its time. The game's graphics hold up well even today, with detailed environments and character models. The sound design is also noteworthy, with a creepy soundtrack that adds to the overall horror atmosphere of the game.

Overall, ""F.E.A.R."" is a solid first-person shooter with a unique horror twist. The game's solid gameplay mechanics, intense action sequences, and immersive storyline make it a must-play for fans of the genre. Despite its age, the game holds up well and is still a great choice for players looking for a thrilling and intense gaming experience."
76561198068503751,1678394834,True,"[h3]one of the best horror games ever made[/h3]

This is a timeless G.E.M.! At the time F.E.A.R. was released, the game was way ahead of many others when it came to the combat system and ragdoll physics. There really is a lot of action due to many explosions and battles. The atmosphere is overkill. I got used to horrorgames but the jumpscares are still real good, Alma kinda makes you feel beeing watched the entire time.

The story is real good, i can also recommend to play [b]F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point[/b] and [b]F.E.A.R.: Perseus Mandate[/b] if you enjoyed the story."
76561198295994349,1678394498,True,"Quite a fun shooter, even in 2023, with a mix of soldiers and horror enemies.
The levels are a bit of a maze, even if most of the scenes play in offices,
but the way to progress is fairly logical to figure out."
76561197999290648,1678352955,True,"Decent. Combat against the basic soldiers feels nice. Good sound design and physics, everything has weight and impact to it. Guns all feel pretty satisfying to use.

My criticism is that it spends way too much time meandering with the player slowly walking through empty hallways with half-baked scares that quite literally never work. That, and combat never really evolves beyond the basic soldiers. Sure, there's a few more enemy types, but they rarely make an appearance in any capacity that matters, and when they do, they don't do much. There's a mech that shoots rockets and each rocket deals less damage than a bullet. Hilarious.

You die pretty fast, but difficulty is a joke if you're playing how the game wants you to. Medkits are handed out like candy and you can carry 10 of them at once, rarely ever dipping below 7 in your inventory unless you run into combat like an idiot on a regular basis. That's on Extreme, by the way.

Again, decent. Could've been more. Needs more enemies and less medkits.

Got it and its expansion packs on sale for like $1.19 offsite, definitely worth it if you can nab it for $5 or less. Absolute idiocy to buy the entire series for $50 on Steam just to get the one game you want. Look elsewhere for a better price."

76561198140442560,1677942835,True,"Playing FEAR in 2023 is a weird experience. It's dated in several ways, but still plays beautifully. The gunplay is undeniably the main draw here; not only do enemies still behave in impressive and interesting ways, but the slow mo effects of Point Man's abilities give real weight to the hilarious ragdoll physics. Plus, combat is among the most brutal I've seen in a realistic FPS. Blood sprays everywhere, the shtogun (which might be my favorite in all of gaming) can cut dudes in half or turn them into mince meat, totally disintegrating them, and enemies scream in pain as they die. Then again, that slow mo edge is what lets you get out of gunfights alive, as enemies are aggressive, and even two of them can pose a threat. You're constantly assessing your surroundings and making on the fly decisions, all while reverting in and out of slow mo. When the game has you fight enemies, it's exhilarating and still a lot of fun if you can get past the dated visuals and drab environmental design, which is admittedly very dull, filled as it is with samey corporate hallways and hidden maintenance paths. It's kind of like Die Hard, but there's no denying that the environments could have used more variety.

Story is a weird one. Despite how empowering the combat is, the story is a weird amalgamation of corporations run amok and J horror. Essentially, you're fighting a terrorist named Paxton Fettel, who can psychically control his army of clones. Meanwhile you dig into the history of Armacham, the shady corporation who has done some pretty messed up stuff. I'll be honest, the game is PLENTY bloody but I've never found it all that scary, even when I played it years ago. The actual plot kind of pushes believability  and has a plot twist that feels very random and doesn't really do much to add to what's come before, but it's definitely memorable for how unabashedly weird it is.

This game goes on sale all the time, and honestly I'd highly recommend it to fans of FPS's. There are definitely some problems with it, mainly with how straight up boring the environments and levels are, but the combat is just so much brutal fun that it almost doesn't matter.

Edited mini review upon completing Extraction Point: EP is a surprisingly lengthy epilogue to the base game, taking place right where the title ends and having Point Man navigate his way through ruined city streets as he tries to evacuate the city. There are a couple new enemy types like a shielded dude that wields a mini gun, and there are a couple new weapons such as the aforementioned mini gun, a laser beam, and a deployable turret. These are all really fun to use, just like the base game's weapons. The mini gun is excellent for the several ""stand and defend"" sequences you'll go through and the deployable turrets offer a slight but cool layer of tactics to certain sequences. Meanwhile, the laser beam can easily cut through a crowd of enemies, and I mean that literally. The first time I used it, it cut a dude clean in half and sent his two pieces flying across the room. It's fun, and adds several more hours to the game's solidly lengthy campaign. Additionally, the shorter length means there aren't quite as many sequences where you're running around the innards of a building, and there's a whole bunch of new environments to explore. It won't change your mind if you don't like the base game, but I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it.

Further edit upon completing Perseus Mandate: PM is a weird sidequel where you play as a separate FEAR squad as you experience events paralell to the main campaign. Where Extraction point felt like a nice expansion with new weapons, this feels like a padded out campaign with a couple cool new weapons like a lightning shooter. The thing is that the new weapons are rare, and the worst habits of padding from the other campaigns are on full display. Perhaps this is best enjoyed after a rest from the base game and Extraction Point, as it does nothing new. It's competent, and certainly delivers EVEN MORE of the FEAR action that made the game a hit, but it's certainly lacking that something that made the previous two entries special."

76561197972936095,1677490607,True,Classic Game with a great story and action scene's. Really enjoyed playing this game again after many years.
76561198019225041,1677457780,True,"I've always avoided FEAR, for some reason. I remember when it first came out, all the hype over it, friends and acquaintances at school creaming their pants over it--but it just looked like a FPS with the Max Payne/Matrix bullet-time gimmick. I was a huge fan of Max Payne 1 and 2, and the few games I played that tried their hand at bullet-time must've left a bad taste in my mouth. Add to that the fact that I wasn't really a fan of Monolith's games until Blood GDX came out (then Blood: Fresh Supply so I could enjoy it all over again), and even more so once I played the Shadow of Mordor games; with the glut of YouTube game reviewers (i.e., Civvie11, Mandalore, and Gman, amongst others) revisiting the first FEAR game & expansions in recent times, I figured I'd give it a shot.

It's actually a great game with some great atmosphere, addicting gameplay, a ho-hum kinda story (which wears its Japanese-horror movie influence on its sleeve) and pretty awesome enemy AI for its time. It still looks great and runs great on modern systems, too, with barely a hiccup playing on Windows 10. You might think that the slow-mo/reflex gimmick would get old fast, but no, it's just as glorious watching the blood geysers and explosion shockwaves the first time you see it as it is nearing the end of the game with better weapons and more and more enemies appearing with each encounter (hint: make sure you explore every nook and cranny for the health and reflex syringes to max out your enjoyment and make the game a touch easier); exploring, however, sometimes feels like a HUGE chore as the pointman (your characters name) runs as fast as pond water moves, and no configuration to make him move faster.

PROS:
+ still looks pretty great
+ lighting effects were revolutionary for their time and help w/ atmosphere
+ once you leave the docks/warehouses/sewers, the game opens up a bit more
+ great atmosphere
+ although cheesy at times, will legitimately spook you as well
+ BLOOD GEYSERS
+ Slow-mo is awesome
+ Guns are fun for the most part!

CONS:
- walk/run cycle slow as fuck
- exploration can be tedious
- a handful of weapons are underwhelming (the SMG is kinda lame, for instance)
- a bit heavy handed on the Japanese horror influence, may not be your style
- story is cheesy. then again, to paraphrase John Carmack from id software/DOOM fame, having a story in an FPS is like having a story in a pr0n, its not always necessary.

In the end, I would definitely still recommend this game in 2023, it's addicting and an absolute blast to play."

First let me start out by saying I played very limited amounts of F.E.A.R back in the day on 360 and I was already a decade late to the party. I was playing similar games like condemned which honestly barely stands a chance against this game in comparison. Shooting is on point, controls feel old but very adaptable. Story is original and compelling, This game really gripped me as a first time player and I enjoyed every second of this first game all the way to the end. Levels feel thought out and well put together, I really enjoyed moments in the game where i found several routes that I could have taken to complete my missions. I was super surprised that a game from 2004/2005 holds up so well especially in comparison to modern games today! 

Complete steal if you can get it on sale in any fashion."

There were times where I ended up spending a lot of time jsut trying to figure out where to go, but there are plenty of youtube videos to aid with that, and was only in the ""interval"" 7 inside the big office building it was an issue, it wasn't a reccuring issue.
The gun fighting is good and the horror elements creepy."
76561198090304246,1676564970,True,"Back in 2005, someone watched the A-horror movies too many times and decided to put a little ghost girl into a video game. The game was marketed as a horror game and I, being like 12 at the time, thought this was gonna be the scariest thing I'd ever seen.
It's not, it's an adequate shooter with creepy vibes. The first game really lays it on thick with jump scares for the first half, but like with any good ghost story, most of it is more creepy environment rather than actual scares. What resulted was a shooter that had better than average AI for the time that holds up pretty well even today.
Yes, it's old, it's dated, parts are gonna feel weird and clunky, and if you're on modern hardware you need a patch that's in the forums somewhere to fix the framerate drops, but it's still entirely worth playing."
76561198126741796,1676561204,True,"Some of thee most satisfying casual tactical combat in any fps, can be as fast paced and gun-ho or slow and methodical as you want, really makes you feel like a badass all the way through, story is solid and really gives that classic 2000's military gritty feel but also ""go shoot some bad guys"" no fucks given type humor, it's a gritty story that doesn't take itself too seriously and surprisingly has a good amount of funny moments. Great shooter, would recommend Hard difficulty for those who are familiar with FPS's and want a casual experience and Masochist for those who like to use actual tactics when playing."

Despite being a 17 year old horror game, it still gives some pretty fricken good spooks. Yeah it's lacking in some graphical creature comforts like good reflections, shading, SSAO, fog, bloom, etc. but the gore is fantastic and so is the physics system. The character models all look pretty good too. The voice acting is alright, but the action more than makes up for it. The only gripe I have with the game so far is that when aiming with the SMG/MP5K, there seems to be a weird delay from when I press my mouse to when it actually shoots, but it doesn't happen when I'm not aiming. Overall, pretty much ALL the guns could be a little more responsive as far as actually shooting exactly when you click your mouse. Other than that, this game was way ahead of it's time."

F.E.A.R still holds up well, with nice visuals (level design and application of lighting, shadows) and effective use of horror. The action is also solid and has you be somewhat tactical in how you approach each firefight. The plot is a bit light but the concept and execution are done well that it adds to the experience.

What a shame then that the sequels really mucked up it's legacy and fundamentally misunderstood what made the original so incredible.

There are few games that replicate what F.E.A.R does in terms of gunplay and atmosphere.

Do yourself a favour and PLAY THIS MASTERPIECE.

If anyone tells you that the AI in F.E.A.R is better than anything made nowadays, they are RIGHT. I literally have not seen another game come remotely close to how AI tries to topple the player. The Replica Soldiers actively communicate with each other, use equipment thoughtfully and are always trying to flank you when you least expect it. Check out [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQN3yKYkFmE]this video[/url] showing how the soldiers operate.

I truly wish Monolith with return to the F.E.A.R series with either a new entry or even a remake/remaster, but I fear (lol) that they will miss the mark at what made this classic shine in the first place.

It's not really the kind of horror game that's gonna have you jumping out of your seat or anything but it does do a good job at making the environments you traverse through unsettling/creepy.

76561198092034210,1674692025,True,"Great classic FPS. Alma managed to scare the bejesus out of me once, and kudos for that! The game will encourage explorers with permanent health and reflex (more on that in a sec) boosts, and entering combat via alternative paths tend to give you an edge. 

There is a slowdown mechanic that the player can activate at any moment (as long as he still has enough of it) which can really turn the tide in your favour. There is a peeking mechanic too, which is nice. And hopefully enough weapons to keep you using your favourites. 

The game tends to be repetitive after a short while since many enemies have the same skins, though I didn't mind.

The game heavily relies on ambience, always making it feel like you don't know what's around the corner, which is on of the biggest reason why it's not a trudge to keep going for a dated game.

The AI is also very solid (though a bit exploitable, like any AI) compared to a lot of more recent games.

Something to keep in mind, however, is that you will need to download a small fix so you won't be getting FPS drops after a rather short session. Nothing complicated at all.

Edit: Boy oh boy, the DLCs have worse crashes. Fixable... But come on maaaaan. Give this classic some love, please?

The combat, gunplay and A.I. still hold up to this day and is even better than most modern games, which is saying something. The graphics and visuals are still nice to look at, especially the lighting which still holds up for it's age as well.

I think my main criticism however are the level designs, more-so the aesthetics for most maps. All of em feel samey and kind of boring to look at due to the washed out color palette etc. But it's not the worst I've seen.

Story I feel is serviceable, it's nothing too fancy or too jarring though I think the gameplay was the game's biggest selling point. The Horror elements do their job but it's far from perfect when it comes to the horror aspect of the game.

This is a must-have if you love FPS games let alone action horror."
76561197975423126,1674229880,True,Still holds up.
76561198098071576,1674195680,True,"F.E.A.R. is a game I heard nothing but good things about for a long time. I usually avoided this series, expecting it to be way more horror-oriented than it was action. But once I finally saw gameplay footage, I was in. Though it took me till January 2023 to finally get my hands on the complete pack on Steam before I played any of these games. How is it? Well...

The gameplay and visuals honestly hold up pretty well, all things considered. It's a fantastic FPS with a bullet-time mechanic and a few horror elements sprinkled in. If Phasmophobia and DOOM 3 didn't scare you, then this probably won't either because I feel that it's more mellow than those (though that may have been because of some settings I changed too, but still).

And the A.I. continued to surprise me over and over as I played the game. I have rarely found an A.I. capable of spotting my flashlight when there's a pretty sizable wall between us, which sounds like a bug but it was more like they were actually spotting my light hit the wall across the room from all of us, so it was a realistic spotting of my light. Even if they weren't spotting the light hitting the wall I was pointing at, it really looked like they were. Then, later in the game I launched a guy's corpse and his teammate appeared to duck under him as he whizzed by. Granted, these instances could just be coincidence or perfect timing, especially that last one, but even so, every time I thought I knew what they were capable of, they did something else new that was pretty impressive. Kinda just makes me sad that a lot of A.I. in modern shooter campaigns feels dumbed down a lot by comparison.

Now, three main gripes with the game: 
1. You need to install fan patches if you wanna run this game at 1080p60 or higher. Without the patches it only does up to 1080p30, and a very choppy-feeling 1080p30 at that. Thankfully these patches were pretty easy to install and get up and running, and luckily if you just want 1080p60 you don't have to install as much stuff.

2. The only way you can buy this right now is via the F.E.A.R. Complete Pack Bundle. But the counterpoint to that is that it's like $10 during a sale so I can't complain too much about either of these points.

3. Whenever the game saves, it freezes a little bit. This apparently has to do with the engine and seems to be unfixable, patches or otherwise. You get used to it and the freezes usually are not too intrusive.

F.E.A.R. is without a doubt one of the G.O.A.T.s even 20 years later is still super fun and well put together. If the occasional ghost encounter or hallucination doesn't scare you too intensely, you definitely need to check this out if you haven't already."

Story on the other hand, makes no sense!
F.E.A.R. started with a cool idea and turned out to be terribly uninteresting. Things happen to our mysterious hero through “shadows” and “vision” – nothing out of the ordinary, right? But then they made the game an FPS, which means soldiers shoot things, and things got increasingly ridiculous until the game ended up with a plot that didn’t make sense. Oh and let’s not forget the sometimes segued into waking nightmares, where you’re fighting some hooded stranger to the tune of John Carpenter’s Halloween theme.

Enemy AI is impressive, but doesn’t challenge player.
If you played the game, you will be aware of the impressive enemy AI. But my question is this: Why don’t we challenge the player a little more? When you have that many enemies attacking at once, the combat becomes fairly mindless – just hold one button and fire – and that, I’m afraid, can take its toll on some players sanity.

And this level design... I just can't...

Most would consider 2 and 3 far inferior to the first game, and the first game came out almost 20 years ago. Is this really a 55$ bundle considering 2 of the dlcs are considered bad, the 3rd game is highly mixed and Fear 2 is generally unfavored to FEAR 1, which should be sold at a base price of $9.99 WITH the expansion packs included.

This package should be sold at $30 max, each game is worth about $10 period anymore. The games are quality and hold up okay in most regards but I can't recommend this pack to a newcomer of the franchise, considering the age of the games, lack of updated features, no multiplayer, and competitive pricing. FEAR was popular and is still very fun to play but I don't think the first game should be locked behind a 55$ paywall and I don't think the combined value of all 3 games and the dlc is worth that anymore, either.

The effectiveness of every single weapon in the game combined with the unpredictability of the enemy tactics give it endless replay value.

Down sides are what I feel is a weak ending gameplay wise (but good story) and a level design that can be easy to get lost in at times, but this is eventually solved by how replayable the game is, the pacing is absolutely perfect once you get a handle on each level.

Cannot recommend at least trying this game and if you like it try the expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. Ignore FEAR 2 and 3, they feel nothing at all like this game.

It can drag a bit too long and the enemies you fight at the end are a letdown but overall this a great horror fps anyone should play.

The expansions are good overall as well. They introduce new weapons, enemies, scares, and levels. Some scares from the base game are reused, and some of the story moments in these don't quite land like in the original but overall theyre still good. 

If you play at resolutions above 1080p you will need to look into a fix to make the ui bigger, and the expansions run poorly in some levels where you need to turn graphics down to progress."

It is a horror game but it wasn't really that scary but it did have it's moments where the atmosphere kept you on your toes. For being a game from 2005 the graphics aren't that bad.

I have not played the rest of the F.E.A.R. games yet so I don't know how good they are so I will return with an update on if the 55€ are justified or not. If you're only looking to play this game obviously don't get the bundle, you can buy the games separately on humble bundle."

Perhaps I'm a bit bias because it was one of my earliest games, and the very first game I ever watched on Youtube back in the day, but this game still gives me a wonderful amount of joy.

Graphics are very dated, even on max settings. Smoke physics are a bit of a pain - you can't see anything! Had terrible framerate at the start, but found a fix on steamcommunity with a DLL that apparently fixes issues around an old library for mouse/keyboard. Running smoothly now.

Reasonably challenging. Enemies make perfect shots all the time. Easy to move around, but some where-do-I-go-now type puzzles, which are a pain. An interesting mix of horror and FPS.

7/10 for the old school charm, but would want them to heavily discounted if I didn't already own them"
76561198145640129,1671535745,True,underrated masterpiece
76561198343640249,1671485845,True,"F.E.A.R combat and gameplay, are all the game developers at Monotlih are trying to push and have players experience. The main gameplay loop is for the Point man to go from place to place, and get into shootouts in between checkpoints. The main selling point of the experience is the Point Mans ability to slow down time, and pick off enemies one by one before time runs out. As well you will push buttons to open doors, switch loadouts, and send information your director Betters. Not very stimulating in general, as the game really lacks variety in gameplay and approaches for the player to solve problems, as well it is very repetitive. What helps spice things up is the enemy A.I which actively works to advance the player and take them out with high degrees of ferocity and tactics. They can flank the player, attempt to flush them out with grenade drops, maneuver around the level to take cover or search for the player, and much more. But all this mystique and intelligence felt lost as the game went on, as I’m not sure if I’ve mentioned but the game is repetitive, so I started to loose that sense of threat when I became accustomed to the game. Small tips: quick save often, and try get in the habit of healing whilst using the slow motion ability.

Overall F.E.A.R presents a simple and un-engaging plot, and a narrative brimming with unrecognised potential. All in an effort to give some level of context to the games selling point of slow-motion shooting I believe, and if this was the developers main goal, then more power to them, but I felt we could have the great gameplay and a story that makes me feel anything at all. As it stands, there is a disconnect between the gameplay, the story, and the Japanese horror elements. Did not like it.

Overall, F.E.A.R. presents an interesting fictional division of paranormal suppressors that could’ve been interesting and cool to follow, had their potential been recognised or even glanced at. They are overall incredibly disappointing and uninteresting characters to play alongside and to follow.

The world presented in F.E.A.R is uninteresting and void of life. Atmospherically it is quite good, with that emptiness playing into how alone and vulnerable we as the Point Man feel when traversing, as literally everything is trying to kill you, or forces you into things.

F.E.A.R seeks nothing more than to present audiences with it’s core selling point of slow motion shooting. It makes no effort to tell and interesting story, present a fascinating world, or give compelling characters. It merely seeks to make players have a sense of fun with killing people in slow motion by sacrificing deeper context for repetitive gameplay and shallow combat, and for me, even that goal alone I think is worth applauding and valuing, as they gave gamers something they’ve never played before. Even now, F.E.A.R’s slow motion combat has not been replicated (as far as I know), leaving F.E.A.R as the only game on the market currently (Dec, 2022) with this mechanic. As well I applaud Monolith’s attempts at making a horror styled shooter. Finally, I believe that F.E.A.R still holds up today, and is noteworthy for it’s slow motion mechanic, and its’ Artificial Intelligence."

Bots - they are great. They communicate with each other, they go around you and tries to shoot you in the back. They give commands to each other and report your position. That is really great.

Weapons - they are great. I liked nail-gun a lot. Then pistol, rocket launcher, shotgun (of course), automatic, grenades, ... and a lot of others. Plenty of ones to get your favorite one.

76561198930515950,1671139252,True,"Some of the best shooting mechanics i've ever played with!
The story follows the point man as they try to hunt down Paxton Fettel while also dealing with the paranormal ongoings, including a mysterious girl by the name of Alma who causes death and destruction in here path. The characters and the story are probably the weakest parts of this game as both are forgettable and and do nothing unique to care about its plot.
The settings of the game are really well layed out with each area taking what would be typical locations for a shooter and creates a really immersive horror atmosphere with their being loads of dark areas and paranormal events that add more to the tone of the game. 
Visually, for the time that this game was made in, it looks really good. Performance was was pretty good and didn't encounter any glitches or bugs throughout my playtime. However there was a problem with the frame rate as it would be stuck at 30 or even 20 at points, however there is a fix for this that can be used for both this game and Condemned: Criminal Origins that allows the game to run at 60 FPS. The art direction they went with was done in a clever manor as using the horror aspect really allowed there to be more creative and memorable moments in the set pieces. 
Sound and Audio were also great with the soundtrack being filled with ominous ambience that added to the tone that this game was going for to the audio of weapons, enemies and even environmental items fitting perfectly with this game. 
In terms of gameplay, this is the reason that this game has went down as a classic. The guns the you can use all feel great to shoot with my favourites being the shotgun and the particle gun. I like how the game rewards the player for exploration as it can lead to more ammo or health/Slow-Mo bars increasing. The Slow-Mo ability is really fun to play with as it allows for some sweet kills and cool moments the player can perform. The enemies in this game are also really impressive with them having really good AI such as flanking the player, using grenades to get players out of cover or even just retreating when there is one guy left while he's limping. 
Overall, F.E.A.R has its flaws, but makes up for these with its fantastic atmosphere and some of the greatest gameplay that has ever came to gaming."

76561198016756547,1670457749,False,"For a '05 release, F.E.A.R.'s gunplay and pacing puts most FPS titles up to a decade later to shame. Featuring the most sophisticated enemy AI for its time and a roster of strong guns with excellent audiovisual feedback, the game even sprinkled in some Japanese horror to keep players on the edge of their seat. It's a great 7-8 hours that FPS fans should experience. 

The same cannot be said for W.B.'s predatory sales practices. This game cannot be bought separately from the ridiculous $55 bundle. Do not buy this on Steam, check out Green Man Gaming or other sites instead. Potential customers should also be aware that F.E.A.R.'s expansions have known crashing issues with Windows 10 and later."

76561198147861397,1670297349,True,"I'm not sure I'd call it a horror game, but F.E.A.R. is definitely a dark shooter. Solid gunplay that feels excellent with the deathmatch-inspired level design; every area is this well connected space that offers the player and the enemies many entrances and exits that keep it fresh. It can get a bit repetitive after your 15th office building floor, but other than that, the base game is really solid. Felt really balanced on the hardest difficulty. Game has atmosphere in spades as the harsh lighting, military callouts, and tense horror continuously keep the experience interesting. Definitely isn't as revolutionary as it may have once been, but good nonetheless. 

Extraction Point is a solid few hours that expands on the original experience but I don't think it's as well balanced or interesting. Has a few cool moments and a few interesting weapons but nothing groundbreaking.

Perseus Mandate? Ehh... probably skip this one. Feels jarring compared to the rest as the level design, lighting, and overall polish feel lacking. Definitely felt a bit of fatigue as it can feel like a series of combat rooms instead of a progressing story after enough time."

76561198328240003,1669960908,True,Pretty good action shooter game with sprinkles of horror. The problem is that it starts dragging on after the first hour and takes forever for anything interesting to happen. Enemy variety is pretty meh as well
76561198080671620,1669949036,True,"I don't often write game reviews, but this one deserves it. I remember first playing FEAR as a kid while at a friend's birthday party many years ago and didn't really know what to make of it at the time. Having come back to check it out as an adult, I feel confident in saying that it is probably one of the absolute best shooting games ever made. The sheer, unbelievable degree of environmental destruction is rivaled by very few games, and I would wager none in quite so spectacular a fashion. The VK-12 is an absolute monster of a shotgun, and takes the destruction to a whole new level. It will make the entire room start exploding and will liquefy any poor sod unfortunate enough to be standing in front of it. The enemy AI is a master class in creating a challenging force to fight against, and at times can almost feel like playing against real people with the level of coordination and strategy that it is capable of. Play the same gunfight a dozen times and it'll never turn out quite the same way. Not to mention, with the inclusion of bullet time and ninja kicks, every fight becomes thrilling, dynamic, and lets you feel like an absolute badass when you win.

The only particularly bad thing I have to say about the game is that the story is rather bland, but then that isn't really why you should be playing. It's only there as a device to keep the game moving forward and it does that perfectly sufficiently. If you like wild and challenging gunplay that never gets old then accept no substitute. FEAR is about as good as it gets."

76561198181474903,1669425145,True,"F.E.A.R. reminds me of Half-Life in all of the best ways. Something horrible happens at a lab and you, the silent protagonist with a gun, must stop it. The unsettling atmosphere in the tight corridors, the fights against soldiers with awesome AI, and the fact that you are taking all of this on by yourself makes it seem like this is Half-Life 2 from an alternate universe where Valve decided to pursue the horror genre rather than the action one.

Make no mistake, the game's actual horror elements are not particularly scary. The blood and gore comes off as more cool and punchy (the various ways you can take down enemies is brutally delicious). I found myself wanting to give Alma a hug rather than shoot at her (what... just me?). The actual horror (rather, suspense) comes from the way the maps are laid out. Lighting is used to great effect and you never know what you're going to see around the next corner.

Rather than a continuation of Half-Life's story, F.E.A.R. feels like it builds on a lot of its ideas in terms of gameplay and atmosphere while refining them, then adds a few of its own. The slow motion mode is really fun and lets you experiment a lot with the other mechanics. Being able to lean in any FPS makes it better and I'll fight anyone who disagrees. In F.E.A.R. the leaning is necessary, with all of the hallways and cover you can take in the firefights with some seriously good AI even by today's standards (even especially, some might say).

It's safe to say I really liked this game, but it's not without its problems. Being such an old title, there are a few mods that are necessary to install if you're going to be playing it at a modern resolution, and some of the graphic options don't hold up quite as well today (like the soft shadows, not a huge fan of those but they're better than the default ones). The game has physics issues over 60FPS, which gave me a tiny bit of eye strain from time to time but that's likely due to my monitor being on the slightly slower side. The movement in the game is crisp, but I do wish there was an option to sprint, and all of the melee stuff was so slow I never used it, despite there being quite a few options for different attacks.

I played the game on the medium difficulty, and honestly found it to be pretty easy. I kept wondering if the game was going to give me a huge boss that I needed to use all of my medkits and ammo for, and that notion really made me conserve all of my more powerful ammunition. Towards the end of the game, I realized this probably wasn't going to happen, and most of the time I was given medkits I was already at full health, so I pretty much went guns blazing. It did hamper the atmosphere of the game a bit, so I would recommend playing on a harder difficulty.

Alas, a final boss does not exist in this game. I really wish it did in some form. It would have been cool to see one of the antagonists turn into some messed up creature and require multiple phases to defeat. Instead, all you get is some hallucinations floating toward you and, especially with how many medkits are given in this section, it was really underwhelming. Again, either play on a harder difficulty or, if you're a masochist, try playing without the slow-mo.

If you are a fan of the original Half-Life, I think you'll like this game. It's got a bit of a different story, but pretty much everything else is intact, including busting open vents to crouch through and environmental platforming. I actually did not like Half-Life 2 very much, but F.E.A.R. certainly scratched the itch I had for more of what I loved in Half-Life. Give it a shot if you haven't already!"

Game also features some really impressive AI for its time, having them actively flank and ambush the player in an unscripted fashion is truly fantastic to experience and having lighting actually be part of the game mechanics makes me a happy boy (more games need to do that). Story isn't anything to marvel over but it did its job to keep me engaged enough to keep me from skipping the cutscenes.

I burned a VCD (yes, really) and took it home to my brother who also loved the demo. Then came 2005, I was recently graduated from college and had bought a new PC with the money from my first job. F.E.A.R. was the 2nd or 3rd game that I bought for my shinny, new PC. I played it with my expectations SKY HIGH...and didn't get past Interval 3 or 4 before getting distracted by other games. 

That 17 year old younger self...he was an idiot. I chose this game as my spooky, Halloween game this year (Thanks, Civvie 11) and was pleasantly surprised to know that this game not only holds up as a in-betweener betwixt the ""Boomer Shooters"" of the past and the military shooters of the...slightly less past, but it still provides wonderful shooting mechanics and slow motion badassary in spades.

F.E.A.R Extraction Point Review: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198400190880/recommended/21110/"
76561198205579379,1668103430,True,"The game is really atmospheric and pretty much keeps you on edge, but really, it's more of an action-based, FPS game, but with matrix-like mechanics. It's engaging for most of the time, and the slow-mo feature is a real treat. Get the bundle, you won't be sorry."
76561198253546520,1668084222,True,"The outstanding use of lighting and particle effects with decent texture quality and animations helps the game stay timeless. 

Combat is engaging and rewarding with somewhat intelligent AI who don't funnel into your crosshair and a limited pool of weapons that have benefits and tradeoffs combined with a limited bullet-time function. Unfortunately, there isn't much enemy variety for large parts of the game but the tactics the AI uses, and the placement of different types of enemy units and roles help keep them fresh.

The screenshots on the steam page do not give justice to how most of F.E.A.R is presented.

I'm useless at horror games so besides a single jumpscare courtesy of the enemy AI, I don't have much to say.

The delivery of the story in F.E.A.R is a greater horror story than the main plot, a large part of the dialogue between characters runs completely contrary to the gritty presentation of the horror elements, the world, optional voicemails available to listen to and content of the computer data analyses. Norton and Alice stand out as two of the worst examples of one-dimensional characters. Almost all the time and effort in this game is spent on combat.

The big reveal of the story (minus a part of the context) is almost immediately given to you and is repeated throughout the game which hugely softens its impact unless you were lucky enough to not get it or weren't paying attention. Any impact this revelation has is solely on the player as the character you play is a completely blank slate who doesn't have any thoughts presented at any time.



There's a reason why you can now only buy F.E.A.R as a series-wide bundle: the games after Extraction Point have a terrible reputation. I'm yet to play them but would not recommend buying the bundle at full price: wait for the Steam or Humble Bundle discounts that occur every month or two which drop the price by 85% (~£36 -> ~£5)."

Its still an impressive looking game a decade on as well, which is a feat worth commending. Unfortunately you can't buy it on steam. Not anymore at least. If you want to play it, and its accompanying DLCs, you have to buy it with its sequels included. Whether that's something you want to do (you shouldn't) or not is irrelevant. The fact that you can't buy it own its own is ridiculous. Fortunately you can do that on GOG with its two DLCs included and DRM free to boot. Why you can't do that on steam anymore? No clue.

76561198066935531,1667967050,True,"When I was a kid my friend wanted to show me this game. When the game started the menu gave off some tense atmosphere (a lot of old games had those ""mysterious"" dark menus for some reason) but when the intro came to the moment where cannibalism was shown with all the twitching of the poor dead soul i just didn't feel well. We turned off the game and went outside. I've never felt such discomfort while playing a game ever since.
Playing it now all these years later I kind of laugh at my initial reaction from way back.

The gameplay is very simple and enjoyable. The controls need a bit of rebinding and the graphics need a bit of tweeking since it runs like sh*t on new hardware. Leaning mechanics were very usefull in this game i must say. The enemy AI is not all that good when you compare it to what we had during the day. They aren't terrible but not really good. They have good awareness and interesting mechanics but most of the times are quite predictable. The grenades are hard to dodge at times since the level design is very claustrophobic. The weapon selection is fair and the enemy variety is alright. The game doesn't overstay its welcome and that is a good thing. Things don't get too repetitive until the end. The story is easy to follow and done well. What complements it is the sound design and some solid voice acting. But what is the best thing about the game is the ATMOSPHERE. And Oh my is it tense. I love it. There are a lot of sequences where there are no enemies, just visual storytelling that is done by the ambience alone. A little crack here, something moved over there. Jumpscares are practically nonexistent which is a GREAT thing (they would ruin the experience).

This is an Action Horror game done right."
76561199153396975,1667945863,True,"Pretty good shooter, is what I would have said if I didn't have to play it at 10-15fps because none of the solutions work for me sadly. Also, the game is called FEAR but never once was the atmosphere really scary, just quiet for the most part with the occasional scream of a clone whose arm I just shot off. Overall a decent game.

Since the two dlcs don't have a review tab of there own, I'll add them to the base game review.  They finally up the scare factor for the game, even got me once with the clone commander appearing right behind me, and they made some quality of life improvements,such as auto picking up health, armor, ammo, etc. Some new enemies make an appearance and Alma  is used much more than in the base game which was great to see.

76561198012707869,1667646465,True,"As someone who has played a hell of a lot of FPS games, horror does little for me generally speaking, but this was such a solid offering. I bought this a little over a decade ago due to it's dirt cheap price (£1.74, I think) and after starting multiple times throughout, finally got around to finishing a few days ago after looking through my library for some atmospheric games to play. I have to applaud Monolith for their work here, actually. The gun-play has aged, sure, but... somehow feels pretty solid due to it's mix of high octane and tactical elements and I was kept on the edge of my seat metaphorically speaking for the entire length of the campaign with some mixing up of enemy archetypes. This particular play-through I tried to pace into a week or 2, but by day 3 I just went all in due to being so pulled in by it. I even went on to do it's 2 expansions the day after finishing!

The fact that Alma just turns up practically anywhere is truly terrifying. Some events I didn't even see her and when I rolled back some GeForce recordings would see her in the corner of my screen somewhere random, it was truly chilling and due to it's atmosphere you are always concerned she, or some other paranormal event is coming around most corners even if nothing happens for a while. What really helps the unsettling feeling from this game is the lighting. How on earth does the lighting look so damn good 17 years on? The game is semi open in it's corridor setup in that there is some lore to be found if you go off the main path (intel as was customary hidden object inclusion back then), but it does a great job with clever lighting pushing you towards the area you want to be heading in multiple areas so you don't get too lost if you wish to forward the narrative, which is nothing ground breaking (by today's standards), but kept me thoroughly intrigued and was also fairly solid.

So... What's wrong with it? Well... A Lot, actually, It crashes almost constantly when running in a 16:9 resolution (4K in my case) - when tabbing out, or back in, when loading levels, when loading checkpoints, basically anywhere at any time and if it doesn't crash, it runs at an atrocious framerate until you reset the game (I say atrocious, a playable 17-40FPS for me, but that's down from it's average of 4-600ish) so it's recommended to play it in 4:3, how it was designed. Then there's the issues with Logitech, or Xbox controller drivers which required a community DLL download and the fact that it doesn't natively support controller input which given it's age is expected. Despite all of it's crashing and driver conflicts I just couldn't put it down as the quick save feature really meant minimal losses occurred in these instances, though.

Final thoughts: Whilst playing this, I couldn't help comparing the gun play to Half-Life. It's much better here in my opinion as is it's primary focus, but there was also something eerily familiar about it. I've also just come off finishing the full anthology including DLC and this, or Extraction Point was the best of them all by considerable margin. In fact, this has gone straight into my Steam favourites and I look forward to replaying it!"

76561198080924808,1667602578,True,"F.E.A.R. is a very competent shooter, and a rewarding play for FPS fans. While the story didn't grip me and the enemy variety was a little underwhelming, F.E.A.R.'s strengths are sufficient to carry the player through what will probably amount to an 8-12 hour playthrough with plenty of enjoyment. The weapons arsenal, level design, AI performance and gameplay mechanics have aged very well, leading to F.E.A.R. remaining a highly playable shooter in 2022."
76561197983746737,1667593648,True,"FEAR is definitely up their for one of the best FPS games ever made, definitely in the top 15-20, which is a lot. I would like to place it higher, but there are a few shortcomings that stand out, like the repetitive nature of good chunks of the level design and art design. However one simply has to recognize that what the Monolith team were able to achieve in 2005 is truly remarkable especially from a technical perspective (and only a short amount of time after games like Doom 3 and Half-Life 2). Also the horror side of the game is still pretty good to this day, which surprised me personally.

What's here is an amazing foundation that was improved upon in some respects in Extraction Point and FEAR 2 but altered by corporate politics on all sides and console-first design in the latter - and never truly followed up on. (FEAR 3, made by Day 1 Studios, actually began life as Vivendi's original attempt at a non-Monolith ""FEAR 2"", but retooled by WB when Vivendi sold the rights back to the FEAR name) 

A real follow up starring the Point Man done by Monolith never came to fruition, and that's a shame, because what's in FEAR1 is absolutely spectacular. This is definitely an FPS game you have to play at some point, and it's very fun on the punishing highest difficulty setting. Also, if you own a Steam Deck, this is one of the killer apps for it IMHO. Must-buy."

Bake at 350' for eight hours. At spoopy scares and scary-sound speaker for flavor.

The music is a mediocre fest of generic ambience that would have fit a sci fi horror game signifigantly better, getting stuck on geometry, the subtitle size tied to your resolution, no controller support, the fears are neither horrorific or scary, often bordering more on hillarious, the devs set enemies to spawn when you pick up health kits, the voice recordings only matter after a certain number of levels, voice diloague isn't mixed at the same volume, and I've watched rockets go through enemies so many times that it makes me wonder why exactly they even bothered implimenting the rocket launcher.

It's not bad. It's perfectly serviceable, worth playing on sale, and I'm sure it was grand ol' time when it came out. Now? Outside of the slowdown mechanic, it's one of the most generic first person shooters I've ever played. I don't care if the AI is advanced.

yes it is"
76561198068160284,1667171282,True,"This is a conditional recommendation based on two factors. The first is the performance on modern computers. FEAR runs on an older version of the LithTech engine and seems to have problems with some features of modern operating systems (maybe something to do with USB peripheral drivers?). The game also has a problem with certain options. The framerate and crash issues are almost entirely solved by a new dll file and a 4GB patch available on https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/F.E.A.R.. They're easy to install, but require the user to copy some files to the correct place.

The second condition is the means in which the game is sold. It seems that now FEAR can only be purchased as part of a bundle of all FEAR games.  I'd say the bundle is worth it on a deep discount, even if the other FEAR games aren't amazing. The inclusion of this game and its first expansion makes it worth it and the remaining games are not totally bad. 

If these two conditions can be met, FEAR is one of the best shooters made during this century. Anyone who likes shooters to make an effort to play this game."

76561197961091423,1667146782,True,"[h1]What do you fear?[/h1]

I wanted to revisit what I originally thought was just a ""strictly okay"" game back in 2006 or whenever I first played it. I was way too pessimistic about this game back then. In retrospect, I think FEAR really does deliver on the feeling of ""overpowered, insane action"" that it marketed itself as. The use of the bullet time, arena design, sound design, and the innovative Goal Oriented Action Planning-driven AI make every combat scenario feel like a struggle. I know GOAP has fallen out of favor with the AI systems in Unity and Unreal, but it creates this exciting sandbox where no scenario is the same, and the experience feels fresh and challenging from the start to the end. Nothing really compares.

The game's story isn't bad either. Good use of worldbuilding and homage to horror and Hong Kong action throughout, but it literally falls apart at the end. The presentation is good, though. The visuals are a bit dated (and I felt like they were at launch, too) but Monolith was able to match its competitors at the time. The art style feels intentionally flat, which irked me back in the day, but now, not so much.

This game is a recently remembered darling for many reasons. Find out for yourself.

i remenber when i was 12 years old, i went to my friend's house and saw F.E.A.R on his PS3 back in 2007, i was like, damn this game is awesome! but i got scared and didn't wanted to play it, then later on in the same year my stepdad bought this game and i used to watch him play it and i kept with the same thought ""this game is awesome!"", now it's 2022 and i remenbered that this game exists, so i thought, why not play F.E.A.R?, i had a feeling that it would feel weird playing an old game, but, the feeling was complete the opposite! 

The game is really really fun to play, the scary moments are good, i even got scared because of the jumpscares and creepy moments that this game offers. 

This game has a good story, the gunplay is cool, the sound effects are awesome and the graphics are good considering that this game was made in 2005, what really helps this game have nice graphics are the shadows and the visual effects.

One thing i particularly like about this game is that the replicas (enemies) voice lines interaction with each other are very good, they can also say something different depending on your actions, here are some examples, when you kill 2 replicas, they will say something like ""we lost 2 men"", when you kill one replica they will say: ""man down"", when you activate the slow motion power and start killing them very fast, the replicas will say ""he is too fast"", when you leave only 1 replica alive, he will say something like ""what should i do?""

76561197964228938,1666246666,True,"Legit used to play this in the dark back in 2005 and scared the hell out of me.

The only FPS I've played where you have ample amounts of ammo to murder everything you see and some little girl scares the hell out of you climbing down a ladder.

Replay this every few years because it's just that good. Even the bland office buildings and samey areas still just feels so dark and evil."
76561198042622630,1666228325,True,A classic. Make sure to play this every October!
76561198325393878,1666209721,False,"Another example of steam needing a meh recommendation, this game is not bad at all, but i find it drastically overrated. This game came out on my second birthday, so i was far too young to play it, though i absolutely love this generation of games between 1998 and 2006 i just can't find it in myself to enjoy this, i found the horror parts nice but the gameplay got stale over time, not fast. but by the end i dreaded every fight encounter because it was the same slow mo same enemy same guns. didn't matter what weapon i used or what they used the ai mostly acts the same. i've heard this game was groundbreaking and sort of the Half Life or Halo of its year, i can't see that at all. if you like mid 2000s shooters and spooky stuff i'd recommend other stuff but you can try this out too, not my thing.
Reading the other reviews makes me feel like im crazy, did we play the same game? greatest fps of all time? wha???"

The first is good ... you like jump scare then this game is for you .. don't spend too much i recommend .. if your are getting it cheap go for it... The problem is with the DLC of this game the fear extraction point... I don't know it the game or my window but the game keep crashing...

76561198174030853,1665839784,True,"I enjoyed the parts of the game that did not involve enemies — the atmosphere is effective, and the visuals are very pleasant.

Sadly, the bulk of the game comprises of combat, which in itself consists mostly of slowing down time and counter-acting recoil to repeatedly shoot in the head bullet-sponge-esque enemies.

On Hard difficulty, this game is quite easy, and readily available quick-saves ensure that no deviation from this occurs.

The last forty minutes or so are quite good, however.

Overall, I'd say that this is a 6.5/10"
76561198068170890,1665833782,True,"If you like Half-Life, you'll love spooky Half-Life.

76561198440411081,1665670393,True,Great game!
76561198155556024,1665646168,True,"you're keanu reaves in the matrix. The AI is something to marvel at considering it was made in 2005, especially on higher difficulties, i guess its a horror game but wow its crazy how good this game is, especially considering the FEAR games which came after it."
76561198985228175,1665640955,True,I GOT LAID AFTERWARDS :)
76561198061696294,1665640729,True,"It's an old game... but it checks out. Almost 20 years and it stands up to the test of time in most places. The lean feature is pretty dated, but somehow ends up being better than FEAR2's ""cover"" mechanic because it can actually be useful. The weapons slap (apart from losing your dual wield pistol easily), the numbered health system with a billion medpacks would be better as a regen health (but I think no one was doing that at the time), and I wish the actual freaky enemies would show up more. Level design is more hit than miss, but you'll have to wade through the first 1/3 of the game to see the hits.

If you're looking for a great story go elsewhere; if you're looking for scary ... well I hope you like jump-scares because they haven't quite figured out how to turn unease into dread; but if you like shooters and want to witness the dawn of modern enemy AI then you gotta play it."
76561198219916699,1665639415,True,Never had so much fun.... in a fps horror shooter
76561199396429353,1665625085,True,I liked that the AI wasn't completely braindead. For me anyway. Had a good time with it all the same.
76561199076640190,1665624600,True,this is how you make a great singleplayer FPS.  plays like a first person max payne with narrative similarities to bioshock (which came out after this)
76561198035793258,1665618058,True,Yes.

76561198129570459,1665590788,True,"F.E.A.R is the epitomy of ""old games still rock"". A very good paranormal FPS pretty well-balanced between encounters and scary moments. AI is very good and feels like real people (talking to each other, trying to flush you out, telling command about how many you kill). 
Overall a great game with the only drawback being the awful portage on Steam that needs 100 mods installed for it to work and the people of the community simping for Alma (WTF men)."
76561198058235121,1665576992,True,Made me pucker a few times.
76561198207771700,1665546485,True,"Aside from technical problems which kept me from completing one of the expansions, this game ran pretty well on Windows 10. Holds up well and honestly plays better than most modern shooters"
76561198279452606,1665500795,True,Gaming was better back in the day. Zoomers dont know shit about good games.
76561198260599600,1665499797,True,Pretty good horror old school game. 10/10
76561198095263665,1665494435,True,"F.E.A.R. is a horror FPS game made by Monolith, who also made the spy action game No One Lives Forever, a hidden gem. You play as the Point Man, a soldier in the First Encounter Assault Recon unit with enhanced reflexes, enabling slow-mo as you fight the enemies. While the game seems to start mundane, weird things start to happen, and it gets more intense towards the end.

The game is... honestly kinda bland. You fight just using guns and grenades. The only unique mechanic is the slow-mo, which can be turned on or off at will. And for a horror game, I find it weird that most of the time you'll just be fighting enemy soldiers, the normal, weapon-wielding kind, not some mind-controlled zombies. It would be cooler if there are more enemy types, especially paranormal ones. The levels also feel very monotonous, just plain-colored hallways after another. Story isn't very strong, and gets pretty exciting near the end. But then it ends, kinda abruptly. No boss fights or anything, kinda took me by surprise.

I played NOLF earlier this year, and it was such a unique game, I loved it. Too bad I can't say the same for F.E.A.R., which to me feels kinda like a generic shooter with horror elements here and there. It would feel more like a horror game if there are levels with more similar atmosphere to the ones near the end. However, I think this game is still worth a try, and honestly I love the slow-mo shooting."
76561198335174618,1665470321,True,"Still a great game, i would strongly recommend that you search the discussions in community, find the patch to fix the framerate. 
i have a great PC and still needed the patch. It is basically an old directX input file that you replace in the games files and it fixes the issues.
In terms of gameplay, it is an FPS with horror in it. Very odd mixture, done pretty well in the first half, but the second part really loses it's ambience and leans more into the shooting aspect. Kind of a letdown, though there are still scares to be had, they are not as well done and you can sort of see the creators running out of creative ways to spook you.
All in all, i still love it, i just see it's flaws more with age and the release of many other well-done horror games and unique scares."
76561198164092961,1665469282,True,Solid shoot game
76561198128596313,1665457412,True,One of the best and most fun FPS games i've ever had the pleasure of playing.

76561197976496921,1665359652,True,"I played this game many, many years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. After playing the opening sequences again today it only reminded me why I played it. It doesn't require reading an entire manual to even start the game and it's atmospherics and music simply keeps you involved and on the edge."
76561198343457795,1665342685,True,Amazing
76561198189787078,1665341418,True,awesome game would play again
76561199355640017,1665332490,True,"F.E.A.R. generally holds up pretty well. The enemy AI is still fantastic. It can be quite challenging at times if that's something you're looking for. If you're a fan of horror from this era (Condemned, The Darkness, Dead Space, etc.) F.E.A.R. would be a fantastic addition to your library. 

I played this on my Steam Deck. To elaborate what ""playable"" means here, it runs smoothly with no noticeable frame rate drops or anything. You'll just have to remap some controls, as the default are decidedly not good for playing. Joystick sensitivity is a bit of an issue. By default, it's extremely high, and figuring out the right level did take some trial and error. Overall, still great on SD."

76561198122884898,1665329631,True,The gun play is like nothing else I have played it's an amazing game give it a go if you got nothing to play.
76561197967449126,1665328499,True,"F.E.A.R. has aged very well. It mixes horror and shooter elements nicely but after the first hour or so, focuses more on the shooter side until about the last half hour. There's always the element of horror but it's not very spooky/scary outside of the start and end of the game. That being said, the shooting is solid and the AI actually feels very smart, smarter than most AI in modern games today. If anything, it makes me realize how bad modern AI has become. I do wish they focused more on the horror side but the game was still enjoyable all the way through.

As for the expansions, I didn't play Perseus Mandate, the idea didn't really appeal to me and I haven't heard many good things anyway. I did try Extraction Point but it appears to be broken on modern machines, shame. There's no widescreen support so you have to edit the config files, which isn't a big deal. But I get no sound at all from the game. I tried multiple fixes online, none of them worked. Reading into it, there seem to be other problems with Extraction Point beyond the audio bugs so maybe it's a blessing in disguise that my issues were right from the first minute of the game rather than a later mission refusing to load which also seems to be a problem..."

76561197968660414,1665024991,True,"Original FEAR has all the best elements of a shooter, sprint, crouch, lean, ADS, slowmo, melee, and even a flying kick move. The health boxes, ammo/guns lying everywhere, destructible environments, exploding barrels, fire extinguishers, clone armies, and graphical simplicity. It's endearing and reminiscent of old-school shooters. FEAR has some good uniqueness in its weapons, gameplay, story, and atmosphere. It plays much like Doom with a horror atmosphere and keeps you moving with fast-paced shooting and better weapons. It's a bit of a gem."
76561198192289606,1665023209,True,"Missed out on this game back in the ps3 days despite the hype. Got the bundle on sale for 8 bucks to finally experience it and already, even being a nearly 20 year old game, (still cant believe its been that long and the the ps3 came out almost 20 years ago!)  even though i dont have alot of time into it yet I gotta say it definitely holds up and im already hooked. Gameplay mechanics are ""dated"" I guess you can say, but actually better then the games of the time (theres actually lean mechanics, from 2005!) 

one thing to note that had me frustrated at 1st. in order to get it to actually launch and not crash your entire pc, you have to run in compatibility mode with windows xp, service pack 3. I also had to unplug my logitech g29, dont know if that really made a difference or not but something to note. there are also framerate fixes out there, simple dll file you have to download and extract into the games root folder, as this game is locked at 30fps. it also dont have native support for any modern resolutions, but DOES have the option to change them, up to 4k. 

I feel these issues should have been patched and addressed to run out of the box no problems, as games on gog already has such patches applied to most if not all of their old games so you dont have to dig for and configure work arounds, but i guess it is what it is. just something to be aware of it most likely WILL NOT RUN PROPERLY OR AT ALL out of the box. However once it is running correctly, its a great game and worth a pickup, especially on a good sale."

The fire fights were just on point, it is super quiet one moment, and before you know it, smoke, shattered glass, every wall is riddled with bullet holes, ear drums are ringing, blood is on the walls, all in the span of 3 seconds, and you don't even know who survived, or if you got hurt. 

The horror aspect of it is really well made too, except for some cheap jump scares, but it ought to scare you at least a few times, and give you chills twice as much. The story is super fascinating as well, and had me interested from start to finish."

Love the little touches that are still great today. like the different foot sounds on various materials and the dust when you blow things up. The graphics are good enough, because they were amazing back in 2005.

It's gameplay is not difficult (I played it through on Hard setting) however it manages to maintain a feeling of tension, with some fun 'oh-shi...' moments.  Gun play is decent for it's era, though suffers from early generation shooter quirks, also that the starting weapon can pretty much carry you through the entire game.

Recommended to those who enjoy vibes over glossy graphics."

Can give you a few creeps, but won't ruin your experience, if you don't like the horror genre. Story is quite good too. Gunplay is absolutely legendary, kudos to VK-12, my love. Environment destructability in this game is outstanding, after a gunfight you get the feeling, that there was an actual gunfight here. Also the AI(of course), it really makes fights interesting.

Plus, the guns are great to play with (the double pistol is unusually OP), and their sound effects are excellent for a game of its time. Also, the jumpscares got me real good. They even made me fire wildly at the ghosts!

However, some of the maps, such as Unauthorized Personnel, leave much to be desired. The horror aspect is also not very remarkable since it relies too much on the atmosphere to put the player on edge. Another flaw worth noting is the reload animations, which look like the protagonist molesting the weapons instead of reloading them. 

Overall, a rock-solid FPS with some flaws, but I'm sure they won't ruin your experience of F.E.A.R!"

Strengths:
> Really cool and scary atmosphere (almost reminds me of the backrooms or liminal spaces at times)
> Amazing tactical gunplay (rivals even games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R)
> Nice and complex story/lore
> Aged amazingly well with graphics that still hold up relatively well (mostly thanks to the lighting)

Weaknesses:
> Level design can get repetitive
> Story takes a while to get going

Overall, I would strongly recommend F.E.A.R especially if you enjoy atmospheric games and immersing yourself in worlds, The gameplay is some of the best i've ever played, even amongst modern games which really speaks to how well the game has aged on the whole."
76561199206556261,1664753149,True,"Pros: One of the best and most influential games of all time, one of the few games that can be a power fantasy without downgrading the horror. A developer sold their soul for the lighting engine and it shows

However, what lacks in visuals, it more than makes up in gameplay. Solid shooting mechanics, enemies are actually smart, they flank you they create cover they communicate with each other call for reinforcements etc. There are also some horror moments but they are sprinkled throughout the game in such a manner that you are lulled into a sense of security so when one of these moments occurs, it will have the maximum effect.

Headphones are highly recommended, however, make sure they are wireless as you will jump out of your seat and the wired ones might not like it. Speaking from experience."

76561198157743733,1664702452,True,"FEAR was the most anticipated FPS game in 2005, coming in a year after Half Life 2. Does it deliver? Yes, yes it does.

Taking inspiration of the #1 horror movies of the era, The Ring and The Grudge there is a lot of spookiness going on. FEAR is also one of very few games that does slow motion bullet time very well, and possibly the only first person game that does it well.

The game mixes great storytelling, horror and action is a beautiful mix that keeps you on edge.

GAMEPLAY and IMMERSION

This game is amazing because of gameplay and immersion. There is truly no other game like FEAR which has excellent audio, excellent enemy AI, impactful weapons, extraordinary lighting and particle effects as well as cool locations in an indoor setting. You feel alone, but have your radio communication on, as well as finding telephones and computers to get information from.

AI

I have no idea why, but the enemy AI in FEAR, a game that's pushing 20 years old, has the best enemy AI in small spaces I have ever seen. What happened?! The AI just kick ass and work in teams to destroy you, talking to each other during combat. Each encounter is memorable and plays out differently each time you play. What other game does that?!

In conclusion this game is just amazingly epic and there's no FPS game quite like it. Many fans of early FPS games rank this one as one of the greatest out there, right a long Half Life 2, and the old timers like Doom and Quake. It's scary, but mostly it's just action in a dark setting, and it absolutely rocks!

76561198045472596,1664699951,False,"It's more of a shooter than a horror game by far. Needs a fair amount of work to get running well. Not particularly fun, certainly not scary."
76561198158415518,1664693110,True,"Edit:
The game is very short tho
----------------------------------------
The game really resembles half-life and killing floor. 
It feels weird saying that a 2005 game is old but in terms of present day graphics and gameplay, I guess it is. I used to be so scared of any type of horror games especially during when games like fear, silent hill, amnesia came out. But playing this now, it doesn't hit the same anymore. Maybe because I'm a 23 year old bum who constantly watched how games are developed and you can kinda predict when jump scares appear and how levels are designed. But the graphics and old va just reminds me of half-life and it makes me feel so happy, I don't know how to describe the feeling but it's good.

I just bought this game and I'm having a blast. Just a side note if you're having an fps issue, you might need to install a mod that fixes that. It certainly helped me."

What I enjoyed the most about this game is ironically enough the enemy AI. This game is ancient and yet the AI behaves smarter and performs better than the overwhelming majority of modern shooters. They will run off to flank you, use cover smartly, blind-fire, vault railings, coordinate... It was worth it just to experience the AI, oddly enough."
76561198169757291,1664684840,True,"Very tense game, with satisfying mechanics and gameplay. While it does not have modern down the sights aiming and the mouse sensitivity starts off rather high its a very satisfying time to fight off squads of cloned soldiers in industrialized corporation environments. I personally like the graphics of the game, as they are in that inbetween of modern and old. When seeing outside buildings from the maps they look blocked out like something from deus ex, and the indoors have very well done dynamic lights to them. the bump mapping also helps to contribute to the feel of the game, overall the lighting and graphics help to maintain an actual feeling of fear and anxiety the tense firefights had me crouching behind walls peaking over waiting for the enemy to turn the corner and unload a mag on me. If you want thrills and fun this is the game for you, don't even have to worry about performance issues either unless you're running on a really old family computer."

[i]Be your own action movie star while dodging paranormal forces in this action-packed, horror-themed shooter.[/i]

[b]Story[/b]
A mysterious paramilitary force infiltrates a multi-billion dollar aerospace compound, taking hostages but issuing no demands. The government responds by sending in a Special Forces team only to have them obliterated. Live footage of the massacre shows an inexplicable wave of destruction tearing the soldiers apart. With no other recourse, the elite F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) team is assembled to deal with the extraordinary circumstances. They are given one simple mission: Evaluate the threat and eliminate the intruders at any cost.

Turns out the invading paramilitary force is actually an army of manufactured replica clones under the control of Paxton Fettel, a rogue operative with psychic, mind-control abilities. The hunt for Pattel leads the F.E.A.R. team to a classified underground facility where research into psychic abilities for the purposes of warfare have been carried out. The player, the unnamed F.E.A.R. team’s point-man becomes stalked by an entity known as Alma - one of the test subjects of the facility with immense psychic powers who manifests as a little girl in a red dress and as a disfigured woman in psychic hallucinations throughout the story.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
The gunplay is very fun and the mechanics here feel solid. Combat is fast and snappy and even though the game is quite old, I was impressed at the graphical and particle effects in use. The blood spray from enemies and gun smoke from walls and other surfaces does a great deal for the immersion factor. Everything works well together and the player is always provided with many options concerning combat.

In terms of weaponry, F.E.A.R provides a concise selection of guns, three of which the player can carry at once. From a selection of machine guns, a solid shotgun, dual pistols, and a variety of explosives, there's plenty to mix and match with.

Also available for the player is the use of reflex mode - a brief ability to slow down time, similar to the gameplay of Max Payne. This is especially helpful when dealing with large groups of enemies and generally increases the awesomeness factor all round. The reflex bar recharges over time and can definitely be abused, making the game relatively easy even on harder difficulties, but the mechanic is so cool you won’t be able to resist.

There is a handful of enemy variations including your standard military grunt, heavily-armoured forces, combat mechs, and supernatural entities and even though the 6ish hour campaign is a fairly linear romp through dark and gritty industrial and office environments, there's enough branching paths and set pieces so that it rarely gets stale.

[b]Review[/b]
Fun and fluid pretty much sums up the 1st person shooter gameplay of F.E.A.R. The expansive arsenal of weapons and explosives, the kung-fu melee attacks, and the slow-motion mechanic make for an engaging shooter experience that the developers nailed.

As mentioned earlier, throughout the course of the game the player experiences psychic hallucinations, partly as a means for Fettel to deliver cryptic exposition and to tie in much of the horror aesthetic in the form of scares and creepy scenery shifts. It blends into the gameplay nicely and gives the player the feeling of being on edge as they never know what to expect next.

Also noteworthy in building the horror aesthetic was the game's soundtrack. It features many decent tracks to facilitate the intense firefights and the main menu theme (which also plays during the story) became an instant horror ambience favourite of mine. It perfectly embodies the high-tech, paranormal theme of the game and sends chills down your spine every time."

%60 of this game takes place in an brightly lit office building with little to no variation in aesthetics. I have absolutely no nostalgia for this game so I can safely say that if you do decide to pick this up play for like 2-3 hours and put it down.

17 years ago I played the downloadable demo for this. I probably played it 100 times over even though my PC at the time could barely run it. I had to adjust the settings to find a balance that was worthy to the eye and still playable.  I ended up buying a retail copy of the game as soon as it released. To this day, it is still the best solo experience I've ever had in an FPS game. The Sci-fi horror element is legit, but I was more in it for the combat as the AI is still the most impressive I've seen. I'll never get over how they made clone soldiers feel more life-like and personable than any other AI TO DATE. The way they communicate and operate in fire teams will send shivers up your spine. They will call out when they see your flashlight, when you switch between cover they will actually identify what it is you're hiding behind. They will always lay down a stream of cover fire for each other. They will not fire if they are blocking each others cone of fire. They flank, crawl under obstacles, throw grenades to flush you out. If you kill members of the fire team, they will actually fall back to positions that don't allow you to flank them. The damage to the environment and enemy models is something I still haven't seen in many other shooters. Sometimes after fire fights you have to wait for the dust to clear to see the aftermath of the battle. 

It's not perfect. It has flaws, but during a time when games had to be different to stand out from generic run of the mill COD clones, F.E.A.R absolutely delivered in a way that always brings me back to it."

76561198027367717,1663282785,True,"I love this game. I am not afraid to call out shooters like Half-Life and Return to Castle Wolfenstein for actually not really being all that great. I will admit Half-Life's intro sequence is iconic, it actually is amazing and I was around in 1999 to bear witness to it. But what else? What does it really have to offer? Many of the big levels are terrible (Xen, On A Rail) and the combat is weak. The weapons lack impact, the monsters are dull and there's lots of cheap deaths. The game doesn't sound or look all that great either and the atmosphere comes and goes. A brilliant moment here and there, interspersed by lots of the mundane.

With any game, I always ask myself, what is great about it. What is that thing it does that sets it apart from the rest - a distinct reason to play THAT game. Some games have more than one of such a thing. Fear is one those games. This is a shooter that was admired for its graphics back in 2005. Now it's 2022 and often times the sands of time will grind that sort of visual appeal to a pulp. But Fear STILL LOOKS AMAZING. This game needs to be played on a monitor with deep blacks and high contrast for the right experience, preferably at a seriously high resolution. Massive black shadows, tasteful minimalist color combinations and discrete but extremely effective lighting make up the levels. There are frequently scenes where the big blacks and bright white shades come together to give the game an almost monochromatic look, sometimes broken up by cool blue paint or yellow railings. It's supersleek elegant looking. When the action suddenly breaks out, it's almost as if your screen explodes. I've never seen another shooter that handles color this way.  In the modern era there are surely other games that look great, but for me, what really blows me away is just how distinct Fear is in its beauty. It's so unique and clever. The visuals work perfectly with Fear's horror elements and combine with very good audio to provide an amazing cinematic atmosphere.

The combat is also a delight. The tools you have, combined with the clever map layouts and stealth, make it possible to get the drop on enemies. Slow Mo gives you a fighting chance when you need to break out. The environment isn't out to screw you by dropping you in bottomless pits or blowing up a gas pipe right in your face (be prepared to be scared though!). What I'm saying is the game feels fair. You don't just get one-shot for no reason. Engagements are often tactical battles as much as tests of accuracy and quickness, though ofcourse you'll benefit greatly from excelling at those, too. The tactical element though means it's possible to get hit a few times and recover. You don't need to rely on quicksaves if you play smart. In fact, I advise to adopt a ""check point only"" style of play, to prevent save scumming. Trust me, it really brings out the thrills in this game, because now, engagements are all or nothing. You either win, or you LOSE. And because fights have a bit of a duration to them, the tension can really build. You couldn't really do this in games like Half-Life or Blood, because at any time something can and probably will end you without cause. But it's perfectly doable in Fear.

This is a gem. It's one of those games where all the individual elements are incredibly good by themselves but then they also combine to create something that's even greater than the sum of its parts. Whether you're talking about the complexity of the levels, the pacing of new weapons and equipment, the design of the encounters; it's very obvious when you play Fear that strenuous hours were put into getting these things right. Even in 2022, this is highly playable, highly enjoyable. It feels modern. This is the sort of game that sincerely veers into the territory of art and as such I suspect that it will probably never feel outdated. 10/10"

76561198012129790,1662936274,True,"So for this Throwback Thursday, the newest member of the FULLSYNC team brings you a retrospective review of one of his favourite games, F.E.A.R.

Debuting in 2005, F.E.A.R. made a lasting impact on the action-horror genre using Monolith’s
latest game engine (Jupiter EX) at the time. Still standing up today, the game raised the bar of action-
horror to new heights during its release. From sneaking round in the dimly lit corridors to full-on firefights
with enemies around every corner the game did a wonderful job of immersing the player in its
world. Even today there is still a certain experience that you get from playing F.E.A.R. that has not really
been replicated.



Starting off with a capture mission, the player quickly becomes the last remaining member of their
squadron. After discovering what they are capable of, the game has them beginning to question who
they really are and what their purpose is. Suddenly the player finds themselves alone, traversing dark
and unknown territory. Pitted up against a hive mind of soldiers controlled by a single mysterious man,
the player is forced to fight alone. There are a plethora of handy weapons at the player’s disposal, each
having its own advantage and playstyle. This paired with some of the abilities in the game makes for
creative and engaging combat. Ominous music and unnerving sounds make the player feel uneasy.
Meanwhile encounters with the horrifying “Alma” instill fear into the mind of the player.

One of F.E.A.R.’s strongest achievements is its deceivingly simple AI system. The enemy soldiers
in the game all share one collective mind and move in accordance with one another. This system forces
the player to react to the enemies’ calls and movements creating fast-paced and engaging gameplay.
F.E.A.R. has rightly been praised both then and now for its unique AI design and implementation, which
remains a standout in the FPS landscape still today.



F.E.A.R’s gameplay has a few minor faults, but none that take away from the overall experience
of the game in any significant way. One of F.E.A.R’s minor faults is its rather ordinary level design. Most
of the levels have a very similar layout: the player traverses bland offices and cubicles in most of the
game. Moreover, the finer details of the plot are buried in long text and voicemails, making it tedious for
the player to uncover and understand the finer details of the story. While these few things may provide
some annoyance, they are outclassed by the other aspects of the game. When it comes down to it,
F.E.A.R. is a shining example of exactly what is expected from a strong action-horror title.

The TL;DR:

Immersive atmosphere
Fast-paced, engaging gameplay
Masterful AI
Intriguing plot
Mediocre level design

Tl;dr - Great shootout mechanics help elevate F.E.A.R. over its narrative and gameplay flaws. Where FEAR falters in the horror-sphere it more than makes up for as an action game. While I don’t believe it’s worth the full $55.00 asking price (side note- anyone else surprised that a title as old as FEAR hasn’t gone down in cost compared to contemporary AAA games?), if you can get it on a discount you’ll find an enjoyable diversion. While others have criticized the level structure for being repetitive, I think the overall gameplay and mood makes up for these flaws. Just make sure you change the default keyboard binding as it is really un-ergonomic. My personal recommendation? Shift to slow-mo, ctrl to crouch, C for medkits, F for interact, G for grenade, and right-click for flashlight (admittedly used a second right button on my mouse and right for melee, but if you don’t have that remember that melee is pretty useless outside of breaking down the occasional barrier)."

This is a great game and worth playing 17 years later, the gameplay holds up really well and the graphics are still good enough to make each environment feel immersive. The artificial intelligence of FEAR is really it's claim to fame because of how well the clone soldiers were programmed; they feel like human opponents. They flank, use cover and make call outs which works really well in the narrow corridors and office spaces the game takes place in. Finally the horror is serviceable, while never amazing there were a few places in this game that got me good because of it's imaginative horror set pieces.

Just to start off, modern machines may have some FPS issues playing this game.  The file many sites and threads refer to is unreachable so it took me a while but I found the necessary file to fix it then it ran brilliantly. You can find it in the link below (and yes you should modify random .dll files because it can cause major issues with your PC but I tested this one myself and it works with no adverse effects).

The game itself is still very fun and holds up quite well as a horror/thriller shooter. Long quiet corridors, lights fading, grizzly scenes of violence.  All work well to creep you out.  Slap on a pair of headphones and turn off the lights you'll see what I mean.  2005 saw a lot of good looking games for their time and in my opinion this one stands proud among the other horror shooters at the time. It wasn't the best of the year though, that honour belongs to Resident Evil 4. It's also one of the few games you can actually see your legs! Not only see by USE!  Close combat is actually viable in this game with a jumping melee attack basically being a double kick or roundhouse with instantly kills most enemies.  Every gun can also be used as a melee weapon, the bigger the gun the bigger the bonk.

The story starts with an interesting premise: a Psychic Commander controlling Clone Soldiers has gone a bit wacky and has gone rogue, your typical third party secret weapons program gone wrong. In this case it's Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) (basically Umbrella).  You need go in and whoop his ass.  Once you get there though it starts to get kinda odd.  I'm not going to spoil the story here, just going to say they use the ambiance very well.  The game can get very creepy and not with jump scares.  Eerie corridors and things in the corner of your vision mess with you.  If you like to be a little anxious, you will enjoy.

The enemies in the game are the Clone bois, and they do not mess around. They come at you hard and they are precise, even on normal it can prove to be a challenge by using cover and grenades to get you to shift. If you get the jump on them you could head shot 1 guy down but then you will be swarmed. Your health and body armour amount to tissue paper, though you can find them around the map quite easily they really don't last long and they both deplete simultaneously.  You could have 0 health with armour left!  You also need to actively use your Medkits, they don't auto consume when you hit zero.

As much as I do love this game from my early gaming days I do have a couple of critiques. 

The enemy types are limited, basically: regular dude with either shotgun or rifle, a super heavy and a stealth sneaky boi.  You'll also occasionally bump into a robot but that's about it. 

The weapon choice is decent but you have basically 3 guns you will want on you at all times (because that's all you can carry, if you find a new 4th gun you'll need to drop another). The main rifle, stake launcher and Particle Beamer, all the other ones are basically pointless.  The ammo for these will be readily available while the other powerful weapons will be much harder to find.  I'm a big fan of the Shotgun in any horror game (mostly because it's a very effective panic fire if something jumps out right in front of you by surprise and you turn it into kibbles). But in this game most of your engagements are at medium to long range where a shotgun lacks significantly.  The enemy shotguns on the other hand can snipe you.  

All in all the game definitely holds up and is worth your time if you want to visit the days of old shooters and get your spoopy on. I give it a 6.5/10"

76561198045122767,1660996937,True,"After 17 years, FEAR is still stands as an extremely unique entry in the shooter genre, especially for its time. The worst part about FEAR in 2022 is just getting to purchase it since you're forced to buy it terrible sequels alongside it for a higher price.

The amount of dust and debris thats kicked up in the otherwise stale environments is visually amazing during gunfights against AI that, technically, arent that much better than normal AI in a shooter but the way they communicate and interact with said environment is what makes them impressive.

Will require some tweaking to get it working right in 2022, but once you get it going its an incredibly solid shooter. Highly recommend it. My first experience playing FEAR was on the Xbox 360 back in the day and its just as good as it was then. Its a shame that the Dual Machine Pistols & Automatic Shotgun from the 360 & PS3 versions of FEAR Files were never made available to the PC Version. The Auto Shotgun wouldve especially have been fun to play with.

-----

I just beat Extraction Point and what can I say but its more FEAR? Finishes off the little bit of loose ends at the end of the main campaign, adds some new weapons and enemy types. More fun environments to shoot up. Its also great! 

Unfortunately though, it seems to have had more issues getting to work than FEAR itself did with me having to turn down the graphics to Medium rather than Maximum for half the game or else Id get ""Disconnected From Server"" error messages. Changing the resolution was also trickier but not by much, having to change an INI file rather than the game just supporting it outright.

But yeah I mean, if you like FEAR continue it with Extraction Point! Took me about 3 1/2 hours to beat.

-----

Perseus Mandate switches it up with you taking control of ""The Sergeant"", another character on a second FEAR team deployed to a different area of the city. For some reason, he has the same ""unnatural reflexes""(slow-mo) that Pointman does. Immediately off the bat the level design from FEAR & EP has been changed for larger arenas to fight in, which should be good as itd change up the feeling from those mentioned, but they almost completely lack anything interesting in them and look extremely boring for the most part. That trend is continued for most of the game, apart from some moments where youll be fighting through offices again.

Speaking of fighting, they added new enemies in the form of a Merc group called the ""Nightcrawlers"", and their name is lame but the year was 2007 so Ill give it a break. What I wont give a break is that they really just are Replica except with a new shiny rifle that has a scope, and some really annoying prick of an enemy that bounces off walls and can dash. The Nightcrawlers also fail to emulate that level of ""communication"" that the Replica have with what feels like less callouts and reactions to their environment, either that or Im missing it as their voiceover is a generic deep voiced dude and you can hardly hear it most of the time theyre speaking, unlike the Replica's loud radio chatter.

There is also one other new enemy, which is just some black fog that appears on the ground and pulls you into it when you walk over it dealing damage. Its lame, really boring, and generally just not a fun addition. They often place it in areas where you have to walk over it or the hit detection is in favour of it and it deals free damage.

The story isnt anything to write home about either, youre a second FEAR team deployed to an Armachan Data Center which then sets you on a wild goose chase against the Nightcrawlers who want to steal Alma's DNA. I think the more interesting part about it is that it takes places starting about 2/3rds of the way through the main game, and halfway through PM the Nuke will go off and Replica will be shut off for a bit like in EP. Youll traverse through an area you went through in EP as well, probably just missing Pointman when he went through there. I thought that was neat.

Honestly, PM could probably be skipped unless youre like me and REALLY wanted more FEAR that isnt 2 or 3. Its only 3-4 hours long anyway so it wont keep you long, I beat it in a sitting."

There's a lot to like here and if your into shooters with horror elements you should pick this game up. Please play on the highest difficulty to get the most out of the gunplay. You can tell the game was designed around this level of challenge in almost every aspect. Difficulty comes from smart opponents that use the tools and environment at their disposal instead of being bullet sponges that 1 shot you. Although there is the horror aspect to FEAR I didn't feel like it was intrusive or slapped together for the sake of it. Its well done overall and gave me consistent chills. The environments and lighting are incredible and come together to create interesting gun fights and horror sections. While the game is visually drab and bleak it sets an appropriate tone. I only wish there was more variety in the world. You'll fight through a ton of office spaces and industrial areas and it tends to wear you down.

76561198047719458,1660481251,True,"This is going, in some ways, to be a retrospective review based on the original First Encounter Assault Recon and its expansions.

Back in the 2000's I've got this game and, slightly later, both Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. I do remember that I used to have a lot of fun with it, especially with cheats. Enemies were quite a bit smarter than in Quake SP and Serious Sam. Also, the games definitely had the horror element in them as well which made then-preteen me to startle at some moments. I did replay the original game in 2015, but have forgotten some details. Fast forward to 2022...

While playing Blood: Fresh Supply, I decided to check the list of Monolith games. The game was right in it (with expansions belonging to Vivendi). Getting to know this, I thought - maybe it's time to relive my memories with the FEAR? And I decided that, hell yeah, why not.

Playing through all three original FEARs, here's what I can tell about them...

[h1]First Encounter Assault Recon: The Beginning[/h1]
Obviously beginning with the game that started it all, I've got a solid story to experience. It begins quite simply - you're a Pointman in the squad, transferred into the Auburn District to find a dangerous criminal, Paxton Fettel. As you progress through the game, you begin to notice quite a lot of paranormal events happening around the area, majority of them being connected to Armacham Corporation. 
Even further, everything you uncover through either the cutscenes, characters or video logs interconnects into quite a plotline which does makes sense, revolving around the main threat of this game - Alma - and why everything happens the way it is shown.

With a respectable storyline, what I can say about the game proper? Let's see...
[b]Horror elements[/b]: I won't say that they're a nightmare fuel material as a whole, but they're well done. Sometimes they're just there for a scare jump, but what I'm going to say that in the last several levels they're in their best - and incidentally, these are also the ones I do remembered quite well through the time.
[b]""Smart AI"" and enemy balance[/b]: the enemies aren't as smart as I remember them being, but through careful uses of script they still make the same impact they had on me in my childhood. They also respond to your actions, like being flanked or killing their teammates. And in a good way, because you can actually hear the fear in a sole survivor of the squad, as he calls for reinforcements in panic while covering in panic near a fringe in some office. This is still a strong point of the game, as you can believe in enemies. 
They are also not OP compared to similar enemies from other games of that time. You won't get instakilled by a SMG shot from a sniper distance, nor you get into CoD4: Grenade Warfare situation with endless grenade storms. Powered Armor soldiers, despite being dumb,  can be believed to be shot attractors, while meanwhile the actual squad tries to corner you into corner with suppression fire. Which actually counts as a tactic.
Fully robotic enemies are my least favourite of them because they either just shoot or bullrush you. What also is bad is that there's not too much variety of them.
[b]Weapon gameplay[/b]: What I like is that every gun is useful. While you can hoard Prototype Rifle and Rocket Launcher with ammo glitch, you don't need to, because even a assault rifle can make a difference. Impact from weapons feels mostly alright, with the sole exception being a shotgun.
The shotgun in question feels weak, yet is so ridiculously random even without the ammo glitch that you're going to use it for quite a while - it sometimes fails to even scratch an enemy, while sometimes it blows them into bloody clouds on medium distance. A truly paranormal gun.
There's also some close combat stuff relating to legs, hands and weapon stocks, but it works only on regular enemies.
All three explosives work wonders, with mines being my favourite for their principle of activation.
[b]Sound design[/b]: This game has a good sound design relating to weapons and enemies, and decent relating to music. My personal favourite design from here would be Powered Armor soldier's.
[b]Characters[/b]: They're mostly alright. Whom I do remember better than others are Harlan Wade, Alma, Paxton and the Armacham hacker who likes to eat some fast food while running away. Voice acting is good.
[b]Graphics[/b]: In 2005, they were really good. But I don't really think they stood the test of time, as they definitely show their age by now.
[b]Level design[/b]: The weakest point for me. Most of the game is this - docks, warehouses, offices, abandoned structures, tunnels, with little variation. But I gotta say that, along with horror elements, there was an improvement in the last several levels.
[b]Bugs[/b]: Didn't encounter any bug. Monolith actually made sure that this game worked flawlessly even on Windows 10, with improvements allowing it to work in 3440x1440 instead of 1280x1024.

[h1]Extraction Point: Former Impressions Ruined[/h1]
After completing the original game, I decided to continue the story by delving into expansion packs. Compared to the original game, I remembered next to nothing out of them both. The first one... delivered the following:
[b]Horror elements[/b]: EP followed suit of the original game in horror department. And this was the best point of the expansion pack, especially the last horror segments.
[b]Enemies[/b]: Game introduced only one semi-new enemy, with the rest being rehashed from the original game. Tactics don't change.
[b]Weapon gameplay[/b]: New weapons (laser and minigun) feel weak, with laser being super-disappointing, that's what I'm going to say on this matter. But hey, you can open the doors now with melee attacks.
[b]Sound design[/b]: Everything originating from EP sounds worse than in original FEAR
[b]Characters[/b]: This is the moment when I laughed about the characters. With the only exception of Pattel, I can say that the characters are almost steadfast in their talks. In a bad way.
[b]Graphics[/b]: The same as in FEAR
[b]Level design[/b]: The worst parts in FEAR are better than in EP. While it's more varied than before, almost all levels either feel too big, overloaded or too empty. The subway system and hospital are prime examples of this. At some points it feels like I've launched Half-Life 1 and not a game from 2005. The very last level was alright though, because of ending.
[b]Bugs[/b]: EP is loaded with bugs, including game-breaking bugs, and sound bugs. And in the entire package, EP is the only thing I still had to play in 1280x1024 because Monolith didn't care.

[h1]Perseus Mandate: More Fun, Yet Not A Fear[/h1]
Extraction Point was tedious, so I didn't have too much hope in Perseus Mandate. But here's what I had.
[b]Horror elements[/b]: Perseus Mandate heavily toned down the horror, to the point that it wasn't First Encounter Assault Recon anymore.
[b]Enemies[/b]: A new faction, an over-the-top combination of existing vanilla enemies.
[b]Weapon gameplay[/b]: Compared to EP, new weapons were MUCH better than the vanilla weapons. Otherwise the same as in EP.
[b]Sound design[/b]: That organization felt like aliens undercover, quite fitting for XCOM actually; the weapons sounded bad
[b]Characters[/b]: Voice acting is much better than in EP, with your allies being decent guys. The enemy organization is too funny to take seriously.
[b]Graphics[/b]: In 2006, this wasn't a gaming edge anymore. Lighting is bad. And new weapons look horrible!
[b]Level design[/b]: only slightly better than in EP
[b]Bugs and improvements[/b]: quite a lot less bugs than in EP, so I enjoyed the pack a lot more than EP

To conclude: yes, you'll get the entire package. But play only the original game, which is what I recommend. Perseus Mandate is more action-driven, but isn't FEAR really. Extraction Point if you want horror elements and Point Man's conclusion - but be ready for boringdom and galore of bugs."

The positive is mostly the enemy AI which seems quite advanced for a game of that era and the level layouts which makes the game feel more real.

But the game is a pain to run on modern systems. The bugs and stutters and a lot of stuff contribute to making setting up this game a nightmare.

Still a fantastic game to play right through from start to end. The gun play is great and the ""bullet-time"" feature makes mowing down the enemy a lot more fun. 

Installing the DirectX fix (you'll find it somewhere in the steam forums) is a must on new systems, else expect issues. 

Would highly recommend playing and following it up with FEAR 2."

76561198027491283,1659077390,True,"By my standards this is not a horror game, but it is still damn good action FPS, where enemy AI is not completely brainless, as in post 2015 and AAA games.

Many jump scares are easily to miss if you are too busy looking around for health boosts instead of looking where the ""spoopy stuff"" is happening.

Music is like from a good B action movie, there are some interesting level design choices and passable voice acting. You will need to download a fix to run this on a modern machine, and remember - if you get ""Disconnected from server"" message, just reload the game, drop everything to lowest settings, then play around display resolution until it lets you get further in the level, then save and put everything back to Maximum as before. Only happened to me once though."
76561198096590906,1659064026,True,FEAR used to scare the shit out of me as a kid. Even as an adult it is a pretty spooky action shooter. This is a very satisfying game and was way ahead of its time. The game isn't very long but it's an awesome experience. Beware the game might crash on modern systems. Also GOG has it for a much more responsible price!

Visceral gunplay with excellent visual and sound design, epic slow motion implementation, very competent AI system, and dark atmosphere. Simply FPS 101 material for shooter fans to enjoy or for game devs to learn from.

I have no idea why they haven't remastered it, because if they manage to do a decent job, it would sell like hot cakes."

76561198118307853,1658962666,True,"The Good: 
Gameplay is generally ahead of it's time. I often forgot this came out in 2005 while playing. 

The Bad: 
Level design is extremely repetitive and the story is just meh all around. Alma is an extremely uninspired horror figure. Numerous Japanese horror games / movies did this exact character. Alessa Gilespie from Silent Hill comes to mind. On the topic of the title, i feel like they came up with ""First Encounter Assault Recon"" in less than 10 seconds. IMO, it's a super cheesy title. Also, I'm someone who LOVES campy stuff -- but the fat guy was a horrible villain and not particularly funny at all. 

The Overall: 
The game is ok."
76561198072051442,1658955285,True,"Still one of the very best FPS ever made. Still looks and plays great too. Sound is amazing with some really great music at points. Good jump scares. The bad part is you have to buy all three to get it. 

Played it back on the day on Xbox and pc, recently purchased the whole series here for cheap in the sale."
76561198114560966,1658949620,True,I still play through all the Fear games once every few years. Amazing games and awesome storyline
76561198134584565,1658914584,True,"Great shooter, but unstable AF"
76561198114676420,1658873280,True,"A gem from its time period. It suffers from the same problems that other games suffer from back then that are on Steam. You have to look up how to fix certain issues like changing the resolution for modern displays, audio issues, etc.; It can be solved within 5-10 mins, there's multiple YouTube videos explaining how to do so. But once you get the game working it's a blast, I'm not a huge horror fan, and the game isn't trying to go for a horror genre. It's like a psychological thriller. The gameplay is great, the shooting and ragdoll physics are amazing. There really isn't a game that I can say aged this well and feels this good in today's day and age. Haven't finished the expansions yet, but they have the same issues as the base game. But I look forward to what the other games are like. Would definitely recommend buying this if you enjoy playing older games, responsive gun fights, and enjoy single-player games. Even better if you buy it on sale."
76561198060530840,1658872671,True,"The first thing that impressed me about this game was the AI. My mind was completely blown when the basic enemies would call out to their squad and broadcast my location with various voice lines and try to flank me whenever they had the chance. Combined with the leaning mechanic, it really felt like a proper FPS game. Whenever I got out of a firefight I felt like I had handled it like a pro.
The maps are typically dull, but that is to be expected. There's only so many ways you can arrange a office space or industrial complex to make it suitable for an interesting fight. I found myself getting more excited about the idea of fighting in an area, rather than the area itself.
The story isn't always clear, and certain aspects are missable due to the ""enemy intel"" laptops mechanic. The horror aspect is just OK to me. It won't be anything you haven't seen before, considering how old this game is. Blood all over the place, mysterious voices, dead bodies that get dragged off screen, and little girl ghosts. You know, the basics.

8/10"
76561198446936314,1658810665,True,An awesome classic. It perfected the slo-mo.
76561198198577662,1658772084,True,"Honestly don't know why I didn't try it sooner It's a great game. Only problem is I had to install a patch and run in compatibility mode just to get it to even work. The max settings seem to make it crash as well high/medium didn't have problems though. Def a pain to get it running its definitely an enjoyable game the levels and lighting are better than many games to this day as well as the AI. Def got Half-life vibes with a little bit of horror. If you like half-life you will like this game.

[b] Game Kept Crashing Here's How I Got It Working. [/b]
I had to keep opening it in windowed mode to get it running to find the settings that would work if you are having trouble just put +windowed 1 in launch commands just to get it to start then you can switch to fullscreen, download patch, run compatibility mode for i think xp 2 or 3, disable full screen optimizations, and lower settings a bit and then you should be able to run the game without any problems."
76561198071859410,1658762690,True,"This game still holds up to this date, primarily due to how strategically smart the AI is. They will push down filing cabinets and seek cover while their buddies are flanking you. they are smart, deadly and will not stop. I seriously recommend playing this game even in 2022."
76561199006280697,1658739684,True,"Tl;dr: Game still holds up although some keybinds need to be changed for modernisation. Also stupid that Warner Bros only made available via bundle. Funny that a billion dollar Multi-media corporation still feels the need to scam people.
Graphics/Performance:
Since this is an early 2000's release the many resolutions were not the intended target. If you play in a 1920 x 1080 resolution you will notice that gun recoil and crosshairs feel off in the beginning but you can become used to it. Note things like Anti-Aliasing are not implemented, however the graphics are very good for it's time. PS1 style graphics are already artistically trending again my bets are on mid 2000's graphics to be the following one. [If you do want some quality improvements mod instructions are available via community TAB]. You have a PC with specs from the last 5 years there is no doubt you can likely run on highest settings. There is one caveat with performance being the crashes in some sections or disconnects even if you are playing in the main-story. This can be fixed by lowering all settings to minimum and reloading the area from last saved, then can be restored to previous settings once past the crash point. 
Campaign:
Story is good. As you progress you want to understand both organisations and the motives behind Paxton Fettel's murders. It has that vibe of a nostalgic FPS shooter with dark horror elements fitting with the atmosphere. Some civilian characters are beyond stupid and just feel like a nuisance to sway the plot a certain direction or provide comic relief that doesn't blend well with the overall plot."
76561199125997456,1658716331,True,It kicks ass
76561198295786669,1658632247,True,"Really overrated, but still good. It's just another shooter campaign. Though I was surprised by how smart the enemy AI is compared to most games like this. It's pretty short and feels like the first half of a story, so playing the second is a must. And the whole game is extremely easy, so if you're at all competent at FPS games then be sure to play on max difficulty.

I have spent 3 hours so far running around identical looking grey corridors shooting identical looking bad guys but hey, that's okay when you have a bullet time button that turns every enemy encounter in to a dramatic action movie shootout. Recommended. 

Extraction Point: More of the same but far less inspired. I was enjoying the combat but reached a section in the train station which would repeatedly crash and bump me out of the game. Not Recommended.

Perseus Mandate: More varied combat scenarios and even some variation in the environments makes this a good addition to the game. I was really quite enjoying Perseus Mandate up until I encountered more crashes - around about interval 6 it just kept bumping me back to the main menu like in Extraction Point. Would be a Recommended if it wasn't for this!

Overall, as a package, I would Recommended F.E.A.R when its on deep sale (which it is frequently). The gun play is a lot of fun thanks to the bullet-time//slow motion mechanic. The crashes on the expansion pack content were disappointing and soured the overall experience. If you like this era of first person shooters and as long as you don't pay full price, I think there is fun to be had here"

76561198026009494,1657725071,True,"This game is a gem from yesteryear without doubt.

If you install the DirectInputFpsFix_v1_0 patch and open the zip file and copy the dinput8.dll file into the F.E.A.R (in Steam/Steamapps/Common) steam folder then your frame rate is fixed and goes from about 12 to like 1000. It turns an almost unplayable game into an absolutely awesome gem.

You gotta wonder how devs cant do this to fix their games, especially when they are as good as this one. Kinda gets you a little peeved :)

The story is a bit hard to get, you have a lot of phones that require you to find them and laptops in which you get more info about what is happening in this world, i actually find it pretty good for a horror shooter.

76561198080690601,1657407655,False,"I recommend the game but not this version. This port is really not well optimised for some reason. Which is odd since this game originally came out on PC. I was experiencing frame drops that just should not happen and required restarting the game to fix. The game just runs terribly from the steam version. I can only play for a bout 40 minutes before the frame rate commits sudoku and I need to quit out and restart. 

The game is a lot of fun. It's a half-life esque shooter with fun bullet time mechanics and interesting spooky twist. It'll give you a kick if you like action and horror games.

Also, elephant in the room, this is the best FEAR game and it is no coincidence you cannot buy JUST this game, if you want Fear 1, you need to buy all three. You can buy the other two individually but not this one. I got this on sale and have no intention of playing Fear 3 (it's not good), so I don't feel like I wasted my money, but it's real stinky a decent game is paywalled behind needing to buy it's inferior sequels and has a poor job running from this version.

Having completed the game, I can say there wasn't anything annoying or bad about this game! It was a solid shooter that for the most part held up very well since it was released in 2005, aside from its horror aspect which doesn't have the same scary effect it might've once had back then. 

The biggest positive of this game though is the gun play! Using all of the guns offered in this game from handguns, rifles, shotguns and more is a lot of fun, especially when using the leaning feature to take cover or carefully move to a position where you can fire. There is a slow motion feature in this game which makes it far easier, but I encourage players to play the game without it to give yourself a bit more of a challenge! There is no part of the game which requires slow motion for you to win. 

I also praise very highly the AI in this game. For 2005, the AI is exceptional in coordinating against the player and being formidable foes in combat be it using various forms of cover, coming in and out of cover rapidly, one enemy using suppressive fire while others try to flank, and pretty damn accurate grenade tosses! 

This game unfortunately is tied in a bundle, but whenever the bundle is at a very discounted price, that price alone is worth this game."

Some of the game's horror aspects certainly date it, but it is certainly worth picking up for most FPS fans (if it wasn't for the insulting price).

PROS:
- Great enemy AI that is still talked about all these years later (though I think it is a bit overrated)
- Fun weapons and bullet time ability that keeps combat continually fresh
- Engaging storyline told mostly through gameplay
- Okay length at around 6 hours to complete
- Solid performance (after configuration)
- Great visuals for the time with impressive dynamic lighting

CONS:
- Insulting price, the publisher has locked this game behind a $55 bundle with the other two (inferior games)
- Lackluster port with a shortage of graphics settings (FPS cap, no in-game FOV slider, etc.)
- The jump scares and horror aspect of this game are by far the weakest parts
- Interiors and environments can get repetitive"

On one hand, it doesn't quite hold up to modern gaming standards that we're all used to, but on the other hand it does have some pretty intriguing singled-out moments. The majority of the game is shooting through similar enemies in same textured walls though, with variation incorporated through the quite smart AI and their use of cover. Story is unique, but it can be guessed where it's going at the halfway point, leaving the ""big reveal"" in the final 20 minutes almost funny in how big of a shock it was meant to be. If it goes on sale for a dollar or something pick it up, but otherwise its an old game that helped pave the way for modern shooters that needs external programs to run properly on modern hardware."

Horribly unoptimized, as good as some reviews may be it was a pain to play when QUICK SAVING results in a below sea-level performance drop, keep in mind this happened even with all the fan patches installed, and it still never worked. I loved the base game FEAR but this terrible.

Because idiot devs don't know when they choose the name (F.E.A.R.) for their game, windows will identify its folder as a (.R) format file and you can't never delete it by any means (tried multiple cmd commands and other solutions of internet but none of them works). Now I just have 2 empty useless folders on my system.

There isn't much to the puzzle. What you can do is wander about and kill your enemies. It's not as terrifying because just jump-scared technique is the only thing they used, and you have nothing to do with it. It means that jump frightening has nothing to do with your character, just the player, and therefore if you turn your head to watch something else or drink water when it happens, you will miss the only technique, in this game, that will make you feel scared.

The ""complete pack"" is a waste though. I recommend buying F.E.A.R. and Extraction Point on GOG.

You can play Perseus Mandate if you REALLY want to, but it's not up to the same standard.

Great game, terrible steam deal with the forced bundling (2 and 3 are generic console ports without leaning, quicksave, and are cookie-cutter sci-fi shooters)."
76561198006893930,1656105823,True,"I remember hearing about F.E.A.R. on the cover of some gaming magazines over a decade ago, and it looked way too scary for my pansy ass. Well ever since then, I grew a pube or two and started being slightly less of a bi*** baby, so I decided that now was the perfect time to try going through this series.

The verdict? Holy s*** I regret not having played this sooner! It's scary, but not the kind of scary that I was anticipating, which is an absolute plus for me since I'm still new to horror games. F.E.A.R. uses the atmosphere and the environment to put you in a constant sense of unease, which I really liked. I was always worried that it would involve Alma getting right in your face and screaming, and I'm so glad it wasn't that at all. I think one of the things that makes F.E.A.R. great is that it's a well refined shooter first, a nosy voicemail eavesdropper simulator second, and a horror game third. 

Now bear in mind, it can be a lil' bit janky here and there on modern PCs. Especially when playing the expansions, but this really just further cements the hard fact that Windows XP is GOATed.

Seems I actually have to stick to older games and not experiment with stupid park simulators like JWE, especially as I bought these just for the dinosaurs and not for the rest of the game.
Which is faulty for sure, since there is no way to enjoy it except in sandbox which has a ""creative"" mode now, but skins are still locked behind the challenge modes.

Î've a full playthrough of F.E.A.R. even though I used some ReShade that made the game a bit too dark, which stopped some jumpscare-moments from working as you didn't see shit. XD
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaaMs9hziB83e0KWsuYnMljUryLHrmv0A
Still it was a nice experience with that setup.

This game included some nasty ninja meele moves, which were together with the bullet time mode some pretty cool stuff for a FPS.
Aside of the nostalgy being strong with this one either, it's still a classic FPS that easily deserves a recommendation.
Part 2 and 3 aren't that good, except part 3 has a coop and CAN be funny if played together.
Yet if you do not have any pal willing to play F.3.A.R. with you, you'll get a hard time to find anyone as it's barely being played nowadays.

76561197972158195,1654480857,True,"        Ok, so. Steam says ive only played 11.9 hours, one full play through (Take into account that most modern shooters can be played through in 5-6 hours thats already twice as much campaign). I got this game on CD's when it first came out, and just like Half Life 2, it takes 5 of them to install. I've played it through 8 or 9 times. I'm sure if you seen or heard anyone talking about this game they've mentioned the repetitive environments. Yes, there is an office building you spend ALOT of time running and shooting in. But it's ok, because the shooting is that damn good. The graphics look dated... until a grenade goes off while you're in slo-mo and you've got the bullet trails, wall debris, smoke plumes, ricochet sparks, blood clouds and exploded telephone books flying all over your screen. For real, the particle effects turn the gunfights into a spectacle. Also, the AI is not ""Step 1 - See player and run straight to cover. Step 2 - Camp cover and wait to get shot by player"". If they know where you are and cant see you, they will find an angle to keep blasting you. FEAR is the best action shooter you will play. Yes the animations for reloading and gun handling while you're moving around are painfully simple and it affects immersion, but when you look down at the floor you can see your body and legs... Gordon Freeman is a floating pair of hands and a gun! FEAR is also the best horror game you will play, in both ways it counts: Jump scares and sheer mind numbing, pulse pounding tension. 

In 2022, this game looks old. But in 2005 it was a rig melter for 2 years before Crysis came out and took that crown. Please play this game, it suffered in HL2's shadow (Which modern shooters still do IMO, thats how good HL2 is) but it was another landmark shooter only a year after HL2 changed everything.

The expansions are dynamite as well. The first one ""Extraction Point"" especially. 

PS, Ive only played FEAR 2 once, not because it sucks, its F***ing brilliant. It's because it      scared... me.... to ....death. Only time ive been scared to tears. I couldnt be left alone in a dark room for weeks after."

76561198121311128,1653608343,True,One of the best first person shooters ever made. One of Monoliths classics along with Condemned criminal origins. The scary aspects haven't aged as well (relies much more on jumpscares than the ambient horror of condemned) but the main gameplay loop is amazing all these years later and the slow mo is unmatched even by Max Payne.
76561198091582046,1653527898,True,This game is a masterpiece its a shame its sequels are such dogshit in comparison
76561199126443804,1653460324,True,"F.E.A.R. is another one of those shooters I've heard good things about for years, and ended up being way late to the party, but it lived up to the things people told me about it.

To start, the AI is actually impressive for a 2005 game. It reminds me of what Valve kinda tried to do with Half-Life 2's Combine AI. They use Squad Tactics, try to flank you, and they don't just rush your position when you have the advantage most of the time. Firefights felt engaging, because I sort of had to unlearn the exploitative habits of other FPS AI like in CoD Campaigns/Spec Ops, Ubisoft's piss poor AI, and even Half-Life 2's Combine, because even they make stupid choices sometimes. The soldiers, or ""Replicas"" as they're called, will hold position and wait for you if there's only one entrance into the area they're in, so you actually have to play somewhat tactically. In the beginning of the game, it might seem like there's not much to the AI, but not too far into the game the level design really starts to complement the AI, and let what I've described really show. Also, the enemy Battle Chatter is really well done, and this game now is my favorite for generic radio filtered voices. The Replicas sound very intimidating, and they'll occasionally swear at you as well, so I hope you don't get your feelings hurt. XD

Next, I want to talk about the weapons. Although the weapon animations are very lackluster, and not really well done, the weapons themselves do pack a punch, and you really feel it. The weapons have some visual kick to them, and despite there not being an Aim Down Sight animation, you still have to compensate for recoil, and there is a Zoom function. The USP feels like a handcannon and not just some crappy generic starting pistol, plus you can dual wield them. The SPAS-12 is God Tier, and you should ALWAYS keep that in your inventory. There's a few more weapons, but I'll let you figure those out yourself.

This ties in with the weapons a bit, but Gunplay and Visuals go hand in hand. Bullets and shells will blow small chunks off of the concrete and the environment, and explosions will send physics props flying, and kick dust up. The shockwave is also visible. The particle effects really help to make firefights feel like firefights. Even if the game is a bit arcady, the visuals help to make gunfights feel visceral and realistic. Dust can float in the air for a few seconds when walls are shot, so you can actually get suppressed behind cover, because you won't have much visibility if you try to lean out and return fire. There's also very good hit feedback for shooting enemies. You'll often see blood splatters, and enemies can get stumbled by your shots, and you can even make them limp instead of running, which is a feature I wish was in more shooters. The game also has a ""Bullet Time"" Slow Motion Mechanic, which is meant to make combat against multiple targets easier, but it's best used just to see explosive shockwave and particle effects in action, so you can really bask in the Visuals. It's impressive how good the game looks for a 2005 game. The Engine used is called ""LithTech,"" it's not just another mid-2000s Unreal Engine 3 game.

Lastly I want to talk about the ""Horror."" The Story has an interesting premise that the horror is meant to complement, but the horror is ultimately negligible. It predominantly relies on cheap jumpscares, hallucination sequences, and literally ghosts. I will give credit to the game's fantastic atmosphere and environments, they do help to sell the horror at least a little bit. The game's story is interesting for sure, plus the game has 2 Expansion Packs and 2 sequels, but don't expect the horror to be anything special. The main reason to play the game is for the visuals and AI anyway.

In conclusion, F.E.A.R. is a fantastic Bullet Time FPS, that has outstanding Visuals, amazing AI, and satisfying Gunplay. Although the horror isn't much to write home about, It's still passable, and I'm sure it was good for 2005. The game's general layout and level design is reminiscent of Half-Life, and just like Half-Life, it's a must play Shooter for anyone who's big fan of Shooters, Arcade, Arena, OR Milsim."

76561199012690065,1652672467,True,"FEAR is a great game. Both in the horror and shooter aspects, FEAR trumps most modern AI and combat systems. 

- Enemies will use realistic combat tactics depending on the situation.
- Enemies will actually try and use teamwork against, an example being one enemy flanking you while another tries to sneak up behind you while distracted. 
- Enemies will use cover and the environment to their advantage. Such as jumping through windows to avoid grenades, and throwing down shelves for makeshift cover.
- Enemies dialogue is dynamic and a tool for the player. The enemies will comment on what they are going to try against you, such as saying ""Flush him out!"" and actually throwing a grenade to get you out of cover. When only one enemy is alone, they will NEVER push alone and they will remain silent to avoid detection, as they have no reason to speak and the AI actually acknowledges they are the only one left.
- Bullet time + One of the most satisfying shotguns in gaming history.
- Unique melee attacks, such as roundhouse kicking, allowing you to not only instantly kill enemies but also do things such as jump through windows. 

And that's just the combat, the story is dark once you learn the background of the main antagonist, and incorporates J-Horror into the mix with the Sadako-like Alma Wade.

Despite the dated graphics, everything else had aged significantly well. Worth a shot today."

It made me tense and there was almost no need for the slow time ability. Maybe if you were low on health and had to move to cover. There are extra missions available seperately.

I've been completely captivated by the story and game-play of this throughout the entire time I've been playing it. Definitely worth a play-through if you have never watched or played it before, I would personally recommend getting it on a sale or wherever you can get it cheapest. :)"
76561198370925539,1651804616,True,"F.E.A.R. is a fantastic shooter with a unique setting and a great blend of horror and action. It has a tightly packed story that wraps up nicely despite being a series, and I have to say this is one of the best shooters in history. It all feels crisp and clean with a whole lot of amazing action inspired by that Matrix scene. The horror is a bit jumpscarey but iconic, and is paced between the action. This a must-play for any fan of shooters, and absolutely worth it. Only issue is getting it on Steam requires you to buy all of the FEAR games so keep that in mind. As well, the game runs poorly on modern systems, so expect issues and having to deal with crashes, especially if you play the expansions."
76561198043784264,1651796676,False,"God help me, ok this game , does not age well. I have seen games that are from the early 90's that age better. No disrespect, I had everything cranked to ultra and for the time this game came out, it was impressive. BUT ITS RINSE REPEAT RINSE REPEAT and not in a cool way.

Nothing in this game is scary. Ninjas are not scary, skeletons are not scary, MECHAS are not scary, Naked Ghost Ladies with Hair for Bewbs are not scary. The only thing even remotely intimdating is the Monsters who are also Suicide Bombers, and they dont show up until the last 10 mins of the game. WHY is the last 10 mins the best part of this game by MILES!? No disrespect for it being a tech demo cause as that its amazing, but OH god This is a bad start to a series I plan to look into...and yes I beat it.

TLDR: BADDDDDDDDDDD NOT AGE WELL GAME, Do not play unless its free, Trust me, Move on"
76561197975051324,1651763355,True,Its still a great game. For its age its a pretty good looking game too. It uses the bullet time mechanics of Max Payne by slowing everything down. It looks cool.

76561198037206870,1651618208,True,Game good.
76561198202376076,1651609471,True,"I waited to finish Extraction Point before I started to write down my review of F.E.A.R.
My first experience with the franchise was F.E.A.R. 2, which I didn't really like. I'd say I had better time with F.E.A.R. 2's demo and not with the full game. Despite that, I was still curious to see how the first one plays out. 
Now that I have finished it alongside Extraction Point, allow me to say this: What a ride! 

F.E.A.R. manages to deliver a very uncomfortable setting and a very good combat system seamlessly. Mind you, saying that the combat is ""very good"" doesn't do it justice. 

Everything that has been said about the A.I. isn't an exaggeration. It's an objective fact that the A.I. is excellent, from the way they drop things down, so they can get into cover, to the way they can ambush you, the Replica soldiers, as they're the ones you fight for the most part, make for engaging combat scenarios, thanks to how they behave. The other enemy types complement the game very well too.

Now let's get into the gunplay itself. F.E.A.R.'s gunplay holds up incredibly well even to this day. And with the slow motion ability, it gets even more satisfying. The shotgun specifically has become one of my favourite weapons in any FPS and it's my favourite shotgun right after Doom 2's and Blood's double barreled shotguns. The nailgun is also a very fantastic weapon to use, with the ability to stick enemies on the wall, as well as the laser rifle from Extraction Point.

The level design is pretty good for the most part, despite the lack of variety in environments when it comes to the base game.

The story is nothing really special, but it gets the job done with its well executed environmental storytelling. And I'm not talking just for the messages on telephones that you find throughout, but also for the way the environment speaks for itself. You get into a room and you sense the terrible things that have happened there. The characters also fit very well with the setting.

The horror sections in the base game are okay. I think Extraction Point's horror sections were better.

The graphics show their age, except for the use of lighting. This has aged very well and adds up to the game's tension. I played the game with no extra patches and on the technical side, it runs pretty well. My only issue is the saving checkpoints. I can say that the checkpoint system is as lengthy as Half-Life's.

Definitely one of the best FPS games out there. I don't know if it's Monolith's best FPS game though, as I have been playing Blood recently and it's not very easy to make a decision between these two games. I highly recommend you to check it out nonetheless."
76561198134519187,1651588540,True,eh
76561197994855428,1651429629,True,"I first read about F.E.A.R when one of the computer gaming magazines I subscribed to had a demo for this game on the disk. Back in 2005, I did not have a computer good enough to run this game at settings that did justice to it. I believe I had a GeForce 5500FX, one of the worst GPUs to have ever been released, and it struggled to run this game at 1280x1024. I decided I wait for my next computer upgrade to play the demo.

After that, the game fell off the radar...until I decided to revisit the game 11 years later.

There were some technical difficulties with running the game in Windows 7, but some simple search yielded the fixes I needed. After I got everything setup, it was time to finally play F.E.A.R.

You play as Point Man, a silent hero who is a part of F.E.A.R (First Encounter Assault Recon) team. When Paxton Fettel, a psychic cannibal, takes control of super soldiers at Armacham Technology Corporation, it is your job to stop him. The story sounds goofy, but thankfully, its the least important part of F.E.A.R.

No one would ever play F.E.A.R for the story. Gameplay is the star of the show here. More than anything, its fun. So often, video games try to do too much, and not focus on the most important thing they are supposed be - a fun and immersive experience. The visuals in this game are excellent. They still hold up to this day. I would argue that they are better than any Call of Duty game to date. I remember seeing screenshots of this game back in the day, and I couldn't believe games could look this good.

Gun fights especially in slow motion look amazing. Its a real treat to get into a gunfight in a dimly lit room, you see sparks flying everywhere, and as the dust settles at the end of the action, the walls are covered with bullet holes and blood. Its unlikely anything I've seen before at the time. I would argue that this game is on par with Max Payne with regards to how well bullet time is implemented.

The gameplay is not anything revolutionary, even for its time. Bullet time mechanics and in game physics have been around for a few years now, but what no other game at its time has done (or since, I would argue) is combat and atmosphere. Its simply excellent. There are times when I had to stop playing after around 10 minutes or so because the combination of music, level design and visuals was a little bit much for me. The game does not rely too much on jump scares, but it excels at making the player uncomfortable.

The PC version, especially when running in on Windows 7 and Windows 10 has some issues but fixes for these are readily available. The game does not support widescreen on default, but with a simple tweak to the configuration file, it is possible to get the game up and running on a 16:9 resolution. I played the game on 2560x1440 resolution without any issues.

F.E.A.R is not without drawbacks, but those don't matter. Considering the game and the expansions can purchased for less than $10 on GOG.com (which I recommend over Steam), there is no reason to not try it. F.E.A.R is simply one of the best PC games ever. It is right up there with Deus Ex, Max Payne, Crysis etc.
Verdict - Must Play.

"
76561198000524957,1651274947,True,"[i]F.E.A.R.[/i] is a solid game. It isn’t outstandingly amazing, just reliably good from start to finish and it still holds up well today.

Mechanically the game is perfectly fine. You have a variety of guns that shoot bullets, an gun which nails enemy ragdolls to the wall (which was probably very exciting in 2005), and a gun that turns enemies into smoking skeletons when you click on them. You have a limited slowmo ability that you can use to fine-tune your aim. You’re fighting against dudes in a variety of different body armors with a variety of different guns, plus the occasional turret or drone. There’s also invisible guys that’ll try to run up and kick you to death. Turning the game’s difficulty up makes it much more interesting, the enemies don’t die so quickly and that gives an opportunity for the game to show off it’s combat AI – enemies will retreat, reposition, flank and generally make themselves a nuisance, which is what you’re looking for in a shooter. The AI isn’t perfect, you’ll occasionally encounter enemies that don’t react to you at all or are doing nonsensical things. This actually ruined the introduction of the invisible enemies for me; my first encounter with them was a blurry spot moving in a corner which turned into a corpse when I shot it. But on the whole it provides a worthy and engaging challenge.

The story is kind of non-existant. You get a bit of introductory narrative at the beginning, a dribble of audio diaries along the way (in the form of voice mails and laptops) and what amounts to a huge (and somewhat predictable) infodump at the very end

The level design is basically one continuous corridor, with occasional bits of branching or looping or backtracking. You’re rewarded for exploration with permanent health and slowmo upgrades. The spaces you’re traversing are completely nonsensical, they have the art decoration of a water treatment plant or office building or scientific laboratory but when you stop and think about the actual layout of the hallways and rooms and the twists and turns you’ve taken as you’ve moved around it because clear that the buildings are illogical places designed by deranged madmen. The insane layouts and highly-repetitive art assets often leads to you getting lost as you’re exploring.

There’s a funicular. All games are improved by the presence of funiculars.

Graphically, [i]F.E.A.R.[/i] is great, which was surprising for a 17 year old game. The character models don’t hold up very well at all, but the buildings you explore are still visually great. It took me a while to figure out why this is the case, but it comes down to the level designers doing a great job of minimizing the technical limitations of the era and some absolutely outstanding lighting. The levels are exclusively human built environments so they’re all straight lines and right angles trivially representable by a low number of triangles, and the textures are all low-noise nearly solid colors which scale up really well. 

Meanwhile, all of the lighting in the game is dynamic, not a baked lightmap to be seen. The first time I encountered a light shining through a grate, casting a large and dramatic shadow on the floor and wall I chuckled to myself that some lighting designer was probably very proud of their work. By the end of the game I was mentally hootin’ and hollerin’ to myself with every new lighting trick I encountered. There’s light fixtures dangling from the ceilings that are physics objects that move with explosions and bullet impacts. There’s tastefully done colored lighting from green soda machines and revolving orange emergency lights and blue electrical arcing. Enemies cut power forcing you to navigate by flashlight and muzzle flashes and then they react to the light from your flashlight before you come around the corner. The pinnacle of the experience comes late in the game when you encounter a gratuitously pointless fully-animated copy machine chugging away in an unlit room, its light moving back and forth casting shadows across everything. Kudos to the lighting team on this game, they did A+ work.

In total [i]F.E.A.R.[/i] isn’t a particularly amazing game, but it is a mechanically sound and altogether satisfying experience that is still worth your time in 2022."

make you laugh. :)

76561198094821039,1650956548,True,"A classic FPS that still somehow holds its own in fun shooting combat. The horror aspect is gripping and the story is awesome. A must play for someone looking at older FPS or FPS horror games. The game will take some fine tuning to get it running with decent FPS and without crashing in the beginning. Again... I found this game **NOT PLAYABLE WITHOUT THIRD PARTY HELP**. Super fun! This review also doesn't take into consideration multiplayer, just the original single player campaign.

This made my experience playable on a modern system:

76561198850914175,1650851009,True,"F.E.A.R is hands down one of the greatest shooters ever made, and is truly timeless. The shooting is extremely satisfying with great bullet effects with bullets causing carnage around you like a john woo film, awesome gore and physics that truly never gets old, the graphics although aged still are not terrible to look at, this game uses bullet time the best in a fps shooter, and makes it very important to use because without you will get shredded, but TRUST me, you won't get bored of it. The story is simple, but with a really cool twist in the end with a great horror atmosphere, and some well placed jump scares, and the expansion pack extraction point is just as good as the main game. I strongly reccommend this to ALL fps fans, but i strongly reccommend getting this by buying the bundle when it gets on sale."
76561198020619925,1650834490,True,"I used to play this game on my dad's PC when it first came out, I remember playing this after half-life 2 and falling in love with the game. The game still holds up to modern standards in my opinion. The AI is intelligent, they communicate, flank, utilize the environment for cover. They even flip over couches, chairs and tables too. They bust through windows, grenade you out of cover. 

The atmosphere of the game is very spooky, there is never a dull moment in the game. Anxiety is induced around nearly every corner. 

The gun play still feels very good, feels better than most modern shooters like call of duty or battlefield. 

The story is very interesting. It takes you down a rabbit hole of telepathic nightmares and corporate corruption.
The further you progress in the story, the more laptops you find, the voicemails on random phones, they all give information as to what is going on and why. The story isn't really handed to you, you kinda have to uncover it on your own which makes this game so unique. 

There are some problems with this game on newer machines, most specifically windows 10/11 PCs. Thankfully there is an easy fix in the form of a .dll file easily found with a simple google search. I won't tell you how to get it, but that information should be more than enough. 

The graphics aren't terrible for an almost 20 year old video game, surprisingly. But, if you want better graphics there is a plethora of graphical modifications for the game and it's expansions. 

If you're looking for a fun singleplayer experience with incredible gunplay, story and physics. This game should be in you back pocket for a rainy day, or maybe just to play and chill out with.

76561198100478817,1650831967,True,"Fear is a classic and it still holds up today. It is still one of the best FPS games ever made. Really fun combat, great music and atmosphere. Some of the best A.I in a game. Be warned that this game does require a fan made patch to get it running.

76561198017019515,1650612407,True,"TL;DR: A must-play for any FPS enthusiasts.

I love this game, and I love this franchise as a whole (F.E.A.R. 3 excepted), been playing since mid-2000s until this day. A masterpiece that still holds up 17 years later, even though it dose has some flaws. This is one of the few games made in 2000s that give me the ""90s""/Ghost in the Shell vibe, which I really missed. Thus I will review this game, more or less with nostalgic lens, you have been notified.

Lets look at the positives first:
+ AI: F.E.A.R. is unique for having one single dev dedicated to the artificial intelligence. The way AI works in F.E.A.R. is simple, they are meant to achieve goals instead of solely on taking out the player. It means AI has fear of death, and they are aggressive. Also AI usually works as a team, rather than bum rushing the player like a wave of zombies with guns (Which most FPS opponents fundamentally are). Replica/ATC forces in F.E.A.R. feels life-like. The combat feels like no other.
+ Map: The maps in F.E.A.R. are designed as mini-deathmatch maps, most of the time at least. Now its not always the case, but when its done right, it works really well. In short, you have more than one approach to the problem, but so does the enemy. This makes the game a lot more exciting than it looks.
+ Slow-mo balance: Not many people talk about this, but this is the only game that doesn't punish the player for fighting without slow-mo. Slow-mo is the ability to slow down time, giving you edge in combat. The AI, because its aggressiveness, has attack delay and reduced accuracy so the player can fight back and avoid taking damage. Doing this in later installments is nearly impossible.
+ Observability: When entering a combat arena, the player usually gets to strike first, or even watch for enemy moments, location, number and even weapon used. The combat feel, mostly fair.
+ Weapons are well designed, aside from automatic weapons, the VK-12 shotgun is legendary, probably the most satisfying FPS shotgun I have ever used. Every weapon has its uses, although later on the game hands out power weapons more frequently, can feel like cheating if you spam weapons like Type-7.
+ Grenades work both ways in F.E.A.R. can be your best friend or worst enemy. It is bad@$$ to see one go off and send a squad flying. AI also throw grenade a lot if you are camping. Other explosives are fine, but due to the fast-paced nature of combat, you probably won't use them much.
+ Ambient sound and soundtracks are awesome, F.E.A.R. 2 did a better job, but still a positive point nontheless.
+ Graphics are excellent for 2005 but it does show its age. Some special effects like light and water effect still hold up.
+ There are hidden health/reflex boosters, and other supplies, awards for exploration. Also the game has quite a few little details and subtle hints, something that modern FPS games really lacked.

Now its the ""meh"" stuff:
* Game is really old, so your PC should run it well. However modern parts CAN screw with your experience. The most common issue is 30 FPS lock, pretty stupid in this day and age. Hot fix is available and easy to get.
* The med-kit system is not that good, you can carry 10 of them but you will likely spam them in the heat of the combat. Again the problem is kind of resolved in F.E.A.R. 2.
* Some enemy types are really annoying, like ceiling turret and UAVs. The power armor is done right though.
* The game mostly lacks horror elements. despite called F.E.A.R., this is probably the most overt horror game I have played, even Doom 3 is scarier. Toward the end, the game does have some proper scary stuff, but other than that, the outside-of-combat horror sections are not that scary. They do however, provide you break between combat.
* Story is okay, there are quite a few details but overall Cliche. Still it can be overlooked since its not what the game is all about. It serves the game well enough.

The negative point I have for this game is mostly about environment:
- Repetitive environment: because the devs are keen to make AI shine, all the things that will confuse AI navigation are removed. You will get same-looking offices, warehouses and factories. Can be boring to some players.
- Ladder is something I really don't like, not the ladder itself, but you have to manually interact with it to climb. Can be tedious since you will be doing this a lot.
- First 3 intervals can get boring after multiple playthoughs.

F.E.A.R. is, among with Doom 3 and Half-Life 2, the best FPS games released in early to mid-2000s. I missed the time when devs are doing something new and pushing the edge. If you haven't play this and you considered yourself as FPS fan, get it and play it on high difficulty, you are welcome.

Final verdict: 9.0/10, old but gold."

76561198045633794,1650234051,False,"I would thumb this game up, but considering the current state of it and how it's sold, and requirements to play the game with anything above 10fps on modern hardware is ridiculous. If you can look past those things, then sure get it, because this game is AMAZING.

Asking such a high price in a package and these issues are not patched. I was lucky to get it on sale for $28.23 but that's still overpriced for just wanting one game that's over a decade old. The developers are shameless."

76561198046798784,1650086514,True,"8/10. The recoil is inconsistent and makes gunplay more of a crap shoot. The movement is slow. The aim down sight mechanics are poor. They should be on a hold instead of a toggle. The maps are maze like. The game allows health kits to be wasted at full health with no benefit. the game would benefit from a health regen system. The lack of regen results in possibly recoverable situations becoming un winnable. No health regen also means pointless collection. The same can be said about limited ammo capacity. The game isn't competitive enough to make these issues more significant.
Edit: I am looking at it again. I will play on a harder difficulty to put it to the test."

[h3]Shooting Ghosts[/h3]
Rode in a car to a filthy alley, investigating a case along with some hunk. I thought I accidentally started Condemned for a second. To think of it, these games have quite a few things in common, like a psychotic streak of artificially induced mass hysteria with grimy overtones of urban decay. Successfully for first-person action games of the time, both invested in their atmosphere, best characterized as high-effort, and cutscenes created solely to increase the player's immersion. In this regard, it's funny yet also clever how they keep knocking you out to change locations without interrupting the continuity by blatant time skips, adding a touch of grace to, let's face it, a b-movie plot, which is presented with a straight face. Always a gamble! Do it ineptly and become a laughing stock, but Monolith managed to show off in the true John Woo fashion, along with flying kicks in slow motion, this game's crux.

Here, we're dealing with an unnerving spiel about a psychic army of slaves to telepathy. The theoretic premise works in practice, melding with the focused gameplay through your old mass murder mystery. Having a fun little story under its belt, the game gets greedy and insists on being spooky as well, but I didn't jump to its scares. Not out of contempt or anything, I still enjoyed some of them. The ones involving stealth assassins were particularly well-crafted, making me anticipate our shotgun dates anxiously, and these freaks didn't disappoint. Alma isn't that creepy, her intermissions are endearing at best, derivative at worst. Regardless, horror sequences are sparse and tastefully psychedelic visually, serving as a welcome change of pace. Shooting ghosts felt hilariously silly though.

[h3]Problems[/h3]
The only scare the game gave me was a crash while auto-detecting performance settings when I started it for the first time. But it launched on subsequent tries without a hitch. Alas, a lesser predicament occurred - my control binds sometimes didn't save between sessions. Turns out, if you have two or more languages in Windows, launching the game with a ""wrong"" layout unassigns your keys. The rebinding process isn't lengthy, but be mindful of your current layout when you're about to play. Either way, compared to typical problems plaguing older games, these are nothing major.

[h3]Presentation[/h3]
The graphics of F.E.A.R are robust. Everything is sturdy, with no dubious collisions or inconsistencies in quality. The textures are meticulous - not that hi-res, but flavourful and authentic. The models are low-poly by today's standards, but do they look solid in their beefiness! The lighting is set up to make the player periodically gasp at the sight of their own shadow. The intent behind the thorough planning of the placement of light sources makes an otherwise bleak level design stand out. I love the feeling of every room being handcrafted with my potential impressions in mind, it's a neat touch. And when things unavoidably get messy, rich particle effects shine in a dance of smoke, sparks, blood, and chips of cement.

The suspense of roaming through the backrooms and vents is amplified by the vibrant electronic music with eerie chanting, the humming of ambience, and your own stomping. Some serious attention was paid to the sounds boots and bullet casings make when hitting various surfaces. It's a strange thing to mention, but these sounds matter since you hear them the most, and their refinement here is off the charts. The shooting is visceral, even the first pistol is weighty and bangs like a cannon. Hitting tin, wood, bodies, or ground are distinctly different noises, always so crispy, and the whistling ricochets were music to my ears. It all culminates in the gratification of stuffing foes with lead, which produces a series of resounding thuds while their pre-mortal cries and convulsions reflect the agony each impact inflicts.

[h3]Guns[/h3]
When it comes to levels, in terms of structure, there isn't much to talk about. Just places to trash, take cover during shootouts, and find stashes of supplies in obvious nooks. The assortment of pickups like medkits, ammo, armor, weapons, and permanent stat boosters provides players with an incentive to be mindful of their surroundings, making them check the darkest corners of the maps. There's no ammo or health item scarcity, but you die fast on Hard, so the trick is in being quick enough to use a medkit at all. However unimpressive the level design aspect sounds, I grew to appreciate the correlation between rundown office spaces and the broken will of deteriorated minds. What's fun to the player who doesn't hurt or get exhausted, isn't necessarily so for their character and other victims trapped in the purgatory.

You can carry up to 3 guns and swap them freely with anything you find. There's a decent choice of modern weaponry with a nice shotgun, assault rifles, pistols, a few types of explosives, and damn fine exotics. The Penetrator is awesome, for who doesn't like nailing a man to the wall since Messiah and Painkiller? But dual pistols were my weapon of choice for their unusual accuracy and power. The latter gets accentuated by the fine-tuned physics, stellar even by today's standards. Shrapnel and bullets have the stopping power to throw bodies around the place without making them cartoonishly fly away at light speeds. The restrained ragdoll looks natural, enemies go from their animations to corpses seamlessly. How foes keep blasting in arbitrary directions while dying, the way they trip and limp after getting shot, all of it adds a fleur of chaotic pazazz to every encounter.

[h3]Roses[/h3]
So does the AI that sprouts its undercurrents throughout, mitigating the repetitive setting and limited combat variety. Enemies look for cover, vault over obstacles, peek and lean around corners, use grenades, shoot on the run, and flank. You can also hear their exchanges on the radio that gives out their intentions, adding context to everything that transpires, and it isn't an illusion, this information often actively impacts the battles. Sadly, the opposition doesn't evolve imaginatively. Instead, the difficulty ramps up as fights grow in scale and more bullet-spongy guys in power armor get introduced, whom I didn't find as fun to fight since they bleed less. I think that invisible ninja assassins that control the lights were a good call in terms of enemy design, and would prefer to fight adversaries sporting weird tactical abilities rather than semi-instagib railguns and health pools the size of a cruiser.

But when Hell breaks loose, everything is forgiven. There's no dismemberment or explicit gore, just chunks of meat, but the game possesses a kind of brutal elegance most of its excessively gratuitous peers lack. Each shootout is an intimate performance to bask in. The bullet-time switches on with the sound of an unzipping fly, then the vicious ballet unfolds. Bullets leave muzzles with the volatile cracking, their Matrix traces pierce the air, grenade explosions visibly warp the space itself, and man-sized blood clouds bloom like rosebuds. As soon as the show ends, the time resumes its stride. In the next instant, casings, staplers, shards of glass, corpses - everything drops like a mike, ringing in the ears, and then a snappy reload punctuates the spectacle with a clack. A couple of seconds pass before the granite dust dissipates, revealing the aftermath of a massacre, and thus, for a fleeting moment, an almost guilty sensation imbues your existence with glee.

76561197997641256,1649622974,True,"Wow, what an experience! F.E.A.R. was so far ahead of its time that it still feels like it hasn't aged. I'm convinced that if it was released recently it still would do well. F.E.A.R. is a game that sneaks up on you. At first you think you are playing an action game with the great AI and slo-mo fight sequences that define the gameplay. But slowly, with every chapter that goes by, horror elements are introduced as the story unfolds. Jumpscares, a creepy dude that peeks around corners, and a crawling alma are just a small sample of said elements, but each never overplay their hand or overstay their welcome. F.E.A.R. is that game that I will recommend to everyone as I feel it is the standard bearer. This game should be what other action horror titles strive to make. A mysterious wonderfully written story with twists and turns, gameplay that doesn't stale, and the small horror elements to keep you on your toes. Perfection! 10/10"
76561199114665588,1649577180,True,classic. so atmospheric. combat is so cool

76561198350168917,1649525389,True,"OK … The game is fine, and I already played it once long a go. 

If you want a game to compare then it's Half Life 1 the original but then with a good horror vibe.

It has platforming and that will say that you can get stuck if you play it for the first time, I think that's OK.
The Battle/Fighting is real cool,  and the AI NPC's aren't dumb if you set the game on hard mode. 

The only thing with this game is that it has no upgrades or real good mods. There are some mods, but I tried 1 of them and the game will glitch on stairs. So play the game vanilla … 
1080P in game is good, but start screen with options is stretch out. 

Then you got to fix the FPS drop with and DirectX file, which you can find a link in the community map on steam for this game. 
You cant find the info for the game fix here -  www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/F.E.A.R.

So is it any good ? YES. If you manage to fix some problems than it's very good and FEAR 2 has similar gameplay but little better and then came FEAR 3 and that last one isn't that great.

So if you like oldskool games like Half Life 1 (original one) then you probably like this game too …

76561197985952929,1648255766,True,great game for its time
76561198101788847,1648248743,True,"What would you get if you put John Woo's movies and J-horror with a dash of Ghost in the Shell in a blender? You get a frantic shooter that is all about killing intelligent military clones and getting spooked by a little girl in a red dress and others every now and then, and that result is not only a game that holds up amazingly well eighteen years since its release, but it's also, in my humble opinion, one of, if not the best first-person shooter I've ever played, PERIOD.

Great graphics and atmosphere for its time (and even now actually!), serviceable yet intriguing story and some of the best FPS combat to grace the platform thanks to a combination of the level design, particle effects, a solid arsenal of weapons (including one of the best shotguns in FPS history), THE FREAKING SLO-MO, and the excellent AI of the Replica soldiers that is still unmatched to this day make FEAR a timeless classic in the FPS genre and definitely a must-play for any shooter fan out there. Its first expansion, Extraction Point, also gets a recommendation from me as well.

That said, for some reason WB decided to make the first FEAR and its expansions only available for purchase on Steam through the complete pack which goes for 55 dollars when not on sale, an odd and anti-consumer decision considering the age of the game. If you want to get the game (which you should!), wait for a sale, look in key sites like Humble and Fanatical or buy a DRM-free copy from GOG."
76561198031567900,1648247413,False,"F.E.A.R. (and especially Extraction Point) is actually my favorite FPS game(s) of all time. No FPS, before or after, has ever 'NAILED IT' like F.E.A.R. did back in 2005. The combat is stellar and the enemy AI is still basically unparalleled to this day.

That being said, Warner Bros has decided to lock this game behind a bundle that'll cost you over 50 bucks to get, with no way of buying the game separately on Steam. And that just sucks...

Luckily the game is on GOG with it's expansion packs for just 10 bucks and physical copies of this game are still pretty cheap if you wanna go down that route. So if you want my advice, just get them from anywhere else but Steam."

76561197979904631,1648210331,False,Such a shame.  I was looking forward to replaying this title.  Remember playing when it first came out in the middle of the night with the lights off.  Goosebumps.  Totally unplayable on modern computers without 3rd party addons/mods. FPS glitch causing stutters with sub-30 FPS and freezing on checkpoint saves (mostly fixable with 3rd party DLL).  No native widescreen support (4:3 aspect only).  Most 3rd party shader/texture packs cause instability with frequent crashes.
76561199108434468,1648173745,True,"One of the best, if not the best, FPS Games I have played.

The features in this game are truly astounding, such as melee mechanics (i.e. slide kicking into people, scissor kicking, etc), not to mention how the area you're in reacts to something you do. Particles go everywhere when you shoot a box or a stack of papers, smoke goes everywhere during a firefight, and sparks as well. The firefights in this game are amazing, and the weapons are great too. 

The combination of horror for F.E.A.R. is also quite nice. I love Alma Wade as an antagonist for this game, considering how both she and Fettel are able to freak you out in many ways. The jumpscares (that is if you don't play the game first) are unpredictable due to the times in which they occur, which I like. 

Even with a gun in your hand, and the ability to kick Replica ass, you're still in ''F.E.A.R.'' of the enemies around you, including the little girl that is after you. All of this makes a truly amazing game.
9.8/10.
"
76561197967459353,1648165822,True,"One of my favorite shooters, It's got a lot going for it. The enemies are smart and capable, especially for the time it was published. I don't know how much is AI and how much is scripted, but they do stuff like flanking you and flushing you out of cover. If they get the drop on you, a single enemy can easily kill you outright. To counterbalance this, there's a slo-mo feature that makes combat a ton of fun. There are also a lot of atmospheric, spoopy scary interludes that have some jump scares that are pretty effective on your first playthrough. It's aged well, too.

The only thing I can say against it is that you can't buy it by itself anymore, you have to buy a package. Even so, the expansions and sequels are mostly pretty good too, so if you can get it on sale, go for it."

Don't sleep on the expansions either, they are surprisingly creative and action packed. But only play them if you are craving more FEAR action.

Make sure to check the PCGamingWiki to resolve any issues with running this on modern hardware. A simple dll file fixed my issues, and you can edit config files easily for widescreen support."

76561199189749702,1646893542,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of my favorite games of all time and the only issue on Steam is that you can't buy it separately from the other two games/DLC.

Other than that, it's definitely playable in 2022 with a few tweaks (you don't need mods but they make widescreen support easier). 

I remember thinking it was scary as a child but I'm an adult now and I beat RE7 so yeah, it's hard to be scared by random lil ghosties. Still spoopy tho. 

Also, I got the whole F.E.A.R. bundle for roughly 10$ on sale so you should do that too because reasons.

Helpful edit after playing around with the settings following some minor graphical issues: find a resolution that is 'supported' by the game (why it lists ones it does not is weird) but also, enable V-Sync in-game/make sure your GPU-settings are set to 'maximum possible refresh rate' instead of 'auto.' Hope this helps someone!"
76561198061999799,1646864005,True,how the fuck does this game get away with making a 7 year old girl pregnant what the fuck
76561198298824224,1646830656,True,"Good shooter, amazing horror and great game overall
But the thing that isn't as good as the rest is AI and even tho it's most likely better than other AI's and even tho i was thinking it's great, at the end of the day it's still bad and dumb and most likely as dumb as a slow mo where you can fire more bullets than in normal time before enemy reacts which also makes game lot easier when you turn it on but makes no sense as both of these should be roughly equal (but 1 second is not equal to 2 seconds in 0.5 time speed or whatever it is) and that is not even worst part about slow mo as in normal time speed enemies run away, cover or do their stuff in slow mo they magicly start to act like a doll and just dance after being hit or sit and cover their heads for no reason)
But beside all the things around slow mo and AI doing AI stuff runing around the place and throwing random bangs or hiding like every other AI with heads still visible and ready to be shot at... it's still a good game with interesting level design and colectibles hidden to upgrade your hp and reflecs (slow mo timer), bunch of different weapons and nades that are always fun to use on groups of enemies or to make traps for the reinforcements with a mine
And the best part of the game and thing you wait for, meetings with Alma and the memories are something that I will remember for a long time (mostly becouse I was scared and wanted it to stop) and I can only hope that the expansions and sequels will be as good in this aspect and even the AI swarm won't be a problem
I recommend it if you wanna feel atmosphere of horror or you like being paranoic after anything moves or makes sound but if you look just for game to shoot at most things that move you may consider Red Faction or Project Snowblind as they will be most likely just as good but will have some cool mechanics and more dynamic gameplay
When it comes to the expansions Extraction Point has few more weapons, scares you more and keeps better climate overall yet still has same not too good shooting experience but if you want to have few more hours of playtime I can recommend it (more than the base game for sure)
And Perseun Mandate is i feel like a step back in a way as the start feels worse than the EP but later it gets more interesting and somehow shootings becomes better even tho nothing changed, there are some scary parts but it focus more on harder combat with special enemies rather than just spooking you again... and it's cool in a way but it didn't let me enjoy they story and gathering all the info as much as if it would not want to become dark souls of shooters but beside that and rather mediocre start I can fully recommend it
There are 3 bonus missions which are speedrun/arena things (I haven't even tried the 3rd one after dying 2 times on the arena) but it's not something I'm interested in, nor it feels like it adds anything to the story really but some may like that kind of bonus challange so it's cool that it's there
Overall I can recommend it but only if you are not looking for a good shooter but a story and scary moments with some techno in the background during combat"
76561198961745348,1646827104,True,"If this game actually added to its sandbox after the first 2 hours, it would be one of the best FPS games of all time, as it stands, its alright."

76561198053284337,1646662660,True,"The Gameplay:
Solid gunplay but your character doesn't really have damage feedback, so you can be out of nowhere almost dead very quickly.

The Story:
The story is both boring and interesting at the same time. Certain delivery of it can be pretty lame, but well it's core is a dark horrifying story.

The Visuals:
For it's time pretty good. it would be pretty rough by today's standards but it has a certain style with the blood spatter + the environment that just gives a creepy vibe.

The Sound:
The music is good for mood setting although I feel the combat music feels out of place. The ambient sound effects are good enough to deliver the story. They aren't top tier, but they get the job done.


The Experience:
This was a game I had been very late to the part to finally play through. So long in fact that looking at it I am like this used to be good graphics. The game is still able to be scary and that is a huge plus. The gunplay is equal parts satisfying and frustrating with it's old systems, this is mainly with hit feedback and just control placement on Keyboard. It's a tad awkward, but I didn't feel like I had to slog through it, but there were moments. This game is not for everyone and this is a very soft recommend, but it did a decent enough job. My biggest complaint which why I will not really recommend this at all is the logitech framerate issue. You cannot play this game without knowing a thing or two about modding or doing some very annoying device manager stuff. That said the game as a whole was fun to play through... but this is like a 5.8/10 experience. Not worth unless you have nostalgia glasses."
76561198136626644,1646619549,True,Older FEAR is very playable with good pacing.
76561198880542295,1646581842,True,Fear amazed me by how god damn god the ai is. I dont why modern games dont have ai as good as this.  Its a great game.
76561198857483909,1646453547,True,"Fantastic game!! Just go ahead and get the entire collection. Got it on sale and not disappointed. I'm currently going thru extraction point and it's just more of what you love from the first game. 

Great gameplay, awesome mechanics, AI is designed so well (I saw one grab a box and drag it to use it as cover, and they actually talk to each other it's too funny). I beat the campaign in around 10 hours so it's a decent length.

Things to keep in mind... if you are stuck in one spot, make sure to look at the floor or for vents. Also I had to disable HID devices to get the game to run smoothly on a modern laptop. Also the story is there but it might be worth it to go find a story summary so you know what's happening. It's very much a gameplay first game."

76561199075617639,1646293635,True,"this game has been out forever but this is my first time playing it. And honestly? even as old as it is it freakin rocks! The gun play is awesome its all so fluid and it packs a punch. during a gun fight all the shooting, bullets hiting walls and objects around creates dust in the air makes it all hard to see. its AI is something that MANY other gaming studios would be jealous of. Alot of those studios try to do the same but fail instead just making the enemy AI bullet sponges. The AI in Fear flanks you and will pursue you the clone soldiers will communicate with each other making the whole cat and mouse game seem more convincing. The story isnt bad...im only like 2 hours in definitely enjoying it. This is one of those games that FOR SURE needs a remaster. Not just updating the visuals a tad ether no...just do a complete overhaul."
76561198001304794,1646124297,True,"Every year i always come back to this game and is always a great experience because there is no game like it and if there is, not to the point it would overthrow because this games combat with horror elements mixed to it with this engine just blends together all so nicely.

The AI in this game is amazing, they can throw grenades to flush you out of cover, push tables down as cover, crawl under shelves to reach you, depending on their weapon would fit it's style so if they had a shotgun they'd rush you, if they had an MP5 they'd be at mid range, Assault Rifle long to mid range etc. They are the reason why the game is so replayable because every encounter plays out differently no matter what and it makes the combat moment feel so much fun to play with no matter your weapon of choice. I have gone through many playthroughs with and without the slow-mo and both playthroughs are highly enjoyable because of how perfect the AI and level design fit each other which is insanely rare nowadays and goes to show how dedicated the company was when it came to making a great game. The combat areas and horror elements don't last too long, both of which are done nicely to the point where you're not getting too little or more of each section but enough time for both sides to be put into the light.

Highly recommended for those into action and horror movie/games as this game is one of its kind and i recommend anyone go playthrough it atleast once. Lastly, i highly recommend you buy F.E.A.R and it's sequels if interested, on Humble Bundle due to how overly priced the Steam versions are and can be only bought in that pack where on Humble Bundle each can be bought separately, once you buy FEAR though which is $15 it'll come with both DLCs so it's worth the time and price.

Completed on: Difficulty Extreme"
76561198049888858,1646007114,True,"The story and lore isn't all that amazing, but the combat and enemy AI is top tier.
The enemy AI in this game is league beyond even modern games: enemies will flank you through multiple paths, flush you out with grenades while hiding behind cover, or rushing you with shotguns while you run from the grenade. Enemies in good positions with long range weapons will never chase you, and hold their position and advantage behind cover.

On the hardest difficulty, you need to be quick, accurate, and use good tactics to survive.
I highly recommend this game if you like challengin FPS games, and especially if you've ever complained about enemy AI being dumb."

I enjoyed the story a surprising amount for a 2005 game (played in 2022), thought the graphics held up quite well, and the story along with the combat were big stand-outs. My only negative for this game is how they released it on PC essentially gating the DLC behind the ""FEAR Complete Pack"" for more money.

The environments are also very samey. You will also need to find a subtitle font fix if you are planning on playing on unsupported resolutions such as 1920x1080.

The story is very mediocre (so much that the DLC for this even became non-canon), and is clearly inspired by japanese horror movies such as Ringu and Kairo, but the gameplay is solid the whole way. And you can often get the entire franchise for dirt cheap through the ""FEAR Complete Pack""."

Despite Monolith's poor handling of the franchise, with the last good entry being F.E.A.R. 2, before Monolith shot this franchise in the head with F.E.A.R. Online, this is an incredibly solid game. The slow motion mechanic isn't just a cheap gimmick, it's a core part of the game that has been taken care of properly! It's not just a feature, it adds to the tactical play of the game! The enemies are smart, even for today's standards. They are incredibly advanced, and all act independently and try the most logical way to survive and take you down! The horror is pretty damn good here, this game gives you just enough that you are still in control, with enough action that you are still scared of the Replicas, and are still frightened to turn every corner!

[b] Plot and Dialogue: [/b]
Not gonna lie the plot doesn't make sense in this game. Do not buy it for this reason. 

[b] Setting and Art Design: [/b]
The setting and art design is where this game excels, besides combat. The way the developers are able to immerse you into this world really starts making you shit your pants and feel like there's a scare around the next corner. The atmospheric horror that is contained in this game is phenomenal and one of the best I have ever played, if not, the best I have ever played. 

[b] Soundtrack: [/b]
Pretty alright soundtrack, helping to amplify the scenes it is in, but it remains silent most of the time, which I feel is a smart decision for the developers as it contributes to the atmospheric horror of the game. 

[b] Graphics: [/b]
Graphics ain't too bad, especially considering this game came out in 2005.

[b] Gameplay and Sound Design: [/b]
The gameplay is the bread and butter of this game. There is a unique dynamic between each of the weapons and the fact that you can only carry 3 at a time, forces you to make decisions on the run to best prepare for the next encounter. The game does emphasis the use of the bullet time mechanic, as you will get melted by the enemies in this game if you do not. The enemies help to make the gameplay great, by there being 4 distinct enemy types, changing up combat whenever you meet them. The enemy acts like a human, and does sound in a squad formation. They communicate, flank if you are behind cover, throw grenades if you are behind cover, they work like a team to take you down, which helps to make the game feel all the most immersive. In addition, the level design is spectacular as even though there are no objective markers, I knew exactly where I was going at all times by the simple fact that if there are bodies behind you, do not go there. You have completed that section already. 

Guns feel super satisfying to shoot and the akimbo pistols are awesome. The sound design helps to mesh this all together to help immerse yourself in the experience, so great job on the developers here on that.

I say that this game is a must play for the atmospheric horror and the amazing gunplay and enemy design for a game that came out in 2005. I never fought such a great enemy AI. Buy this on sale though."

Graphics hold up very well. Obviously it's no where near today's standard, but it didn't feel or look old. I think the reason for this is due to the fact that it's probably one of the earliest games to have implemented visuals that we are accustomed to today. Albeit a very early iteration of it.

76561198073101388,1642689892,True,"9/10

Astonishing bullet-time shooter makes you immerse yourself in a unique horror setting.

Pros:

I like the way the levels challenge the player's reflex. The main character of F.E.A.R. is known as Point Man. The power he possesses grants the player alibility to slow time in shooting. The reflex power can make you invincible in almost all early shooting sequences. But as far as the game progress, you usually be ambushed by numerous enemies, die-hard robot, or kind of invisible enemies which you must use the slow-time power to follow their movement. 

The light and sound effects build a spooky atmosphere to make you completely immerse yourself. You are always suspenseful for the jump scare or enemy ambush awaiting you.

Cons:

But I feel the early game is quite tedious. The first three chapters are a bit slow to set up the pacing. The maximum amount of guns you can carry is only three, which may turn you down sometimes. Some of the weapons are too over-power enough to make you invincible with slow-time power."
76561198071449848,1642689484,False,"The overall experience is meh.

Weapon variety is somewhat limited, especially when the game often gives you very little ammo, and thus you end up using the same 2 guns for 80% of the combat. The overall gun play is fine, but not particularly outstanding. There are some destructible environments/covers which is nice. At the same time, every shot landed on the environment will rise a significant amount of smoke, which can last for about 10 seconds. Obviously the AI can see you just fine, so the smoke forces you to hide in the cover and wait, and thats terrible for the pacing of the combat. 

The story exist, but not really that intriguing. The atmosphere is less terrifying than dead space. 

In the end, you probably wont miss much by not playing the game."

76561198282689930,1642204833,False,"I'm really torn whether to recommend this game or not. To start off, this game passed me by when it first came out. I'm saying this to fully remove myself from any nostalgia or rose tinted goggles that many people have when reviewing older games from their lives myself included. This game has some really solid gunplay with really good impact and variety among the weapons. To compliment this, it has really nice thought out levels (for the most part) with AI capable of navigating it in a meaningful and challenging way. The game also has some insane lighting capabilities and I personally think it can hold its own against something like Doom 3 with the venerable id tech 4 engine. However, these things are only true for the first part of the game. Often times I found myself alone in empty hallways doing nothing. Occasionally there would be health and bullet time boosters lying around to be found, but otherwise it seemed to have no purpose other than showing off the lighting that clearly monolith were proud of. Going alongside this are the really uninteresting horror segments. While for the time I'm sure it created some nice tension and helped the mystery aspect alongside the story, it comes off as really cheap and contrived. This all culminates in a really boring second half of the game. If you're not walking down a dark hallway or being forced into the Alma ""fire hallway"" segments, you maybe come across 3-5 enemies every 10 minutes. By this point in the game you also have weaponry capable of taking them down in 1-2 well placed shots. The last two intervals before the epilogue being the most boring. It filled with more ""fire hallway"" segments which don't get me wrong, I get they're there to drop the big M. Night tier twist on you but from a gameplay standpoint it's just a slog. After this, you have to back track through the entire vault while Alma spams about a million ghosts at you. Overall, this game is nothing more than a product of its time. It's worth playing here and there, but I do not think it's worth a full playthrough. 5/10"

76561198005262036,1642120764,True,"OK, so people are ALL over the board with this game.
#1 Super wide screen works fine with FEAR itself.  Steam and the developers were too lazy to use the same patch for the expansions.  You can fiddle with the .cfg, but it froze within 5 minutes of playing.  I will move onto Fear 2 and scratch playing the expansions.
#2 Modern systems can play the game with everything maxed with no frame rate drops.
#3 No, the game is not even KIND of scary.
#4 Yes, the game is delightfully gory.
#5 Story?  What story?  If there is one it has something to do with some chick from the Ring movie that pops up more than anyone should care and again is not scary and all it does is slow the game down.
#6 Hands down the best AI in a shooter.
#7 Even with #6, play the game on AT LEAST hard.  The slow down ability makes the game too easy.  It constantly recharges.
#8 The graphics still hold up and what's even better is that there are a ton of things in the environment you can shoot; it's actually pretty awesome...even down to dust forming when you break off parts of the wall and floor.
#9 The weapons have a nice beefy feel to them and are all pretty fun to shoot.
#10 The maps are BORING.  I mean it is going down hallways the WHOLE game.  You are in a factory or office building and you better not hope for anything different.  For what they are, the maps are fun at first, but it gets really monotonous.
#11 #10 is really the only downside to this game.  Like I said, the shooting is phenomenal with the guns and the AI and the body parts...

I doubt I will ever replay it, but it was worth a solid day to finish it.  The pack is a rip off on Steam, get the code elsewhere.  I paid like $12 today as I felt after playing the first one it was definitely good enough to pay for it.

I think the best way to play this game is if you're in the mood to just run and gun and cause chaos for like 30 minutes a sitting, this game is great.  However, zero cognizable story, no boss battles, zero environment, it is not a game that is going to hook you to keep playing to see the next moment---other than playing in the hopes the hallways change..."
76561198160007024,1642086477,True,"Action horror done right. 9/10

With a great atmosphere, fun gun play, and a somewhat creepy story, there is a lot to love here if you enjoy films like Ringu and works from John Woo. 
     

PSA: If you are going to play on Windows 10 download the fps fix mod and if you encounter a ""disconnected form server"" issue during a checkpoint while playing the main story then go to performance > advanced graphics settings > graphics > texture resolution > put texture resolution to minimum then continue. you can also restart the game after applying those settings to insure it loads correctly. then after getting past the issue area you can save and turn your settings back to what you had them at.

76561198050002533,1642032081,True,"great game, shooting and AI are top notch."
76561198184745651,1642009012,True,"A underrated game. F.E.A.R is a first person shooter where you take a part in a team called F.E.A.R. You're the Point Man and your mission is to kill a telepathic leader who has awoken replica soldiers. First of all, the graphics are still pretty good. The lighting in this game aged very well with dynamic lighting and shadows being used.

 The story is also pretty interesting and you have an option to listen to voice messages and download information off of laptops, which reveals to you more of what is going on.

 The highlight of this game however, is the gameplay. Every weapon feels good to use in a fight and they are represented in a unique way (especially the shotgun). You can use martial arts type moves to send most enemies flying. Particles in this game are amazing when shooting at enemies and were inspired by John Woo's Hard Boiled. Plus your character has super human reflexes (which basically is a slow mo ability).

The enemy AI is still very good to this day and not many games have this type of AI. It's not super advanced, I mean the game was made in 2005, but its still really good. Enemies use the map to their advantage and have good voice clips for combat. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention this was a horror game too. Yeah,  you are being hunted by a Ghost named Alma Wade, and since this is a horror game you will be jump scared, and for a first play through the jump scares can get you and they are mostly unpredictable, so you will probably be on alert for the first playthrough.

There is also 2 expansion packs that comes with the base game. Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. Both are not canon and have poor written stories, but they give different enemies, weapons and locations. They are still worth a play in my opinion (Even tho Perseus Mandate is the weakest, but it's still worth a try.)

Now, the thing is that F.E.A.R can't be bought on steam anymore unless you buy the complete pack, which is F.E.A.R 2 and F.E.A.R 3 which aren't bad games, yet they aren't the best sequels either. So your better off buying on GOG.com, but if you don't mind the other 2 games, then just buy it on steam. You also need to download a fps patch, which will fix the fps dropping down every minute. Don't worry, downloading it is super easy and isn't a hassle at all, mostly effortless actually.

I really think you should buy this game and try it out. I also recommend playing it on extreme difficulty for the better AI."

76561198074428009,1641992133,True,Good old classic. I can't believe that it's from 2005. Still a great shooter.

76561198284389862,1641795085,True,Easily one of the best first person shooters I've ever played. Every fight feels intense and dynamic. The horror elements spice things up between sections to keep you on your toes. it's an easy buy for anybody that loves FPS games if you aren't a scaredy cat.
76561197989586224,1641779027,True,This game is old but it's a classic just like me
76561197978597226,1641749968,True,"Played Far Cry 2 for 360 and was curious what the praise for this game was and why the sequal was considered inferior as a general sentiment. I understand now.  Gunplay is on another level in terms of feel and enjoyment, the A.I. is more more intelligent and able to utilize the environment in order to oppose the player, and the environments themselves are more well put together in terms of layout and design. The art itself doesn't compare but graphical fidelity is the least improvement you can make when moving into a sequel. Either way, one if the best FPS games I've played."

76561198108351470,1641324392,True,"This is an interesting one. This game is great, it gets a thumbs up. It's dated, but hasn't aged too badly. It's an atmospheric horror FPS from 2005, so take it with a grain of salt and it's great! Now, what has muddied my experience slightly was having to reboot the game every 20 minutes or so because the frame-rate would drop to sub-brick levels and become practically unplayable. Would love to find a fix and truly enjoy the game because it otherwise runs very well."

76561198113377462,1641256988,True,fun
76561198082060532,1641254006,True,"I am absolutely blown away by how amazing this game is. How can a game this old have AI and combat that is superior to 99.9% of games out there today? The gunplay is super satisfying, whether it's dual wielding pistols and landing headshots, sniping enemies from afar, blowing enemies into chunks with a point blank shotgun blast or vaporizing them into charred skeletons with the laser cannon. The sound design is absolutely phenomenal, the soundtrack is great, the guns feel like they have real impact and the ambience is top notch. The AI is easily the best part of the game, they are responsive, intelligent and serve to make every combat encounter feel unique and dynamic. They'll call out their allies dying, call for backup, point out your flashlight if they see it, run from grenades, etc. It's insane how good the AI is in this game and it's such a shame that most AIs in games nowadays don't come close to something like this. This game also has horror elements which are quite effective and give the game a lot of personality imo. The only thing that isn't strong would be maybe the story, but it's not like it was terrible, just ok and generic. 

Bit of a shame the first F.E.A.R can only be obtained via getting the bundle but if it's on sale, definitely get this. One of the best FPS ever made."
76561198898034031,1641243848,True,Fun FPS shooter with a some Horror notes in it.

76561198090165719,1641095684,True,"Fun. The way the game is paced with bullet time shooting, horror, and small environmental platforming all while a pretty good horror story ties it all together stands the test of time.

A personal favorite. Liked it on the 360. Love it on the PC.
"
76561197969975234,1641083916,True,"A masterpiece from 2000s, which was the golden era of single player FPS games. Even its own sequels could not catch up with this game. 

The horror elements are very successful but they are not the only strong part of this game. The FPS mechanics with bullet time is solid and the superb AI of enemies still makes the combat so much fun. 

The graphics (top of the industry back then) are dated now, but the experience is not."

76561198862399973,1640713547,True,"This game is an important piece of gaming history. At the time, it was revolutionary in its AI complexity and successful merge of FPS and horror genres. It's a must-have classic, right up there with the likes of Half Life 1. For me, it's most fun at its highest difficulty settings. You truly feel the hopelessness as you're hiding behind a box, clinging to your last medkit and shotgun shell, listening to enemy conversations with hopes they are as confused about your location as you are about theirs, desperately trying to win this game of hide and seek with what feels like real, online players.
Oh, and Fear 3 is shit. Not the worst kind, but it mainly plays as a generic AAA title (Far Cry 5, Max Payne 3 etc). Definitely not a Fear game."
76561198069334972,1640622778,True,"One of the good old horror classics. Although the game is an ego shooter, I think the atmosphere is quite good at trying to make you feel uncomfortable. I love the soundtrack, even though I never heard any compliments about that aspect of F.E.A.R. The guns mostly sound mediocre at best and terrible at worst. The gunplay, as expected from its age, is also quite bad. I played on the extreme difficulty and I've never struggled with any passages. The weapon variety is probably the best thing about this game. You'll get enough ammo towards the end of the game, that you can keep the strongest weapons and it really feels like, you've advanced a lot since your first mission. I wasn't really scared at any point, since I almost always had full ammunition, health and armor, but if you need to make it harder, just ignore the bullet-time. I can promise a much better experience that way and you'll actually feel vulnerable. The missions are mostly the same, I believe out of 12 missions, 10 of them are: Kill Paxton. But the levels give you a lot of different ways to approach gunfights (for its time). All in all, I was enjoying the whole game throughout. 7/10"

The game has aged extremely well, and the current version supports HD and full 4K resolution for the more modern PC builds, and most compatability issues it previously had have been fixed.

I heavily encourage you to buy the full collection whenever it's on sale as it is an amazing and unforgettable horror-shooter experience which revolutionized it's genre in more ways than one can count.

Despite everything positive about this game, and despite it being one of the most unique and best shooters ever, the world has not been kind to the franchise and it's a damn shame."
76561199005230396,1640424375,True,What a classic!! For a game that is soon gonna reach double decade old age it still holds to the level design and atmospheric sci-fi horror. Just use the FPS drop fix posted in community and you are all set to experience some old-school gem.

Fear has this unique atmosphere and story that will hook you till the end. Too bad the sequels of fear (fear 2 and fear 3) are super bad.

The only problem is the game is short. The game should be at least 80 hours long with easy difficulty and must have at least 50 hours worth of side quests. I give this 9/10."

Thanks for this guy how made this fix(;

To play in F.E.A.R.: Extraction point with hight resolution you need to find settings.cfg in C:\Users\Public\Documents\TimeGate Studios\FEARXP and set your resolution in ""ScreenWidth"" and ""ScreenHeight"".

And in F.E.A.R.: Extraction point & in F.E.A.R.: Perseus mandate i got a bug where on load level i got a message disconnected from server to fix that you need to set all your graphics settings to minimum and load this level again.

Good story, great atmosphere and sound design. Graphics are a little dated nowadays, but the gameplay is still really good. Playthrough takes about 12-15 hours, with the DLC (Extraction Point & Perseus Mandate) adding another 15 hours onto that. 

One the great things about FEAR is the AI of the enemies, probably the best I've seen in a fps, and the gameplay mechanic of slowing down time whilst shooting works really well.

The game does suffer from a lot of frame stutter, so needs abit of tweaking to get it to run smooth on modern day PCs.

A horrifyingly good 8/10"
76561199010062328,1639986370,True,its spooky and terrifying and a little bit challenging to get through but its pretty enjoyable to play and get through you get to go on a mission to hunt someone down while seeing creepy haunted stuff I love it.

That's flatout wrong. This game's soundtrack is atmospheric where it needs to be, and nicely action packed when the time comes.

The combat is amazing, the AI feels real, and immerses you wonderfully. 
Sound design, in general, is A+, guns sound like guns.

And the story is amazing, even if the sequels ruined it a little. It's tense and very scary."

This game is not really scary but it is tense and that tension adds to the already challenging game play a truly enjoyable experience. The story is ok not good or bad just kinda generic. not really sure if at the time of the game release it revolutionized in any aspect but overall the game is fun and exciting. I do have one gripe and that is those turrets, they are so annoying and hard to destroy. NOT FUN AT ALL and why could i not kill that fat asshole who started those turrets up? Other than that the game looks okay and is a great tactical experience and would recommend to anyone that likes slow tense engagements."
76561198100296990,1639921828,True,For the old Game it is still great ! Really good story and Smart Ai that you have to work to beat and even more scary than some new high end top Games .
76561198069529786,1639891745,False,"Such a classic game with a chilling atmosphere and constant ""on edge"" feeling. Never played the DLC and the DLC wasn't made by the original creators of FEAR. Truly do enjoy the game (on the Xbox). The AI is probably still the best when it comes to combating the player. The AI is what truly made the game shine. The gun play is pretty solid. 

The major downside to the game is the fact that you need to go through hoops to get it to work properly. There is a nasty bug that causes massive fps drops and choppy game play due to an HID issue in mouse drivers. Tried some of the fixes and even mapped a controller to no improvement. Wasn't willing to try the .dll fix though. SO that is an option for some to try. Sadly, this is going to be one that is lost to time. The price though, get it on sale."

The story is great, the weapons are great, and the game play is lots of fun! The only drawback is that the environments throughout the main game and the DLCs are so similar that there's not much variation throughout. Aside from that this in an incredibly good FPS/ horror game."

There's still to this day nothing that quite compares to the visceral feeling and satisfaction the gunplay in fear gives you.

I'd recommend buying and playing it just for that alone. The game feels amazing to this day and it puts most modern FPS to shame for just how fun it is.

Of course, it's still also a decent horror game with a semi interesting narrative. Alma remains off-putting and creepy even now after the archetype of creepy long haired ghost girl has been done to death.

If you haven't played this game, you've missed out on one of the greatest gems of its decade."

While I had a blast with it, however couldn't say the same about F.E.A.R. 3. Anyway I always wanted to try the first game and now with a good gaming PC. I'm able to play this classic FPS from the mid 2000s. 

This game is awesome! Great game play, lots of action and horror along with interesting level designs, a killer soundtrack and a well crafted story. All those years of waiting to play F.E.A.R. were worth it! I'll be playing this game a lot!"

Works well with default Proton. Unfortunately bug present on Windows is also there. Few times I got ""Disconnected from server"" error while loading levels with helicopters. I followed advice to put details low, load game and ramp up details back to max. ALT+TAB is friendly pausing game in background."
76561197982855091,1639198732,True,"Recommended. Kinda.

So this is F.E.A.R.! I can only guess that it wasn't called T.E.D.I.U.M. because it'd be harder to think of a snappy covert outfit name to fit the acronym.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still recommending it, in the sort of 'this was a pretty good game for its time' kind of thing, but don't confuse that for a wholehearted recommendation.

Like, this thing came out almost 10 years after Resident Evil and we're still sticking with the same formula, only slightly modified. It's obviously heavily influenced by some Japanese tropes, and not just the Ring-girl appearance of Alma. We've got Ring-girl + psychic powers (and cutscenes that actually do more to make it LESS creepy than more) + the big bad guy is basically your evil duplicate + stock evil corporation #395.

What's a stock evil corporation? OH, I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED, IMAGINARY INTERLOCUTOR!

A stock evil corporation is a corporation - generally involved in something vaguely military-related, but not always (so that you can justify having them working on something super-deadly, of course). It's organized by a video game writer who's never worked for a corporation, and therefore assumes that every person in every department (at least according to the post-disaster logs that you find) is either directly involved in Evil Project #1 or is totally aware of it and their problems extend no further than misgivings, but they're still on-board.

Think about Robocop. Was the guy in charge aware of what all the departments under him were doing? Nope! He just gave out orders and approved concepts and left that shit to his underlings. If he'd been working for a stock evil corporation, he'd have been showing up in a labcoat to see what 'the boys in R&D are up to' and would've been directing the proceedings. Stock evil corps operate the way that the mentally deficient imagine that Musk runs his companies.

A stock evil corporation is incredibly lucky that it's never had its communications security compromised in any way at all.  Maybe they have a 100% kill rate for anyone who's ever hacked an email address there, since 98% of all communications involve Evil Project #1, as well as journalists who find out a little too much, and their corresponding whistleblowers.

And of course, Evil Project #1 has to be cartoonishly evil. Like, the kind of thing that a normal person would dismiss out of hand, but they've got literally dozens, if not hundreds of people pushing this thing to completion. Like an endless power supply that runs on the soul of an orphan, or chicken nuggets for school lunches that turn anyone that eats them into zombies or something.

Not to mention that a stock evil corporation had their buildings designed by M.C. Escher. Imagine what hell it must be to use the bathroom during your workday. Check with your manager for the green keycard, then exit into the hallway that leads to an airshaft that you need to drop 20 feet in, then crawl out into the Carnivorous Plant lab, find a torch locked in a supply closet that you need the green keycard for, fight your way through, one of the plants ate the blue keycard, once you find it, leave the lab, bathrooms are in the next hall, right for ladies, left for gentlemen. It's right next to an elevator that'll take you back to your floor, practically adjacent to your desk. Before you go in the elevator, though, be sure to bury the blue keycard in the bucket of Plant Chow™ for the next person who needs to use the bathroom.

Anyway, throw that all together and you've got a (somehow) fully functioning stock evil corporation.

Which is what we're dealing with here. So, you know, that part's not great. But it does have that old-school style. Maybe you'll find that more charming than I do. For me, the game's a solid 4 out of 10. It's playable, it's relatively bug-free (though I did have to add a file to keep it from lagging horrifically), the areas are monotonous, but it's not a cheap game - it's definitely fair. And the dialogue doesn't suck.

Also, on most enemies, a melee attack is a one-or-two-hit-kill. Just FYI.

If that's the kind of thing that's up your alley, this would be a good choice."

76561198431198110,1639021422,True,"F.E.A.R. could perhaps be the greatest shooter of all time. F.E.A.R. has you taking control of an operative of F.E.A.R. which is short for First Encounter Assault Recon, a special forces designed to combat the unknown paranormal. The game is played from a first person perspective with a 3 weapon limit and has a hard aim system and tactical leaning. What makes this game stand out in the gameplay department has to be the edition of Slow-Mo which is similar to Bullet Time in the Max Payne series in that you have a limited bar and pressing the Slow-Mo key will put you into slow motion, giving you the edge in combat as you can easily counter enemy movements and avoid shots, the meter is limited though so one has to play it smart when using it, it does refill over time however. Another thing about gameplay is you get various grenade types you can switch between, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. As well there are around 9 or so weapons and each one feels unique and serves it's own purpose, all of them are also great to use. Shoutout goes to the Particle Weapon which is essentially the Railgun from Quake, it's really fun to use. You also can do various types of kicks as well.


Adding onto your usual shooting action, the game is also a part horror game as there are many sections where the action stops and you are taken through what may as well be a hallucination nightmare as tension is greatly built throughout and things lurk around the corners, all of it making you question what's going on and leaving you wanting more which the game does resolve by the end of the journey. Personally I feel the horror aspect adds an interesting dynamic to the game and it wouldn't be the same without it. Some parts even startled me


However what F.E.A.R. is perhaps best known for is it's rather advanced ai for the time and heck even today it's still advanced. While traditional enemy AI in shooters follow basic patterns or stand there and eat your bullets, the ai in F.E.A.R. is unique in that they react in many ways to your playstyle, for example if you were to throw a grenade the enemy would see it and run far enough away from your grenade, if you were to try to rush they would signal out to their teammates you are and would form around to take you out, if you were to try to hide they'd use grenades or go around to flank you. They can see your flashlight, so if you leave it on you give yourself away. The ai in F.E.A.R. is really one of a kind as it truly feels like you are fighting an actual enemy that is competent and one has to be skilled to succeed, never at any point does F.E.A.R's difficulty feel artificial in nature, it's always fair and when you fail against the enemy you are at fault. To compliment the ai, the areas in which you fight them typically have multiple paths around, at first you'd ask yourself why there are but once you engage the enemy, you understand that they're there so the enemy has more areas to flush you out from, genius design. Another thing nice is that F.E.A.R actually has enemy types, while there aren't many, the ones that are here all feel different enough and offer a different style of threat that forces you to change strategies. By the way to truly experience the ai at it's peak, play the game on the hardest difficulty, F.E.A.R. has one of the best highest difficulties in any game as it is perfectly designed, never is unfair and is a serious challenge where you must overcome the advanced ai to survive.


Lastly I want to mention the story, graphics and audio design. The story isn't anything hugely special but it keeps you engaged and wanting to know more about what's happening around you, the visuals on the other hand are just amazing for 2005. The lighting, shadows and particle effects are seriously top notch, to the point where you could mistake some bits from being a game from much later. The Audio design is also superb, it features many blood pumping heavy action tracks that keep you on your feet during the big fights and slower ambient or creepy tone tracks that keep you in suspense and on edge in the horror sections, the sound design certainly makes the game even more special.


So overall this game is honestly just a masterpiece, Monolith Studios proved once again that they absolutely know how to make shooters, they already made great shooters with both Blood and No One Lives Forever 1 and 2, but F.E.A.R. blows them out of the water and F.E.A.R. certainly ranks among the best of the best in the FPS genre and remains a classic memorable game for a very good reason. If I were to have to say one bad thing about this game: it's that it ends, seriously it's just so well crafted and so much fun that one can't help but be sad when it's all over.


I usually don't give out ratings in these reviews, but if I had to give F.E.A.R. a rating, I would give it a rare perfect score of 10/10, it's a well deserved score and you should absolutely play this if you never have before."

2. A lot of checkpoint glitches
3. Can't save the game from the options menu (wonder how it's still not fixed after all this time?)
4. Fps drops on the second level (have to download bug fix for that + fans are fixing the game instead of the developers... amazing!)

6. Had a problem from the very beginning when you look around with your mouse and the fps drops to 1, but when i move with wasd without looking around with the mouse the fps is 60 and beyond.
It's almost unplayable for me, idk what rating to give it except 6/10, if they finally fix it one day (and i don't think so) maybe I'll rate it 9/10. This game has a lot of potential and i hope it gets fixed one day or get a remaster.

76561199095615429,1638247261,True,"A legendary shooter that still to this day puts modern titles to shame with some of the most responsive AI you will ever see. This alongside some of the best shooting you will ever experience, with guns being incredibly punchy and unique. FEAR is a solid shooter that focuses on tense, violent, sweaty gunfights that consist of a constant mix of run and gun and cover to cover combat. 

That soundtrack is going to both make you feel uneasy, and powerful. FEAR’s soundtrack is criminally underrated and not something many reviews mention, but is worth your attention and will greatly enhance that feeling of “this is creepy” and “I don’t wanna go in there” that you will feel many, many times throughout this experience. 

It’s absolutely vital that when you are not in combat, you are in walk mode. You are robbing yourself of the experience by not soaking everything in, and taking your time. 

With every fight feeling different thanks to the AI, replicas will communicate with one another and call out what both they are doing, and what YOU are doing. They even get stressed out when seeing you wiping out other members of their squad. Callouts and communication will sound more and more stressed if you are performing well. It’s going to give you goosebumps from the rush you get. It is absolutely brilliant.  

FEAR trades iron sights for a simple zoom feature so you can see all the damage and carnage alongside fancy effects of the chaos you unleash.  This is amplified by your ability to slow down time, with bullet vortex warps leading trails into anything you mag dump, and concussive shockwaves from grenades and other hazards warping your vision, this game delivers in a way nothing else can hold a candle to. 

It’s not just a shooter, you can bicycle kick, and roundhouse kick replica soldiers dozens of feet away through stacks of paper and other props. And if you’re feeling cinematic, you can use your fists. 

Not to mention boasting the single most satisfying pump action shotgun to exist in a game. Ever. There’s no competition. 

FEAR is a game that focuses on being creepy, and not scary, while delivering the perfect atmospheric horror experience packed into a very responsive, challenging, and violent shooter. You’re often going to find that the idea is for you to feel uncomfortable by the dark industrial color pallet mixed with abandoned interiors in the dead of night, rather than rely on jump scares. 

With one simple mod, modern hardware can be taken advantage of by allowing every bullet casing, body, blood stain, and bullet hole to stay permanently in the environment, and it makes for one seriously awesome experience when scavenging ammo. 

Atmospheric horror is a genre long forgotten especially in the shooter market, and this game is a must play for absolutely anyone who enjoys shooters.  I seriously cannot stress enough that you need to play this game. And when you finish, go buy their other title, condemned criminal origins, if you are craving more of the atmosphere. 

There however is one downside, you must install a fan made patch which is perfectly SAFE to get the game running properly. Also make sure if you are using NVIDIA control panel that you limit the game’s frame rate to 60, unless you like every prop in the game dancing around like it’s in a Disney movie. It also messes up your movement. Once you limit it, drag and drop the patch file into the game directory and that’s it. You’re done. The game will work flawlessly. 

I cannot stress enough how worth it this game is. It will show you the love and affection that only games from the edgy 2000’s era can. Back when games were made with love and not paychecks in mind. Buy it. Now."

76561199194353500,1638085421,True,"F.E.A.R is up there with Half-Life and other classics for its sheer level of detail, polish and chaotic fun.

Even as we approach 2014, the visual fidelity of F.E.A.R is still something to behold. Firefights explode in a shower of particles and dust quite unmatched in most other games. You will rend various levels apart with bullets as you play as The Point Man, a member of First Encounter Assault Recon, and each encounter will have a level of cinematic mayhem that time has yet to have dulled. The inclusion of a bullet time mode really makes this shine as the chaos unfolds in slow motion, as well as being a useful tool in the games later, more challenging levels.

The game's AI is fiercely on-point, something which evokes Half Life 1 most strongly of all. Enemy soldiers will communicate with one another and actively work together to seek you out, relaying your position over radio and reacting to your strategies in compelling and exciting ways. This is a game with better AI than most modern shooters.

The horror elements of F.E.A.R are a little on the nose - sudden flashing images of a corpse are not exactly ways that the game 'earns' its jumps - but for each cheap shot it takes in this regard it generally more than makes up with a tense, often surreal, atmosphere and a solid number of ""gotcha!"" moments that aren't cheap at all. Alma has become quite the icon in horror gaming, and she does her part in providing the occasional terrifying moment.

With rock solid shooting, wonderfully dramatic effects - including great ragdoll physics - and servicable story, it's hard not to recommend F.E.A.R. Its quality and attention to detail set a high benchmark for its sequels, and indeed all other action titles."

76561197998846269,1638069292,True,"The pioneer of FPS horror.

This game came out in 2005 and still holds up in 2021. Very satisfying combat against AI that tries to flank you, sneak up on you, reacts dynamically in both their behavior and dialogue. Explosions and gunfire will completely transform the look of a room during heavy combat. The horror aspect is original and unique. Light on jumpscares, but relies more on creeping you out with unsettling paranormal stuff and a backstory you can hear through finding laptops and phone messages throughout the game. The slow-mo ability is fun, but so is playing without it for an extra challenge, as some of the enemies move in and out of cover very quickly while attacking you from multiple angles.

The game isn't perfect by any means and has a few quirks.

On a lot of modern hardware, you have to put a .dll file inside the game directly to improve the framerate (google ""fear DirectInput FPS fix"" and choose the link on pcgamingwiki). Thankfully this is a super easy fix.

The text / HUD elements are tiny on modern resolutions above 1080p (it's even quite small on 1080p). There are a few fixes for this, but I didn't bother with them.

I had a few game crashes in the later levels which only happened when tabbing out.

Soft shadows don't work at first when you also use FSAA, but disabling FSAA and then re-enabling it fixes that.

Some older Logitech mice also cause low FPS, at least on Windows 7 as I remember from when I played it in 2014, that can also be fixed by disabling some things in the device manager. 

Overall this is still a very solid game which has a nice mix of horror moments and full on combat action. But besides that, there are some portions with repetitive level design inside office buildings, though they don't take up the bulk of the game. The overall level design is linear, but it works for the close range combat and somewhat claustrophobic / creepy setting for the horror sequences.

I would have liked to see some of the weapons such as the ASP Rifle appear more often, as during the first half of the game you're mostly stuck with the basic ones (SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Pistols). But in general every weapon has a unique feel to it, and you can really base your playstyle around your choice of weapons.

You will spend a lot of time in samey environments but those environments are tailor-made for the gameplay and neither the horror sections nor the combat sections overstay their welcome.

The game can have some issues running on modern Windows so you may have to troubleshoot to get it working but in my experience its never been too bad."

76561197990082325,1637803721,True,"This game is a masterpiece. And I'm gonna keep this review short and sweet.

Shooting, controling the recoil, seeing the bullets hit the enemies and watching them react to it is soooo satisfying. Your bullets makes sparks on the walls and your shell casings fall on the floor next to you. The flashlight in dark environments really plays a part in this game and it just works. The enemies are really smart. The suppress you, throw grenades to make you move, move as a team on you, shoot you from one side and then move on you from the other side and, if unchecked, they move around so you never know where they are exactly unless you keep an eye on them.

The story is mostly conveyed by listening the recordings on people's answering machines at their offices in the company building where the game is mostly played. And this works perfectly for atmosphere, pacing and keeping it breaf.

And remember, folks, graphics aren't anything if the game is garbage. This masterpiece can be played even on 800x600 and it's still damn good!"

76561197988419332,1637755482,True,"When the trailer for this game originally dropped, I watched it in awe. It light quite the fire under the keister to get myself a PC that could handle it the way it was meant to be experienced. The graphics for the time were intense, and I love well-executed horror, as it is sadly so rare a thing. While I would love to mention a few other things that make me love this game, I would have to jump into the pros and cons instead to avoid spoilers. Experiencing this piece of gaming history for yourself, with all it has to offer is well worth your time!

Pros:
- Advanced AI: Even today's shooters don't often hold a candle to the enemies in F.E.A.R.. Upon discovering you, you will be  suppressed, aggressively flanked, and have reinforcements called in should you managed to get most of them down. You may also be treated to the odd 'nade to flush you from cover!

- Level design: While many games might give you a linear path with some obstacles here and there to take cover behind, with passing attention paid to side rooms for the odd health and armour powerups, F.E.A.R.'s level design makes it so that you can come at sticky situations from a variety of angles, combating squad-based tactics as a single-player and not getting squashed for it.

- Clever use of Horror: You can sometimes find that because of the history of horror in games, movies and television that you can almost have a sixth-sense when it comes to where a jump scare will occur. F.E.A.R. has done a great job of not only including these scary moments where you might not expect them, but making you wary of similar places as you progress. 

- Story: I personally found the story for F.E.A.R. had a good bit going for it. Secret labs, unethical experiments from private companies with government ties.... and the sad human elements came together for a really enjoyable experience. IF you manage to make it through this game (and the others that came after it) you might appreciate it as I have.

Cons:

- Pricing: While an amazing game in my opinion, the price no longer reflects the fact that time is linear... I would only suggest picking this up when it goes on sale (which it does fairly regularly). I'd stick it in your Wishlist and wait for it to ""pop"".

- Not really a con to THIS game in particular, but I find what came after this in the franchise drifted in terms of quality. The first DLC was pretty decent, Perseus Mandate was okay... F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin was missing too much of what made F.E.A.R. an epic in terms of gaming benchmarks. The same could be said of F.3.A.R.. It is a little out of place leaving this in the cons section, but if you play past this game and into the others you'd probably see what I mean. It's hard to remember the great time I had playing F.E.A.R. for the first time, without being brought right down a moment later by thinking ""Yeah, but...."" when you remember that the games that followed were like taking a sandwich with all the best ingredients and then trying to take that same sandwich template and spreading it over two successive pieces. You get two more sandwiches that are missing elements."

[b]By Kiba Snowpaw, the Alpha Ice Wolf from the Mystical World of HowlStrom[/b]

[h2]Game Overview[/h2]
[h3]Title: F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon)[/h3]
[h3]Platform: Steam[/h3]
[h3]Year of Release: 2005[/h3]
[h3]Developer: Monolith Productions, Inc., Timegate[/h3]
[h3]Publisher: Warner Bros. Games, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment[/h3]
[h3]Tags: Horror, FPS, Action, Bullet Time, Classic+[/h3]

[h2]Introduction[/h2]
Greetings, brave souls and fellow furries! I, Kiba Snowpaw, ventured from the icy lands of HowlStrom to dive into the hair-raising world of F.E.A.R., where bullets fly and goosebumps thrive. This is not just a game; it's a heart-pounding, paw-sweating, tail-twitching journey into the unknown!

[h2]A Bone-Chilling Plot[/h2]
In F.E.A.R., you step into the boots of an elite soldier, part of a special forces team investigating the shady Armacham Technology Corporation. It's like stumbling upon a hidden cave in HowlStrom, only to find it's a party hosted by psychic-powered beings and not-so-friendly clone soldiers. And let's not forget about Alma – the girl with psychic powers who makes your fur stand on end!

[h2]Gameplay - Through Furry Eyes[/h2]
The gameplay is as intense as a midnight hunt in HowlStrom. With a variety of weapons and gadgets, you navigate through eerie environments, engaging in bullet-time shootouts that make you feel like you're dodging snowflakes in slow motion. The horror elements? Oh, they're like unexpected growls in the dark, keeping you on your furry toes.

[h2]Graphics and Atmosphere[/h2]
The visuals are as stunning as the auroras of HowlStrom, with abandoned factories and office buildings setting the perfect stage for this spooky tale. The atmospheric music and creepy sound effects are the icing on the cake, or should I say, the howl to the moon!

[h2]The Fear Factor[/h2]
Jump scares? Check. Creepy environments? Double-check. F.E.A.R. delivers a bone-chilling experience, complete with paranormal minions and intense action. It's like playing hide-and-seek in HowlStrom during a blizzard – thrilling, chilling, and utterly unpredictable.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
[i]F.E.A.R.[/i] is a howling good time for those who love a mix of action and horror. As Kiba Snowpaw, I give it two paws up for its ability to keep you engaged, entertained, and on the edge of your seat. If you're looking for a game that combines intense firefights with a spooky storyline, F.E.A.R. is a must-play.

[b][u]Rating: 4.9/5 - An Unforgettable Furry Adventure into the Heart of Fear![/u][/b]
For those with a heart brave enough to face their fears and a spirit ready for action, F.E.A.R. offers an epic journey that will leave your furry heart racing!

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
FEAR is timeless classic, but my first playthought was in year 2021 (but i know FEAR francise), i totally loved this game. I never seen such gunplay and enemy AI that feels like another players. Weapons even thought the are not many of them, are perfect like shotgun with can turn enemies into pile of blood cloud or pistols that feels like primary i used them half game, every weapon serves own purpose. 
Story wise its very good and simple, and horror atmosphere is great all horror is psychological not many lazy jumpscares or screams.
Graphics for 2005 are phenomenal and lighting was even better than Doom 3.
If i summarize it, F.E.A.R. is masterpiece i didnt seen games like this maybe Trepang2 was close. I felt Sequels after playing First Game kinda disappointing.

[h1]Personal Verdict: Masterpiece?[/h1]

76561198025103349,1637477650,True,"If you can cope with the often tedious, sometimes confusing level layout and ""exploration"" parts, you'll be rewarded with some of the most engaging FPS gunplay ever made.

Superior to its sequels."
76561197968017053,1637472314,True,Genuinely scary.
76561199041145477,1637451674,False,"If i was in 2005 and had just played this my opinion would have been different, and I would have enjoyed it more, However this game has aged like fine milk. The good: Graphics hold up, not amazingly, but they are still good(besides character models and faces). As I have seen on previous reviews and comments the AI is still really good, like weirdly good. Besides that everything else is pretty bad. Gunplay is alright at best and boring at worst, with the only cool thing being a couple weapons the laser one, and the force one (dont remember there names), and the slow mechanic was somewhat cool. Enemy types are boring (besides stealth guys) and map design and aesthetics are not very good. I got tired of looking at the inside of office buildings, and residential areas very fast. Horror sucks, I dont need jumpscares in a game for it to be scary, but this game offers none of those and a very boring atmosphere, and i was not scared at any point, ever. Finally story was forgettable and not very good at all. Not the worst game ever, just pretty bad. Again would have seen it better If I played when it released."

See reply comment below which pointed to easy fix for the game. After applying it and HDR ReShade patch game become just like ""remastered"" and I was able to play it without glitches.
I still leave negative response as all this demands additional tampering with the sold title and not everybody is capable doing that."

However, a seperate patch is required to install first before playing, and that is from a third party website. If you bought the DLC, the patch will not cover those either, so you must get a third party patch for those as well. The mod I can recommend for graphics however, is the Mmod. It just does wondrous things to graphics and balancing."

It's very railroady, but the combat and story elements make up for it. Some good jumpscares in this game, but sometimes I would be looking out of a window and end up missing them.

All of the weapons sound and feel amazing (besides the SMG it's rubbish at doing everything). All of the environments and the story feel believable (to a certain extent). Being able to slow down time to perfectly time shots to be able to headshot enemies and blow their limbs off is really satisfying. All of the weapons have a purpose (mostly) and the game really just suits all sorts of play styles. There are many different ways to deal with each fight that occurs and it's enjoyable to try all sorts of methods to deal with the enemies.

76561199215861212,1636395204,True,These are the few of those games that you'll always think about when you grow old. Must play.
76561198388290240,1636371759,True,"For a horror game, aside from a few good moments, it's not very scary. If you're gonna play this, you're playing it for the gameplay and relatively interesting plot. The gunplay feels awesome and the enemy AI is really good. Sure, in some aspects, the game does show its age, like the kinda barren environments and kinda not very good textures in some places but I don't mind it and frankly I think it adds to the experience, but to each their own. The expansions are also great, and even though the community seems to generally dislike the second expansion, I personally enjoyed it quite a bit (aside from the last stretch with the giant brawl to the finish). FEAR 2 and 3 are really bad, I only played trough 3 twice in coop with a friend because its only good point is that you can have a good laugh at how bad it is. Don't waste your money on the complete pack if you're just interested in the first game (since steam doesn't sell the first game separately anymore). I got it for like 2 bucks on a sale from fanatical with both expansions included. Overall, it's great, thoroughly recommended."
76561198309760424,1636250865,True,Amazing retro shooter. It Honestly deserves to be among the ranks of Half Life 2 and Doom 3 in my opinion. It is admittedly the lesser of the three but with its two expansion packs it is a real contender for one of the greatest FPS games of the two thousands.
76561199126212282,1636198031,True,"Most people who want to tell you something about this game focus on its excellent combat, its fluidity and how the bullet-time mechanic makes the combat much more enjoyable, thrilling and even little bit tactical experience. Some people also mention this game's innovative AI, which uses a smart combination of scripts, behavioral trees and AI ""clue"" marks in the maps to make the enemy soldiers act much more naturally, tactically, act as an organized group and cleverly use the obstacles in the map to their advantage. That's why I want to focus on a different aspect of the game, which usually doesn't get as much attention. And that is level design. The overabundance of ventilation shafts, elevator shafts and many other kinds of shafts and ceiling passageways point to a clear inspiration by Half-Life. But Half-Life is completely linear experience, F.E.A.R. is not. Many of the levels have various alternative ways to progress, and especially the earlier levels often consist of many branching parallel pathways or form a closed loop that can be traversed in any direction and allow you to get behind the enemy's back. While Half-Life is making you feel smarter by deciding what path to take for you and forcing you into all these ventilation shafts to make you feel as if you're outsmarting your enemies, F.E.A.R. actually lets you search for these kind of paths and choose for yourself if you want to take them or not. So in this game you are truly outsmarting your enemies. Some of the earlier missions feel almost on par with Deus Ex: Human Revolution when it comes to level design. Sometimes it really feels like the map design of Half-life and Deus Ex: Human Revolution mixed together. Unfortunately this doesn't last and some of the later levels are very linear. I guess the devs ran out of the time to design these maps properly. Still I think it was worth mentioning. Overall F.E.A.R. is a great shooter. One of the best ever made in fact. Especially among the millennial shooter titles it definitely belongs among the greatest games of the top-tier list."

I did encounter a bug wherein an enemy fell below the map and could continue shooting me, but reloading my save fixed it. I faced one hard crash as well."
76561198096575723,1635815015,True,"	F.E.A.R. is a game I quite enjoyed playing. Though it certainly is rough around the edges, at points. But what is sets out to do, it does.

The graphics just aren’t there. The game came out in 2005 and for what ever reason, most media (Movies, Songs, Video games) between the years 2000 and about 2007-2008 I just don’t like. There is something about them that rubs me the wrong way and this game almost made that list. It seems older than it really is, so that might have helped. There is a story thats not half bad if you care to listen to it, but what really makes this game worth it is what it was trying to be. A horror shooter. And it was. Granted, its more shooter, than horror, it still has quite a few scares to be found. Its not always jumpscares or loud noises, sometimes its little things that get you. A face in a window, when you pick up a random heal kit, or just the unsettling atmosphere after you just fought your way through some replicas and it gets real quiet.

	The enemies have some cool AI. Thought its not the best, they try to flank you all the time, throw grenades to get you out of cover. One of the best parts of the Shooting aspect of the game is your ability to slow time. Want to shoot a grenade out of the air? Sure. Its fun to run into a room and start busting caps like John Wick. Or discount John Wick. But the games setting is conducive to the horror element. Mostly fighting at night, in a warehouse or a backstreet, or in a office building its seems to fit what the game was going for. Just enough scares, just enough shooting.

	The story is simple, not that it needs to be anything else. Gameplay is fun, though a little repetitive. I believe that you can only get this game through the FEAR complete pack, which is a pretty penny, if you can pick it up on sale, and this is the genre you like absolutely go for it.

In the late 90's/early 2000's, I was not a fan of FPS games even though they were all the rage then and now. I played the major ones like Half-Life, Halo and Gears of War, acknowledged that they were satisfactory and returned to Tropico, Civilization and the Total War series. More recently, my interests have shifted back towards First-Person Shooters and I'm taking the time to look at some of the older ones more generously and form fresh opinions on them.

F.E.A.R. was just a name to me before I saw Mandalore's review on his Youtube channel and tried it myself. I share his opinion that it's a quality title and remains so to this day. The gunfights are (mostly) satisfactory, the graphics are top-shelf and the audioscape is immersive. This was truly a work of care developed by a quality team who were invested in the project and it seems almost petty of me to offer complaints about any part of it. That said, I do have complaints about several parts of it.

To start with the level design, each chapter (called 'Intervals') is both inspiring and tedious. Inspiring because the way enemies move and attack is intelligent, resourceful and sometimes wonderfully unexpected, but also tedious because many of the forks don't suggest in advance whether it's a dead end or the path forward or a hoard of goodies. F.E.A.R. is a linear title and I like to grab all of the health/reflex boosts on the way, except that doing so requires a lot of circling back when you realize the turn that you took was actually the path forward and not a cache of stuff. A lot of other games are better at suggesting 'Left Turn to supply cabinets and Right Turn towards objective' but this title really doesn't do that well and a lot of time is spent going in circles.

The never-ending scenes where Point Man is forced into vents and sewers and ductwork is clever the first time as well, but becomes 'grating' eventually. I had a friend once who was a fire inspector for buildings - they'd be mortified by these levels and the many dead-ends. The duck-hopping from earlier games also makes a return here, that complicated two-step crouch-jump mechanic that is so hated in games with platforming elements. The character will be doing a lot of that.

Sticking with navigation for a moment, I want to rant about the flashlight. Actually, I want to fill the page with complaints about the flashlight, but Steam only gives me so many words. The in-game flashlight only lasts for 15 continuous seconds and extends 10 feet in front of the character. It doesn't seem too selfish of me to expect a flashlight that can stay on through one complete gunfight and also reach the end of the hallway, but the devs thought that wasn't suspenseful enough so they replaced the military-grade flashlights with these novelty sets. Maybe the other government agencies would respect the FEAR team more if we didn't buy our flashlights at Costco.

The gunfights themselves are the real appeal of F.E.A.R. and they are terribly satisfying throughout the game. The Replica Army seems smart and responds aggressively to the character, and there are great scripted moments where either you surprise them or the other way around. The guards are also extraordinarily helpful with information, shouting things like ""I HOPE THE PLAYER DOESN'T SEE THE THREE OF US IN WEDGE FORMATION ON THE NORTHERN CORNER OF THE SUPPLY ROOM!"" I can (barely) understand why the FEAR team is defending against the advancing Replica Army lead by Paxton Fentel, but it's less clear why the Armatech mall cops would be hostile to the 'Government' Agency. This was theoretically a semi-government operation - did this megacorporation go 'rogue' and decide to fund a massively destructive PsyOp all by themselves? The plot comes off as a little half-baked. It's like the evil Corporation is 'The Force' from the Star Wars movie, an all-purpose plot device that can just be spread over everything to explain discontinuities. ""Well, the answer is evil corporations...that's why this is all happening.""

One small complaint about gunfights is that the twitchy animation of the replica armies make it hard to know which one is the death animation. The final round is just a little more ridiculous and exaggerated than the other motions, but not by that much so the Point Man must keep fire until exactly the right animation. Also, the soldier's last motion has a tendency to leap upwards, so in slow-mo (i.e. Max Payne mode) the enemy often stand in the air for a moment between the Point Man and the next soldier and they can even fall to the ground sitting upright. It's an odd ragdoll effect that I think could have been produced better but is otherwise solid.

Both minor and major gunfights tend to produce thick clouds of building materials and furniture that makes it hard to see or continue fighting. While I approve of the aesthetic effect, I'll bet that the replica army has no trouble seeing through the flying drywall and asbestos while the player-character will have quite a lot of trouble doing so. This may have not been fully considered before implementing and gets awful in the rooms with turrets later in the game - every surface turns into dust but the AI-controlled machine guns know where the player is at all times while I can't see three feet ahead.

I have never seen a game where the plot was more unimportant than this one. Rather than perpetuating the action, the only objective for the entire game is ""Find Paxton Fettel"" and every new plot development tags alongside like a motorcycle sidecar without contributing anything new or changing the goal. There is a story dribbled out slowly through voicemail messages that give you bits of information about a series of projects, but it's like different people reading separate chapters of a book in no particular order. Putting it together would mostly appeal to the diehards that want to completely soak in the canon and lore, but it's really a light presence.

Contrary to the 'Spooky' vibe of the box art and marketing, almost nothing paranormal can ever physically harm the player in this game. This is not ""Dead Space"" where every minor sound or gust of wind means instant murder - neither the strange child nor the psychotic telepath commander seem to draw any destructive power from their paranormal talents. Once the player learns this after a few chapters, everything else is straight-FPS.

There are a few NPC's in the mix, but they are all whiners and unlikable, including the computer programmer, Gabe Newell...I mean, Norton Mapes. There's a bunch of campy 'horror-movie' tropes too that are both weak and predictable. Most characters seem to respond to the escalating horror of the moment by becoming more vulnerable, like in horror movies where the vibe is ""No, the Crazy Butcher is coming - we'd better camouflage ourselves in bacon grease and hide in the smokehouse where we'll be safe"".

I've played games where the greatest asset is the story and atmosphere, but the gameplay sucks (see my review on Stalker: Shadow of Chernobyl) but FEAR is the exact opposite. The gameplay is terrific and immersive, but the story is paper thin and your character seems to be a bystander separate from the unfolding events. But that's alright by me because the designer got all of the important stuff just right - the gameplay, level design, soundscape, graphics, all of it. I'm going to gladly play through the sequels and expansions of F.E.A.R. after this because it really is the best example I've seen of this genre. If I could only have two shooters for life, it would probably be Half-Life and F.E.A.R."

76561198448984535,1634735918,False,"Perhaps [i]F.E.A.R[/i] WAS a decent game back in the day, but now, it's just a testimony to how far games have come.

There is pretty much zero level design here. Levels consist of basically boring repetitive narrow corridors with such piss poor lighting you spend half the time turning your flashlight on and off. I understand the devs were going for the horror aesthetic but making the player blind as a bat by not lighting the environments is just annoying.

The combat itself is fun at first, especially with the way the enemies rag doll when you blast through them with a high-impact weapon, but because weapon variety is scarce, it starts to get old fast. The game doesn't change it up until much later unfortunately and there's only so many times you enjoy slow motion bullet-time before it gets monotonous.

It honestly reminded me of the first Max Payne which was basically just a shooting gallery through cardboard-looking environments in the first place. It still could've been a good game in 2021 if they had put some care into the level design. There is one area (the office) which just drags on and on with so much padding (which occurs in all levels). You spend around 50% (or around 4 hours) of the game in that one area with the same drab office interiors not knowing which way to turn because the corridors just keep looping in on themselves because the right corner was hid without lighting. I spent more time being lost in a maze of never-ending looping corners than actually moving through the place. That level alone makes this game a chore.

I wish I could say this game is a classic but it isn't. Even the narrative is non-existent where you just chase this one dude from the start of the game to the end, so there's basically nothing to say there.

All in all, it's boring, even by 2000's standards. I only played this for completion's sake before moving on to the sequel.

Final verdict: 4/10 by today's standards. Maybe 6-ish by late 90's standards. There's nothing to see here."
76561198059791889,1634730886,True,"F.E.A.R is the game i didn't know i neded in my life.
Just gameplay alone is enought to recommend this game.
I you feel like i need to convince you more how about this:
story
music
atmosphere
F.E.A.R executes all of them fo flawlessly and creates a epic and memorable experiance.

Now, despite all the love i have for F.E.A.R, this i feel need to be said and in my opinion is not said enought. F.E.A.R is a pice of garbage technical wise.
The FPS goes down the drain 60 seconds into playing and can only be fixed by manually patching the game. Same goes for the dlc but patching the FPS for the base game dosen't fix the FPS in the dlc so you have to patch the game twice for the same problem. 
Also, the first dlc (extraction point) dosen't have widescreen support so by defualt you can't play it in hd. This can be fixed by manually setting the resolution in the game files. but this problem in only present in the first dlc, not the second or the base game. Also the game can reverse the resolution fix if you try to access the display options.
Also, if you want to play this game you have to buy the F.E.A.R pack, for 50 bucks. for some reason aren't the first F.E.A.R sold separately anymore, and the dlc dosen't even have a storepage. Thankfully are warnerbros pretty chill with there discounts so try picking it up on a sale for like 10 to 20 bucks.

I love this game and it's not the hardest to going the extra mile to making it work but i feel like we are in a desperat need for a remaster, repackaged F.E.A.R 1.

I strongly recommend this one but just don't expect it to work straight out of the box

76561197968816270,1634617048,True,"Very solid shooter that tries its hardest to scare you and usually fails miserably. The replicas are the best part of this game.

Pros:
- Amazing particle effects make every shootout look and feel fantastic
- Enemies that are incredibly fun to fight (apart from one or two exceptions)
- Weapons generally feel fun to use and have decent variety
- Environments still look pretty good for such an old game

Cons:
- May require some light modding to get it to run well on modern PCs (A simple .dll that fixes stuttering and a framrate cap as the game doesnt like super high framerates above 120 fps)
- Horror elements are pretty lackluster and way too in-your-face, borders on being comical sometimes. 
- Office building drags on for WAY too long and you start to get tired of the same old environment. Thankfully the last third of the game more than makes up for it with some fantastic encounters.
- A lot of the cool weapons come in at the very end of the game and you don't get a lot of time using them. The expansion (extraction point, SKIP perseus mandate) sort of helps but it has some issues.

IMPORTANT NOTEs FOR EXTRACTION POINT:

Extraction point is way more difficult to run compared to the base game. It has basically NEVER been patched by the creators and has a lot of bugs and lacks support for modern systems. While it was exceptionally fun and has some of the best shootouts in the entire series I can't recommend it for how difficult it was to get it to run correctly.

Here's a few keynotes of issues I ran into that you will almost certainly encounter as well.

- NO WIDESCREEN SUPPORT IN SETTINGS. 
Yup that's right, you have to edit the settings cfg file manually to use even 1920x1080 screen resolution. Opening the ingame options will reset your resolution back to 1280x720 and you can't go any higher than that.

- KICKS YOU BACK TO MAIN MENU ON HIGH SETTINGS. 
This one's especially annoying, at two particular points in extraction point (very beginning and about half-way through) if you are running the game on high settings it will BOOT YOU TO THE MAIN MENU with an error message stating ""Disconnected from server."" The only way to fix this is to set the game to the lowest settings, play until the next level change, then switch back to high settings. This is especially annoying because of the other issue listed above requiring you to edit a .cfg file to go back to widescreen.

- REQUIRES EXTRA WORK TO FIX FRAMERATE ISSUE WITH .DLL FIX
The framerate fix for the base game is a bit more anemic with the expansion, and for some reason trying to cap the framerate of the application works sometimes and at other times simply doesn't work. The game will sometimes run fine and other times it jumps up to 600 FPS and shit gets really weird.

Overall Extraction Point was really fun even with the above issues but I honestly can't recommend trying it out simply because of how much work you have to go through just to play it."

Hitting focus and getting a direct hit with a shogun, dual pistols, or grenade is just as satisfying the 10000th time as it was the first. So incredibly satisfying.

76561197986697040,1634254682,True,"The game is pretty great for the most part. 

For a game that came out in 2005 the visuals look pretty good. I saw a freight container reflected into a puddle and I could read the text on the container in it's reflection. This sort of thing is amazing for the time that this game game out. 

Second to visual the sound effects are absolutely awesome too. I kicked a tire while walking past it and it make a rubbery ""Thunk"" sound that sounded just like a tire. I kicked a bucket into a sewer trench and it not only made a very accurate sounding splash but a plastic bucket sounding thunk as well. The characters say swear words when they are panicking which made things seem more realistic. 

The story is not bad. For the most part the game is a typical shooter. run down corridors into rooms and lay waste to anyone you see there. 

The mission objectives are a little bland. You are looking for a guy and your mission objective on every level is find and kill the guy because he is a threat. This being the case it make mission briefings seem totally unnecessary. 


In the late game there is a part with a lot of drones that are hard to kill without taking hits and you fight a whole lot of them in a row without being given enough health packs or ammo to get by. I found this area impossible and very frustrating to pass without an ammo and health cheat. I don't normally cheat unless it's a last resort. (the cheat is kfa if anyone was curious. just hit ""t"" to open chat and type it there). That aside the game is quite good there are some jump scares that are not overly scary and some creepy ghost sightings. 

This game is a classic and it has held up well. I recommend it even though I had to cheat past a part.

assassins creed has 2 years yet to even launch, this FEAR game was beyond its time, not just ahead of it."

it's not the jumpscare type of horror, it's the psychological type. once you start learning more about the story, it gets worse.
it will take you around 8 hours to complete.
for a 2005 game, it amazed me how incredible and smooth the gameplay was. the AI works a lot better than most modern FPS games its actually insane.
it might get repetitive at some point but it will throw new enemy and weapons at you (plus the story intel you find) so you don't get bored. 
great game."

76561198214594327,1633733384,True,"VERY IMPORTANT: From what I can tell what happened to me is a very common problem on modern systems, so basically if you encounter graphical issues and massive FPS drops when playing the first bit then you'll need the online patch which you can find [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=200602677]here[/url]. Apart from that you will want to turn on VSync to on in the settings to avoid graphical issues. (Note each DLC counts as a separate game so you'll want to copy the .dll over again and redo your settings each time)

Decent FPS game with a excellent combination of AI and map design to provide engaging enemies to fight, topped off with somewhat over the top decals to make the fights more cinematic/exciting. The horror aspect exists too but in my opinion it is not the reason you'd play this but rather a nice additional flavouring.
I think the DLC is also attached to the main game too now so I'll review them shortly here too:
- Point Extraction: An escalation of the base game, harder than the base game but that's fine as by the point you play it you should have played the main game anyway and gotten at least semi decent at the combat. 
- Perseus Mandate: A parallel story to the previous ones, it's okay and I feel it got better half way through, but it seems like they forgot how good the lighting worked in hiding imperfections in graphics at the time, Semi-Spoiler: [spoiler]that and the new enemy types ironically feel less human than the clones.[/spoiler]"

76561198096433262,1633562913,True,"I want to give a comprehensive review of each game in its full. I will be doing so here, as I got the full group of games in one bundle.

FEAR: Great game with good amounts of atmosphere. The weapons are solid with a few interesting choices thrown in, but over all, the story is great, and it really can be amazing at times, though some story wise things are very confusing, which I won't spoil. 7/10

FEAR 2: Confusing mess of a game, completely new characters except for Fettle and Alma. The story, I understand, but the company should have just kept the story going with Point Man, and thats it. Beckket, though the story explains why, brings nothing to the game, and the cast of characters are killed off quicker than extras from Game of Thrones. 5/10, only play if its on sale.

FEAR 3: What the hell did they do to this game? Cover system was stupid, no button to have Point Man run, not even to the point where it felt fun. The game was a slog fest, and while the game tries at points to make you understand things from Fettles side of the story, it is still poorly represented. The weapons are nice, and there is a bring back to an older character. Above all else, this game felt like it was trying to be just another military shooter, but with small tinges of horror thrown in. I never felt uneasy in this game, and the cheap jumpscares didn't make it better. 3/10, do not play this game at all. It is not worth your money.

Conclusion: FEAR 1 is the best out of the three, and shows the most care put into it. Only play 2 and 3 if they are on sale or in a bundle like it was for me. Oh, and one final thing. The fact we never fully understood what Armacham wants to do with Alma, nor do we get any sort of closure against the CEO, is just a slap in the face of anyone who enjoyed the series."

Atmosphere is important in a game,but it's not enough when most fundamental thing,fear,is completely missing

final vote: 5

The horror aspect is a bit outdated but I did jump a time or two. The cover based fps mixed with rainbows siege lean system is fantastic. The Ai is smart only on the two hardest difficulties but will make for replaying the story a blast each time. They will flank from all sides, use call-outs to pinpoint locations and hold down areas until you or they are killed. But don't worry about grenades they can't toss at all. The variety of enemies is good ranging from basic foot soldiers, one shot snipers, bum rush shot-gunners, giant mechs and a few more. Along with 6-7 weapons for you to use and a few grenade types.

The gameplay is fun, you have a lot of guns that feel good to shot, you can karate kick enemies in the face, you can slow down time as you shoot to watch in slow-mo how the enemies heads explode, and much more.

To me there are three things that shine incredibly bright in this game:
1. The enemy AI: There's not much variety in enemies but each one has it's challenges. The most basic enemy has better AI than most of the team mates you've had in online games, I guarantee it.
2. The atmosphere: The game sets it's atmosphere pretty quick and holds it down very good. It keeps evolving as you learn and progress and there are sections where you won't be blamed for stopping to take air and remember it's a game and there's no real danger, because you'll be scared shitless.
3. The gameplay: It's shooting done as how shooting should be done in a videogame. It's rewarding, has weight and keeps on giving.

My only complain is that Warner now only sells it as a pack with the other 2 which are not as good."

76561197975925149,1632748662,False,"This is neither a great FPS nor a great horror game.

As an FPS, it is generic fights with generic soldiers in boxy locations. It just doesn't feel like you're in a real building, it feels like randomly connected corridors of generically decorated locations. When this game came out, Half-Life 2 was blowing people away, and even Half-Life 1 released six years earlier had better graphics. Even with low polygon counts, HL1 had better designed buildings and more varied and memorable locations. In this game, there's offices, labs, generic industrial buildings... meh.

The hot graphics trend back in 2004 was pixel-perfect stencil shadowing, and most of the graphics effort in this game is put towards that and moody lighting, which also kills the immersion because it's utterly fake - you can walk up to a pitch-black corridor, even needing your torch to see down it, and immediately once you turn the corner, it's fully lit. That's not how light works in real life, you numbskulls, look up radiosity some time!

The horror in this game is nothing but a few set-pieces every few levels, and there's nothing much to be scared of, as the supernatural entities fall easily to your arsenal of guns. Play the Resident Evil series instead for a real scare!"

76561199037344752,1631963186,True,"FEAR 1, i'm new with this game and this review is just my experience

pros
+ Gun play is satisfying (pistol and g2a2 AR is my favorite weapon in this game) and cool, i can shoot granade and the explosive have cool bubble effect
+ Graphic is clean 
+ horror, but not just a cheap jumpscare, if you never play horror before, u should try 
+ bot/AI is more tactically rather than just shoot and run to you, and they response your action like turn on your flashligt, throwing granade etc


cons
- performance may drop in first install (u can fix with direct input) https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/789-directinput-fps-fix/
- environment kinda boring (still acceptable)

my expericence 8.5/10

Extraction point

pros
+ new environtment (open combat,new enemies(replica heavy riot armor,shades, etc) ,new weapon)
+ more scarier than the original (Interval 5 hospital scene is cool.) 

cons 
- have a resolution issue, this game expansion can't run on 1920x1080. but, u can fix this issue
- not much story
my experience 7.5/10

perseus mandate

pros
+ new weapon like VES advanced rifle (i not like use this weaopon)
+ new enemies


cons
- some maps combat may worse like in "" interval 01 undeneath"" u fight heavy armor with granade launcher in tight space + slow walk is easier to die. 
- new enemies not interesting and annoying, nightcrawler elite and commander have same ability with protagonist 
- story is a bit ambigous,new protagonist ""sersan""has same ability with point man without any explanation at the beginning of the game like surgery or something.
-less scary than extraction point

Enemy AI can sometimes be slightly annoying because they seem to be able to spot you around corners occasionally but otherwise it's got some very intense shootouts, with a very eerie atmosphere. I've only played for 5 hours but already there have been a few moments which have made me jump and it's not easy to scare me usually."

76561198274043223,1631636620,True,"The official video game of /x/, but I'd call it a cross between Half Life, Deus Ex, and SCP.

You play as a special agent of F.E.A.R. which is a secret government attack force solely created for the purpose of eliminating ghosts, aliens, and other paranormal entities that threaten national security. You also have 2 teammates that literally do nothing but get injured and sit on the on their asses for the whole game (it's a black guy and a white woman, go figure). 

Basically, your mission objective is to eliminate a half ghost haunted military commander who wants to kill the corporate executives that created him with a telekinetically controlled battalion of super soldiers. He also wants to free his undead ghost mom from artificial limbo or something. Idk it gets kinda ret,,arded towards the end, but it doesn't really matter because the main selling point is the gameplay.

The gameplay is phenomenal, especially for a game that came out in 2005! 16 years later and all modern devs can do is just re-use old concepts and ideas over and over. This game has by far one of the most unique and enjoyable combat styles/systems of any game I have ever played. It is so over the top and ridiculous, but the way they implemented it doesn't ruin the experience at all, and really makes you feel like a badass super soldier slow-mo diving thru windows clearing entire rooms by jump-kicking and shotgunning 10 guys in under 5 seconds. 

The way they handled the level design is also very impressive. It's meant to be an action game and horror game meshed into one, so you'll be doing the whole John Wick Gordan Freeman thing and then the game suddenly transitions into a scene from the ring. It isn't really scary (unless your just a massive pu,,ssy), but it gives it a nice atmosphere and aesthetic that I haven't really seen another game ever do. Seriously, have you ever seen a game mesh 2 completely different genres into one and do so without it looking weird or forced? Maybe resident evil, but that's really the only one that comes to mind.

Overall, I'd say Rambo Ghostbusters is a 9/10 game. The only thing it really needs is some background music for the many extreme gunfights and dramatic scenes the game offers, because as it stands now the soundtrack is very lacking."

76561197989106738,1630503006,True,"The OG FEAR. Most newcomers to today's videogame landscape won't understand how good this game was when it came out or what made it so great. In my nutshell:  Take Half Life 2, delete the physics puzzles, add horror, bullet time, and crazy good enemy AI. 

Gunplay is great. To this day nothing will ever compare to the CQC player vs AI combat of FEAR. There's no endless spawn waves like COD. There's no bullet-sponge creeps like Destiny 2. Enemies flank. They call out your position. They fall back when they're outgunned. They rush when you're pinned down. It's honestly a thrilling experience that really hasn't been captured since. Shredding through corridors of enemies, blasting them in slow motion with shotguns, and nailing them to walls with the Penetrator is as fun as it gets in an FPS.

When it was released it was one of the best looking games around, and other than the simplified geometry it actually still holds up surprisingly well today. Slo-mo looks great with all of the sparks and debris flying, blood spatter and gore still render well, and at 1440p the overall experience was great. Yes, it's 16 years old, but it's still a looker at times. 

Story is interesting enough. I enjoy it. Secret experiments & corporations with a bit of paranormal spook. Fun stuff. In this installment the backstory is conveyed through data uploads and voicemails. As a result much can be missed, but the overall story arch is cleared up as you work your way through the final 3rd of the campaign. The horror is there, but it's not in your face constantly. Even those who aren't a fan of scary games should easily be able to make it through the handful of creepy moments without being too rattled. 

The only negative I really feel like taking the time to call out is the ""samey"" environments. While FEAR takes you through industrial settings, sewers, labs, & courtyards you can only fight through the same offices so many times before it gets to be a bit of a chore. The middle ~2 hours or so of FEAR are the longest with little variety. 

So with all of that being said and an overall runtime of around 7-8 hours on normal difficulty I definitely recommend this for a first playthrough or revisit here in 2021. There are things that FEAR does that today's games have never been able to recreate, and it's absolutely worth it to experience the game in full if you've never given it a shot."

76561198805877819,1630369036,True,"I bought FEAR because I heard about its amazing enemy AI, and while the AI does flank and actually try to kill me, I feel like it is lauded merely because most other FPS have brain dead zombie AI that has no tactical skill or self preservation whatsoever. Sadly, though great, the AI is about all Fear has going for it over other games. The story was decent, but utterly predicable and stupid if you think about it for more that 10 seconds (like how my ""squad"" seems to be offloading all the work onto the new guy. The level design is alright but it is severly cramped and certainly keeps the AI from fully stretching it legs. Weapon impact, feel, and sound are laughable but work well enough that combat is pretty fun.

All in all, the game is very much a one trick pony, but I still recommend it because of how much of a difference actually competent AI make to an FPS. Just don't pay full price for it as it is not worth the $50.

FEAR is one of the most unique FPSs I've ever played - the focus is purely on the gunplay and how you can interact with the various environments. You can slow down time on a whim and savour every whizzing bullet like it's the Matrix - the fairly stale selection of enemies is more than made up for in their absolutely incredible AI. The clone soldiers in FEAR are only matched by the Last of Us in terms of AI from my experience.

Each fire fight can play out entirely differently as enemies are found in clusters and squads, rather than steadily throughout the level, meaning there's always variables that can alter the experience.

I won't give much away in terms of story - it's a dark twisted tale but slightly hampered by the story telling - boring phone messages...can't win them all.

My only major complaint with the game is the somewhat slow and drawn out middle third of the game, and the fairly generic horror elements - for a game called FEAR, I didn't find it particularly scary - exhilarating perhaps?"

A truly terrifying title in its day, F.E.A.R. popularized bullet-time in the FPS and wow'd audiences with its immersive spiral into psychic madness.

With spooky dynamic shadowplay that still impresses in 2021, the game's lack of much visual post-processing makes a modern playthrough a bit harder to sink one's teeth into.  If you can suspend your disbelief, though, all the elements coalesce into one of gaming's greatest action-horror experiences.
The music and sound design remain as some of the greatest ever achieved in the medium -- and plays no small part in delivering the nail-biting dread you'll face while infiltrating the Armacham Corporation.
Destructible environments and woundable enemies keep each encounter fresh, as gore and debris litter the screen with every shot -- and Hong Kong gun-fu style action becomes encouraged with aerial melee attacks.

76561198064194222,1629545766,True,"Phenomenal first-person shooter & horror game. I personally consider it to be up there with the greats like Quake and Half-Life. Though like every game it has it's flaws.

Pros:
-Very fun gunplay and combat.
-Varied weapons from dual pistols, to SMGs, to assault rifles and rocket launchers. Various types of throwables like grenades, mines and turrents.
-Sophisticated AI (at least for 2005) that will actively track your position and try to flank or flush you out with grenades. Not to aggressive or defensive.
-Very good atmosphere with great worldbuilding.
-A nice mix of physiological & jumpscare horror.
-Solid story.

Cons:
-Low diversity in environment. (Lots of offices and maintenance corridor type areas.)
-Physics break past 60 FPS. (Enemies often launch into the air after death or clip into walls/floor. Funny, but breaks immersion.)
-Lighting is broken in some areas, random artifacting in some places.
-Lacks resolution support for modern resolutions.
-Game saves sometimes get corrupted, so save often with multiple slots.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this game despite its flaws. However, I had to buy the complete pack to get OG F.E.A.R. Pretty scummy move on WB's part as F.E.A.R 3 is not worth the money. So get these games on sale, it's not worth the $55 pricetag."

76561198219821031,1629344903,True,"Quite the old game, but still playable and enjoyable. You have to visit forums to patch the game yourself or your fps will drop significantly in 10 minutes of play. Normally, requiring a customer to fix the game themselves is unacceptable, but this is from 2005, i'd say it gets a pass.

An FPS with no aim down sights, you get hip-fire and ""more accurate hip-fire"" Any difficulty is playable since you have unlimited quicksaves. Some guns are unbearable, and some are usable enough. The standard assault rifle most of the enemies use is what i hate the most and i find the dual pistols to be my favorite. If all the full auto guns didnt shoot a burst instead of one bullet when you tap fire the gun, more guns may feel more usable.

You dont get to fight too many actual supernatural type enemies as this is just the beginning of the series, so it's mostly just cloned soldiers. The AI is often said to be good and i would have to agree (except when throwing grenades, they kill themselves more than you)"

76561197992045288,1629326616,True,"F.E.A.R is an excellent game.

Very well crafted maps. Great use of lighting. Rewarded for exploration. Alternative routes to take. I was also surprised at how big some of the maps are but pleasantly surprised as they are for me the best thing about this game.

The other thing that really shines in this game is the A.I. They are soldiers and they act like killing machines. They will try to flank you and are happy to throw grenades rather accurately at you if you stay static for too long.
To see A.I go prone so they can crawl under obstacles, take proper cover and communicate to their fellow A.I, they along with the great maps really make this a wonderful experience.

As for the bad stuff,
I don't like a lot of the weapons, you're stuck with burst fire mode rifles or weapons like the HV Penetrator which just look and sound awful. The guns feel a bit hollow and it made me feel a little bit disconnected. 

The other issue is ammo, the enemy drop ammo when they die, but its only for the weapon they were using. That means if like me, you really like the pistol/dual pistols, well no enemies use them so you won't really find any ammo for them.


There is a bit where the game will crash, I think it is in the subway level, all you need to do is before you get there turn down your graphics settings to the lowest and it should allow you to continue. After that you can readjust your settings.


So yes, it's a FPS where I hate most of the weapons but all that is forgiven thanks to the Mappers and the people who created and programmed the A.I"

76561197970531340,1628600838,True,"The gameplay of F.E.A.R strangely succeeds more than its deserves to in its unlikely fusion of Max Payne meets Half Life gun play and pacing. Its gameplay is more than a mere gimmick as F.E.A.R partly develops its atmosphere heavy universe through its gameplay by marrying up the military tinged, face paced shooting mechanics of Half Life and mixing it with John Woo inspired Max Payne bullet-time mechanics. These elements contribute significantly to the tension offered white knuckled inducing threats that are lurking around the corner. Hence, as a horror game, the slow motion action serves the darkly psychedelic and macabre story. 

Additionally, the dim lighting and minimalistic soundtrack add depth and foreboding to the settings in the style of the most noteworthy instalments from Resident Evil and Silent Hill. While the visuals, lighting and soundtrack are still impressive in its ability to build atmosphere, it's F.E.A.R's sound design that needs to be applauded. Every footstep and bullet feels isolated and emphasised to enhance the sense of isolation and dread, much like Alien: Isolation. 

The story itself, meanwhile, takes stylistic cues from Japanese horror both in terms of its tone and pacing, not to mention liberal use of blood. While the build-up of the story is well developed in its slow reveals, the overall revelations are fairly predictable but enjoyable to see played out. 

Where a predictable plot or a fast learning curve in gameplay often limits the enjoyment of a game, F.E.A.R doesn't feel held back by those issues. Yes, the gameplay does become repetitive and, again, the plot does follow some familiar beats. But the game is never boring because it is almost immersive which allows it to adhere to its premise as a stylistic horror shooter. 

A classic that strangely nary receives a mention today.

76561198121292285,1628434980,True,one of the best games ever
76561197976091020,1628424101,True,"One of the best, arguably up there with the classics like Doom, Quake, Blood, Half-Life (*cough*Halo*cough*-- Yes, I'm putting that up there, deal with it).
Excellent AI, just terrific gunplay with John Woo/Matrix/Max Payne stylized combat, great visuals that stand up to this day, and staple Monolith great music that is utilized greatly and shines in many scenes.

It has a few issues on modern hardware, but PCGamingWiki has fixes for pretty much everything.
And really easy to mod with the SDK, you can combine the Rivarez mod with decals, debris, bodies staying (check Steam Guides), with the font fix, and if you want your custom tweaks with the dynamic flashlight then the setting is the ""LightShadowLOD"" section (put to high) under the Client->Flashlight section. That way you don't need to hassle with separate mod files that might conflict with each other.

Runs great on potatoes (i7-4710HQ, 840M, 12Gb RAM - Only had a couple of slowdowns in slowmotion usually with the shotgun, though I modded it to shoot like 18 vectors/pellets so might be my fault, combined with the Rivarez probably adds to the extra load), and looks better than a lot of modern games, the dynamic lighting and shadowing which was in 2005 pretty new was used to great effect, creating highly atmospheric environments that modern games might not bother with it as the technology is old hat now, but that's a detriment to them. 
Monolith were smart to figure out that games are allowed to use trickery, sleight-of-hand, to achieve results that look great on the cheap, that you don't need to simulate everything realistically, because that's expensive and pointless in a video game environment most of the time, you can still get decals that look 3D, or water ripples that look great when the bodies of water seem to interact with physics objects - It all looks and feels satisfying, even if it's trickery and illusions. That's honestly in a way more interesting and vivid to think about.
The particles, VFX, physics, textures, animations and models are good, all just shine, the shader work was some of the best of 2005 and still looks great. 
And the AI is a rarity (seriously, like I think the only games I've played with great AI are FEAR, Halo, Control, maybe Crysis but I don't remember it having many situations to shine in, Doom Eternal had surprisingly well implemented AI, and some stealth games like Splinter Cell and Alien Isolation, though only the Alien in it). 
Again a shoutout to the great music, Monolith I think have had an inhouse composer, there are similarities in the OSTs of games like AvP2 and Shadow of Mordor with FEAR here and there from what I remember.

The weapon roster is a classic. Dual pistols are cool to wield. Even the SMG is pretty fun simply because of how great the combat system is with all the debris, particles, smoke and dust flying around, though the assault rifle kind of replaces it later. The shotgun is legendary. The nailgun is just excellent, pinning enemies to walls will never not be fun, nailguns should honestly be mandatory in games (Half-Life 2, Amid Evil, Painkiller, Warframe, all understood this rule, I don't care if it's a modern military shooter, fantasy game or walking simulator, if it doesn't have a nailgun then it's missing the point of videogames), and railguns should also be in that list, which FEAR delivers in the plasma particle beam thingy, which is comically satisfying, turning enemies into goofy charred electrified smoking skeletons, because f it, why not. It has a burst fire missile launcher, because f it, why not. And a heavy repeater cannon that shoots mini explosive rounds automatically, again because f it, why not. 
Only things missing are a laser beam weapon, a minigun and a lightning gun, which I recall existing in the expansions, though I think only the first one is worth playing sadly.

If there are negatives to FEAR, one is the very boxy geometry of environments. Might have been a compromise, trade-off to all the other elements that shine, or just something they ended up with by accident, but noticeable in all environments when other games of that time had more complex geometry. 
Two places were a bit confusing throughout the campaign to navigate the path forward was not obvious (first time you run into a ceiling turret, luckily steam overlay google search revealed where the path forward was).
I guess locational variety is somewhat limited, not that drastically varied; condemned urban areas, docks and water treatment facilities, offices and laboratories, I think that's it? 
And enemy variety is also a bit limited, soldiers of different ranks, different weapons, health and armor mainly differentiating them. There are a few others, a heavy slower armored soldier, the cloaked acrobatic melee enemies which are pretty good, the pretty neat mechs you run into a couple of times, floating security drones, and I guess a ghost type enemy? I understand that in the setting it might restrict how much variety you could think of, though I imagine with the advanced robotics you could have gotten a bit more creative, added more than a mech and a flying drone, and with the supernatural element you could have added a few more different enemies.
The flying drones but especially the ghosts are annoying to fight.
Facial animations are a bit stiff for 2005, and some animations ingame but not many.
Balance isn't the greatest, some weapons clearly are superior to others, and it relies a lot of just munching down medkits.
None of these are dealbreakers, even the batsh*t convoluted nonsensical story is there simply to give flavour and a driving force. Sure I'd always appreciate a better story, but it isn't insulting, you clearly get the impression that the devs mainly wanted a framework to get all the different setpieces and situations to get going and were having fun with it.

But FEAR is about slowmotion, doing silly roundhouse sweeping kicks that one-hit-kills soldiers and sends them flying, slide kicks, bicycle kicks, throwing grenades in slowmotion and shooting them in the air above enemy heads, wrecking scenery to send paper, dust, glass shards all flying in massive plumes that slowly float down, sending enemies fleeing and shooting up offices like you're in an 80's action movie. The moment-to-moment combat loop is a classic that feels better than a lot of games releasing even today. 
I think the only other games I've felt that have approached a similar level of a combat loop have been Max Payne, Control recently, Crysis perhaps when it really manages to come together, maybe Doom/Eternal -though it has a very different style and emphasis on different aspects, and I'd argue Halo (lots of combat feedback from particles, blood spurts, decals, enemy staggers, great AI and combat scenarios, varied silly weapons, a good balance of quickgrenades and quickmelee with excellent vehicular combat and large battlefields with many infighting AI factions making a visual spectacle, music elevating the scenes - only slowmo is missing).
Looking forward for Selaco, Trepang2, Severed Steel, and maybe SPRAWL, Turbo Overkill and Dread Templar will also somewhat scratch that FEAR-like itch. One can hope. (& hopefully Halo Infinite is actually good)

Should be owned by all shooter fans and worth replaying in 2021."
76561198097894817,1628401462,True,Really enjoyed playing this game. it was lots of fun and had its creepy times and challenging times
76561198354017187,1628396439,True,The ultimate game for shooting and shatting. Nothing quite like it.
76561198258467884,1628346855,True,"F.E.A.R is a must-play if you're a shooter fan. With bullet time shooting that pulls no punches, featuring memorable weapons. Something as basic as the Shotgun in this game feels powerful and unique, it blows up your enemies into a pile of organs at close range. Then there's the Penetrator, a gun which impales and sticks enemies to the wall. The visuals hold up for a 16 year old game, with dynamic lighting and having virtually every object in the environment interact with the gunfire, explosions.

There's a focus on horror, with the scary little girl trope being the main antagonist. While I wouldn't say the game is going to make you build up a cold sweat, the usage of shadows, tension and toying with the player's anticipation makes for some great moments.

Actually buying this game can be a bit hard, since if you want it directly from Steam you need to buy the F.E.A.R bundle. If you don't want to pay for F.E.A.R 2 and 3 though and just want this game by itself, your best bet is to pick it up from a key retailer like Humble or Fanatical, or alternatively buy it on GOG. The game will also require some tweaks to get working properly on modern systems. 

 
"
76561198107790669,1628291484,True,"F.E.A.R. is fantastic. The guns feel wonderul and combat is where this game really shines. Battle's feel tense and varied, challenge is present at every part. The introduction of bullet time is a genius way to vary the feel of fights. I think if you're a fan of shooters then you need to have this one on your list. Shame that you can't buy just F.E.A.R. unless you use third party sights which certainly no one can condone ;)"
76561198111715876,1628286816,True,"Like everything in our world, the game is not perfect. Its problems include several corridor locations, under-winding in the middle and at the end of the game, suspense and hitting the player, which are absolutely not felt in any way. At the same time, F.E.A.R. still remains a very atmospheric, complex and therefore an interesting shooter, in which it is very pleasant to shoot. Despite the strange design of the weapon, oriented, perhaps, to the further distribution of the game on consoles. It accumulates the best ideas in the genre by that time, they are collected and adjusted competently enough so that the game does not become outdated to this day."
76561198226147008,1628228545,True,"This series is awesome and I'm surprised a remaster or remake hasn't been made already. 
The only issue with the game is the sudden drop in frame rate. At first i thought it was my computer but after looking it up it seems to be the game itself. There is a way you can fix it though and the solution is not hard to look up.
If you don't get it fixed you will need to exit out of the game and start it up again in order for the frame rate to go back up to normal."
76561197973219138,1628226584,True,É um FPS dos anos 90 lançado na década seguinte. E teria sido o melhor FPS dos anos 90 se tivesse sido lançado na década certa.

76561198274194248,1628122607,True,"Awsome game that still stands the test of time. The enemies are somewhat smart, story is pretty good, it`s tense and a lil scary and the gameplay is solid. The DLCs are a little lacklucster, but atleast the gunplay never gets old."
76561197966163536,1628097600,False,"I really want to give this game a better review, but its graphical performance is terrible. No matter which settings I use, I get consistently awful framerates (<15fps). Keep in mind that I'm playing much newer games with better performance, like Crysis 3. I am simply confounded as to why it's so terrible, and I am left with just two options: either the optimization in this game was always terrible, or it just doesn't work well with Windows 10 (my current OS).

Don't buy this game."
76561198008261599,1628086672,True,"The game is fantastic and the brains of the enemies make the game all the more enjoyable, you cannot get an experience like this in any games nowadays, makes me hella sad."

A .dll file is required to keep framerate from dropping after a few minutes of play. Check the forums, it is easily available."
76561198093101022,1627661051,True,"Underrated franchise

Shooting with shotgun in this game is so satisfying!"
76561199086217015,1627554816,True,"The graphics were good for its time, but haven't really aged well. But the enemy AI, the storyline, the use of sound or the absence of it, the slo-mo ability, are well done. The enemy will take cover, run away, call for backup, try to flank you. Even with the slo-mo ability, you're not a super soldier. If you try facing multiple enemies head on, you'll be killed instantly. The use of light and sound is executed well. It's doesn't feel like a psychological horror or isn't downright scary, but there are some unnerving scenes here and there.

Despite the dated graphics, it's still a competent horror FPS. 

8.5/10"
76561198027373667,1627528018,True,"F.E.A.R. is a timeless classic that's a few years away from being called ""retro"".  Nowadays it seems fairly antiquated.  Besides running around shooting dudes there's some light horror setpieces and scripted events that give it an edge. Other than that it's pretty simple, you run and shoot and activate your slow-mo power up.  What makes this game stand the test of time?  Two things, the AI and the slow-mo.  The AI constantly gets lauded for how intelligent and effective it is.  It is fairly good, but its mostly relies on lots of clever scripting that create a near perfect illusion of enemies who will flank and outsmart you every time you reload a save. The slow-mo is more than just an effect or a tactical ability.  It puts you into a power state where everything you do feels like a calculated ballet of murder and every shotgun blast turns enemies into huge mists of chunky salsa.

The horror elements give the game a unique flavor.  Just running around shooting cloned soldiers in office buildings is cool enough, but the little spooky parts throw you off guard especially when your power level is so high.  Murdering 20 dudes without getting hit once builds you up before an unexpected encounter with a creepy little girl will knock you down and put you on edge.  F.E.A.R is a game about keeping the adrenaline flowing which is usually tied to more crazy action oriented shooters like Doom or Serious Sam.  F.E.A.R. flirts with being a tactical shooter but incorporates other elements that all mesh together perfectly.

The guns are absurdly satisfying.  The aforementioned Shotgun is overwhelmingly satisfying. When used normally it's got a solid punch, in slow mo its a wall of shredding metal. The Penetrator is also stupid fun, whipping around after a battle to aim your sights on the last enemy standing just to realize that you've already crucified him against the wall in a silly pose never fails to entertain.  The tone of the game takes itself seriously, but the combat has the carefree attitude of an 80's action movie.  F.E.A.R. and its expansions are still worth buying to this day, but please ignore the sequels."
76561198364787017,1627470086,True,"If you want to have maximum fun, play extreme difficulty without slow-mo. Yes, its the main feature of the game and main character by the story, but it is practically cheating, and it destroys the fast paced adrenaline close combat. If you want more fun, try to play with slow-mo and kung-fu only, with using pistols rarely. If you a god, do the same thing without quick saving lol )))

Anyway, its one of the best FPS out there, dont miss it"

The AI is incredibly intelligent, they work together and communicate to flank you, and use grenades to flush you out of your hiding place. Did I also mention bullet time? The game's a horror-shooter masterpiece and holds up so, so well today."

76561198110618496,1627250927,True,"This is my very first time playing, so I have zero nostalgia.  It holds up extremely well, as the shooting is fun and has a great atmosphere.  I also enjoy the cold, haunting feeling it has similar to Half Life 2.  

+ Great game even if you never played it. 

- Patch needed to have run well on modern machines. It's super easy, but if you don't want to then don't bother purchasing as you may never get over 20fps otherwise.
- If you only want FEAR 1 (acclaimed as the very best), need to purchase key from 3rd party
- Strangely enough save times are extremely long around 30 seconds and game just freezes that long. 
- Minor nitpick, but who ever thought flashlights only lasting 30 seconds in games would be fun?  It recharges quickly, but even in the year 1447 when George Washington invented the flashlight, he said himself on Fox news... ""Under no circumstances shall thee provide swat team cheap Radio Shack batteries that only last 30 seconds but recharge back in 15 hours JESUS."""

Level structure really helps there too. Amazing visuals for it's time (still clean af) and honestly miss such atmospheric games like this where it felt like big budget title with lots of experimentation sprinkled in, not just something completely safe to print money.

Overall pretty good, I played a lot years ago before I got it on steam and still holds up well. This game really needs a remaster!

The enemy AI really save this game, I do think the ""scares"" are good and the story is interesting enough but you are not here for this.
The expansions are a good addition but its just more of the same, a few new guns and enemies as well as more depth in the story (just a little bit)."

It's not really a horror game but there were still some parts I found creepy. The 'ninja' enemies are cool and they freaked me out with how quick they are. It's unfortunate they only appear in a small section of the game.

This game has aged surprisingly well despite the outdated graphics and the hilariously outdated physics engine. I enjoyed playing this game at the highest difficulty.

I think this game deserves a proper, well thought out, well executed remake (think Resident evil 2 Remake), with modern graphics and a new physics engine while maintaining the unique horror theme/ atmosphere, intense gunfights and keeping true to the story elements ..etc 
if this is done correctly it should be a hit...  playing this game's Remake could even be a better experience than DOOM and other FPS games out there...I imagine this game's remake to be kinda like Prey but much better , much deeper and much more scarier."

76561198035696624,1625537072,True,"My personal theory is that this game is a exaggeration of the real life effects of adrenaline. When I was a kid another kid got mad at me and threw a rock at my head. My friend warned me and I saw him throw it and time just slowed down I could see every detail of the rock and could watch it move across the air. It felt like I was standing there a good 1-2 minutes just watching it fly at me and then I simply stepped out of the way and it flew passed me. Of course a bullet flies much faster then a person can hurl a rock you would need to be able to move your body at roughly 200 mph to dodge a bullet so this is a exaggeration of the truth. (Slight unbreakable reference there.)

I just wanted to give my personal theory about the game and personal story that relates to this game. 

The original F.E.A.R is the best in the series I also like the enemy voices in the original they sound cool and it's a shame they changed it in the second and third. I bought the original F.E.A.R years ago it was one of the first games I ever got on steam and I got second and third much later on. Unfortunately you can't buy them separately anymore like other people have said there's places you can go to buy them individually I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give third party addresses here so just google something like 'F.E.A.R steam key' and you'll find it. I would also shop around to find the cheapest key if I were you as prices from third party sellers can range drastically.

Order of F.E.A.R games from best to worst - 

F.E.A.R
F.E.A.R DLC
F.E.A.R 3
F.E.A.R 2 + DLC

F.E.A.R 2 is by no means a bad game... it's just not as good as the others."
76561198035858659,1625504616,True,"I'm a weirdo freak who has almost 100 hours in this game and almost 50 hours in the second.

The lightning, atmosphere, level design, AI, gun play are all great. I also find the story very compelling. Insanely profitable US defense contractor conducting experiments on humans in secrecy to create a clone army of soldiers that follow psychic commands ? If you're at all familiar with stuff like project MK Ultra, then this game's story is right up your alley. This is by far the best game of the trilogy  and if you enjoy the story as much as I did you should play the second game as well. It's not as good but still a solid shooter with horror elements and continuation of an awesome story.

I replay this game once a year and I still complete it the whole way through and even notice new things each play through. Currently beating it on Extreme difficulty and nope, still not bored of it."

76561198071685580,1625424926,True,"FEAR is a piece of PC FPS gaming history that isn't to be missed. Yes, 16 years on it's dated visually, but I have yet to find such an incredible three-way relationship between outstanding enemy AI, compelling level design and gun play that feels quite as good in many much more recent titles. The story is chilling and there are plenty of unsettling moments throughout the narrative, not to mention the pervasive and thick sense of dread the developers have managed to instill throughout the experience. As has been said many times before by many others, the main standout of this game is the enemy AI; they will work together, flank you, hide from you, ambush you, surprise you. I never felt that I wasn't facing a worthy adversary, especially when playing on high difficulties and not abusing the slow-mo function. All in all, a thrilling experience that I always find myself going back to time and time again. If you're an FPS enthusiast, don't miss this classic and timeless piece of true FPS history."
76561198001991343,1625364171,False,"[h1]Gimme the gist of it, Tiwill.[/h1]
You shoot dudes in the head, move forward, rinse and repeat.

[h1]Okay but is it [i]good[/i]?[/h1]
Depends who's asking. If you were to take Half-Life, keep only the shooting segments, give it a slightly darker vibe and add amateur JPEG jumpscares that will either make you laugh or roll your eyes... would that make for a good game? You be the judge. If that sounds like something you might enjoy, then yeah, sure, go for it.

[h1]Hmm, but do [i]you[/i] like it though?[/h1]
Ye it's ok.

[h1]I don't believe you, Tiwill.[/h1]
Okay fine, you got me. I'll give you the full critique.

[quote=Warner Bros. Entertainment]""Be the hero in your own cinematic epic of [b]action, tension[/b] and [b]terror[/b].""[/quote]

Maybe I should have read that before buying this game, because that's a very contradictory statement right off the bat. 

[b]Action[/b] is the antithesis of [b]tension[/b].
Action is loud, fast-paced, empowering.
Tension requires subtlety and a sense of vulnerability.

This game is about as subtle as a stick of TNT exploding in the middle of a library. 
There's nothing tense about a game designed to make you feel like ""the hero of a cinematic epic of action"".

As for terror, a game [i]can[/i] achieve it through action, but the stakes need to feel high, and the player needs to feel constantly at risk of dying to powerful or relentless predators, which are usually terrifying in their visual and audio design. If the player is fighting for dear life and feeling like prey in a dangerous environment, that is terror through action.

This game is not that. All you do is shoot generic armed soldiers in the head using the exact same weaponry as them. You've got more assault rifles, grenades and medkits than you know what to do with, and you can even slow down time. You have no reason to be afraid. If anything, you're the one they should f.e.a.r.

There is no story hook, either. No characters to get attached to, no sense of urgency. If that long-haired loli was meant to be scary, she wasn't. All she does is interrupt the game with cutscenes. Truly, the most fearsome ability of all.

[h1]Okay okay I get it, it's neither a good horror game nor a good story game. But is it a fun shooter? Is it güd schüt? If I just wanna go kerblam pew pew, is it [b][i]fun[/i][/b]?[/h1]
I mean, there are worse games. But the movement and controls leave a lot to be desired.
If it's trying to be a fun shooter, here's a list of things I don't like about it.
- The ADS button is toggle-only.
- There's no crouch-jumping.
- There's no sprint button.
- There's no reason for this game to have a slow-mo mechanic, when there isn't even a way for you to go fast.
- The FOV gets all distorted like a fishbowl when you look up or down. Never seen that before.
- There's a very strange jitter in the camera if you walk forward and backward, where it doesn't feel like it was made to be played on keyboard & mouse, even though it's an FPS.
- I normally love peek mechanics in first-person PC games (Q and E), but they managed to screw that up too. The character leans way too low, it's like he has to crouch just to peek around a corner. It's just awkward.
- The melee attack moves the camera around like crazy, so when you try to punch furniture for fun, you have to account for the camera movement of the animation, otherwise you'll miss the chair you're trying to whack. Just.. why.
- I once got stuck for like 30 seconds trying to jump out of water. Actually, it happened twice. You know when you're trying to get out of water in a FPS and the game just refuses to let you climb out? Yeah. I had to turn around and repeatedly jump backwards until it worked. Quality.

[h1]Wow, that doesn't sound very good Tiwill. Is there anything you even like about this game?[/h1]
Honestly, I think the way the AI screams out what it's gonna do next is very silly, but it gives you the impression that the AI in this game is very intelligent, which blows people's minds and makes them want to leave a positive review. That's pretty cool.

In all seriousness, this game has pretty good lighting. Yeah, I like the lighting. That's it everyone, review's over, ten outta ten would appreciate shadow technology again.

[h1]Wait! Before you go, can you give an example of an action FPS that [i]did[/i] make you feel terror?[/h1]
Sure. I haven't played a ton of horror action games, but here's a few:
- Dying Light, at night (in the game).
- Some maps in the first Killing Floor can be scary when things go wrong and you and your allies get overwhelmed.
- I guess I can mention Prey, as it did a lot of things right on that front, at least in the first half of the game or so.
- Metroid Prime has its moments."

The game still holds up visually with no mods, the AI is remarkably smart and the gunplay is phenomenal with its particle effects and destruction. There are no cheap UI indicators like grenades, waypoints or x-ray vision either.

F.E.A.R feels like a blend of Half Life and Max Payne with an underlying element of tension that remains throughout. You never know what to expect and every combat encounter plays differently thanks to the astonishing AI.

76561198824740198,1624852836,True,"F.E.A.R. is the kind of game that I would be ok with if it was the only game I could play forever. 
It's such an incredibly fun game that never gets old, it's not only your skill but the opponent's that makes it so interesting. The technological accomplishments of this game are timeless, the enemy AI, the lighting, the mess of debris and blood that crescendos in any firefight and of course what game wouldn't be better without bullet-time. I don't believe there is another first person shooter that has achieved such harmony as much as this one has. It creates a beautiful balance of tension and catharsis, the horror is not in the awful jumpscares they throw at you but the feeling that you are being watched at all times, the payoff of this is incredibly well done and evoked a physical reaction out of me. The pacing is brilliant and I never felt bored at any point during the story except maybe the story part, the story sucks. The amazing thing about old games is that you don't have to care about the story. Going back to the combat, it feels incredible, every gun feels crunchy (I don't know how else to describe it) and that's partly due to the sound design which is amazingly well done for the horror and action. The aesthetic also greatly embodies this balance, it's a minimalist art style that gives way to the chaos of firefights and the ambience of tension. People say that the large amount of office spaces becomes repetitive, but with the variety of how you can decorate the room with viscera and debris I disagree. It also lends to the lighting brilliantly.
If this was it I'd end the review here but fortunately there's a whole 2 expansions.

F.E.A.R. Extraction Point is a perfect extension of the base game, it straightforwardly continues from the ending and starts with a completely new setting. You start with an apartment block that lends itself to a great firefight, later on you get to an aged care home which has an incredible set piece and the AI is brought to a heightened level of challenge and makes you use everything in your arsenal. The subway is also a great setting and it has some amazing level design. This time you get someone to talk and help you fight and this is actually pretty good, it makes you actually care about him until they take him away almost immediately and in the most gruesome way possible. The horror in this expansion is actually an improvement on the base game, they have some legitimately unnerving sequences. The weapons they added were pretty cool but not used as much as I'd have liked. The one enemy type they added was pretty underwhelming however, it's basically just a re-skin of the invisible soldiers from the base game. Overall it's an incredible extra 5 hours of F.E.A.R. gameplay and that on it's own is perfect.

F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate is... fine, it's longer than extraction point and it has some new settings but it's clear they didn't care as much about what they were doing. The lighting is god-awful it ruins any kind of aesthetic they were going for and it just looks years behind the original game that came out in 2005. The AI is also dumber here for some reason, it's probably because you're given 2 companions in this one (one of them's voiced by Steve Blum). This ruins the challenge of the combat so it's technically worse but then they add multiple enemy types that are actually original. They add new acrobatic super soldiers that are pretty hard to kill and require you to keep moving. There are also monsters that show up on the floor that trap you when you walk over them and this is genius because now you have to be aware of your surroundings and it adds to that atmosphere of tension. This expansion is underrated in my opinion and that's because it has an arena mode which is everything F.E.A.R. needed.

F.E.A.R. is a classic FPS that everyone needs to play at least once, unfortunately you can't buy it on it's own on steam, you have to buy the other 2 games which suck ass. I'd recommend finding a website that sells it on it's own like humble bundle or gog, it is definitely worth it.

76561198199693727,1624729883,True,"Before we get into the review, an important note - [b]for whatever weird reason, it isn't possible to purchase each [i]F.E.A.R.[/i] game separately on Steam anymore. But, plenty of other websites sell Steam keys for each game separately, and they are on GoG as well. So take your pick.[/b] 
With that out of the way, let's start the review.

In the manner of the great [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1]Two Clicks[/url] - [b]In a word: Wow![/b]

[h3][b][i]Let's make an army of clones that can be controlled telepathically by a single person...that never backfires[/i][/b][/h3]
Here is a short spoiler-free story synopsis:
Something, something, something, [b]little girl in a red dress[/b]. 
Something, something, something, [b]crazed homicidal cannibal[/b]. 
Something, something, something, [b]you have super-human reflexes[/b].

One important note - the expansions aren't considered canon. So while I strongly recommend playing them, you can jump into [i]F.E.A.R. 2[/i] after finishing the base game.

[h3][b][i]Very smort AI[/i][/b][/h3]
As there isn't that much ""bad"" here, I'll just get my gripes with the game out of the way first. 

Booting up the game, I expected horror to be an integral part of the gameplay. Instead, I got an action-packed first-person shooter with a sprinkle of horror from time to time. While the action was great, I was still somewhat sad to see horror mistreated and used as nothing more than a coffee break between the action set pieces. The only genuinely great horror segments are present in the [i]Extraction Point[/i] expansion but are sadly very short. I wish I could elaborate as to why [i]Extraction Point[/i] gets it right, compared to the base game and [i]Perseus Mandate[/i], but I fear I'll ruin these segments even further for you right here, right now. And I don't want that, as you might find them more rewarding and a better experience than I did. 

Besides butchered horror potential, the lack of levels in the base game poses a problem for its ten-hour campaign, which manifests in the form of repeated corridors and sections, so reused assets are a common sight. The worst offender by far is the office level. It just keeps on going for way too long, and it was my least favourite level, alongside the lab from [i]Perseus Mandate[/i], the second expansion. Speaking of [i]Perseus Mandate[/i], it doesn't do anything better than the base game. Heck, it does some things worse. The new enemies it adds are not the least bit enjoyable to fight, especially the super-reflex boys. The level design is very dull and monotonous, with quite a few recycled areas from the first expansion, [i]Extraction Point[/i]. You do get to fight a boss, so that was cool. 

So in the end...not good, not bad...[b]meh[/b] I guess?

On the flip side, the first expansion - [i]Extraction Point[/i] is the pinnacle of [i]F.E.A.R.[/i] in my opinion; Its runtime is perfect. Its level design is perfect. Its horror is perfect. 
[b]In conclusion - it's perfect.[/b]

Before we talk about the good, I need to mention a teeny-tiny personal issue - [b]The number of medkits is too damn high![/b] I never had less than five medkits say for once - the final boss in [i]Perseus Mandate[/i], and that's because I went Rambo on his derriere.

So with that out of the way, let's see why I loved my time with  [i]F.E.A.R.[/i]

Simple, the [i]shooty-shooty[/i] is excellent. Three key components complement each other and make theshooting segments [i]oh so bloody[/i] and [i]oh so satisfying[/i]. 

[b]First is the ""intelligent"" enemy A.I.[/b]. I used quotation marks since enemies can still exhibit signs of brain damage, but very rarely. More often than not, they utilize the environment to their advantage and display excellent teamwork with constant support-fire, headcount and flanking. It made these encounters a decent challenge. There is also decent enemy variety, with light and heavy units, tiny t-rex mechas and other weird contraptions looking to turn you into blood jelly. So not only are enemies [i]very smort[/i] and [i]very diverse[/i], they also have different weaknesses to certain weapons. They are all weak to a shotgun to the face tho...Except for the t-rex mechas, they have no face :l

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2528480852

Next is the games exceptional [b]level design of the shootout segments.[/b] Usually, you'll be fighting in tight and compact spaces, but there are also plenty of levels with a more open playground. They offer plenty of flanking possibilities for both you and your enemies and decent manoeuvrability, and even the chance to have the [i]high ground[/i]. I trust you know what to do in that situation.

And lastly, my personal favourite - the [b]""slow-mo""[/b] ability Point Man has. This single ability made shootouts segments fun. I never felt overpowered, with death still a possibility if I was careless, and I loved this. I wasn't squatting behind cover the whole game, as I would have in [i]Call of Duty[/i] on its Veteran difficulty. Where is the fun in that? This ability levels the playing field, as enemies are aggressive, and their numbers and teamwork can quickly overwhelm you.

[b]Also, shotgun rounds to the face are infinitely more satisfying in slow-mo, and that's a fact.[/b]

The weapon arsenal is quite diverse and offers you plenty of choice in how you want to approach any given situation. From pistols, shotguns, rocket launchers, and many other weapons, turning enemies into a literal pool of blood has never been this fun. My personal favourites were the dual pistols, shotgun and a very fun particle beam-based sniper that fully [i]undresses[/i] the enemy. But surprise, surprise, there is also melee combat. When you holster your gun, your two personal [i]blunt weapons[/i] come out to play. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2528473757

But, Point Man is also the long lost cousin of Liu Kang and, as such, is familiar with his famous bicycle kick, sending enemies to the [i]Netherrealm[/i]. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, there are also four different grenades. They all go ""boom!"", some quicker than others. As of writing this, the default grenades are tied, with the plasma grenades from [i]Halo Combat Evolved[/i], as my favourite grenades of all time.

[h3][b][i]Yeah...I couldn't think of anything clever for this title, so here is a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ] video of a cat doing cat things[/url][/i][/b][/h3]
The character models and some textures look dated, but I didn't care and nor should you. Some areas you visit do look good, with great set-pieces. But there are also those uninteresting to explore with nothing but brown, grey corridors over and over...looking at you [i]Perseus Mandate[/i].

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2497525200

I love the synergy between the lighting system and the ambience soundtrack. It's the reason for the, sadly very rare, excellent horror segments in [i]Extraction Point[/i]. I did turn off the music, as it gave away the next ""oh shait"" moment. As for the voice acting, it's decent, with our protagonist being the strong silent type. Now gun SFX...Sooooo satisfying. Shooting an enemy in the face, point-blank range with your shotgun, [b]you can feel the impact.[/b]

[h3][b][i]Final Thoughts[/i][/b][/h3]
While it pained me to see its horror potential squandered and the monotonous level design in the base game did cause me some headaches, the shooting felt superb and made up more than enough for these shortcomings. I've never played a game like [i]F.E.A.R.[/i]; Fair and challenging while also being super fun. An enigma, especially for today's landscape where difficulty equals ""bullet sponge"" or ""Aim hack A.I."". 
Buy it. It's that simple.

76561199105224426,1624675366,True,"By far one of the best horror experiences I’ve had with a game. Once you hit the menu, you are greeted with this ominous music, setting the mood for what’s to come. 
Then you enter this dark and grim world, with unforgiving enemies and challenges. The A.I is by far the most intelligent and intuitive out of any game I’ve played so far, they will flank you, communicate with each other, spread out, try to flush you out, and ultimately try their best take you out. 
Every encounter with the A.I is intense, and horrific, the atmosphere is fantastic and the gameplay is incredible, this game makes me want to explore the facility, and rewards me for my adventures, with health kits and equipment. 

 Definitely play this game with a headset and with the lights out for the ultimate F.E.A.R experience!"
76561198136180447,1624664318,True,"What to say, idk, this game feels like it was crafted by a Master Craftsman.

Everything is perfect, the lighting, enemies, sound effects, guns, surprises.

Story is fine as of now, but man, if you want to enjoy the AI, play it at the highest difficulty.

The AI is so well designed along with the levels that it would put modern games to shame. 

The AI does not cheat in higher difficulties. 

This does not feel like a game from 2005.

I Highly recommend this game.

76561197979769489,1624659936,True,"This game aged very, very well. The gunplay is nice and the slow-mo mechanic is fun to use. The horror part is very present and great."
76561198196312963,1624654244,True,"This game saved my life.

I am 55.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you"
76561198879183872,1624644147,True,"Original FEAR. I owned this game back in 2007 in CD and now I found it on Steam. This game combines a nice FPS with a fear factor to keep you on your toes. It has a great story also and it rewards you for going into dark places to face the music. The music is great, build up to show downs and scares.  With so many remakes out there, it is absurd that this one has not gotten one yet.

NOW, this game wasn't designed to run on windows 10 so it might lag at first but you can find easy tutorials on how to fix it in 2 minutes and it will work great. Just a quick search for the video tutorial on youtube and you'll be golden."

76561198028365029,1623978337,True,"As you can tell with my 3.4 hours, this game isn't that long. You could probably do it in an hour if you played on the easiest difficulty and I was on the hardest difficulty.

I will recommend finding the frame rate fix online, so you won't be playing this game in 20fps on newer hardware.

Overall, it's a fun shooter and watching the AI actually try to communicate with each other and flank you. Though this is only really happening in the beginning, when you start getting further on and the levels become just corridors the AI start breaking down.

Short and sweet."
76561198139480922,1623796713,True,"First of all, i have never played this game ever or seen anything of it but holy fucking shit is this one of my new favorite games of all time.
Normally i hate horror games, not because they're scary rather the opposite but mostly because they're boring walking sims in my eyes. But F.E.A.R. was more of a shooter game with some great horror elements that really got me a lot and everything else is also amazing from the level design, music, combat, story and simply the feeling of the entire game.

I'll now go over what i liked and disliked about the main game and the DLC's.

Main game,
the things i enjoyed:
+ The combat while pretty simple at first glance, there's a lot of depth that makes it feel great every time because of multiple reasons i'll go over in a bit.
+ Story is really good IMO, mostly because it leaves you shrouded in mystery. It doesn't explain every little detail because it doesn't need to. I like games that leave you in mystery but only if done well, it explains the things that need explaining and the things that it doesn't explain you can either look it up if you're that interested or you can try to think about it yourself.
+ The scary stuff is really good, it doesn't rely on jump scares 24/7 to keep your attention instead of that there's eerie looking enviroments and music. What i also love about this is that sometimes if there is something scary then you could simply not see it, i guess you could compare it with one of the last scenes of the film 'Hereditary' where you could simply miss the mother floating in the top left corner in the dark.
+ In my last point i said something about the music and well it's great. There's almost always some great track playing in the background. When you're in combat the track is a bit more intense and when you're running around in scary rooms then it's fucking eerie as hell.
+ Level design is really good. There's just something about running around in an office that i enjoy. Ofcourse it's not only an office, in fact there's a lot of different enviroments and every single one feels unique from one another. My favorite is probably the elevator sequence with Alice, this is just perfect.
+ Let's talk about what makes the combat so great. For one it's a leaning mechanic wich you don't really see a lot in old games, the only complaint i have with this is that it isn't a toggle but rather a hold.
+ The really smart AI also makes it a lot more immersive. They're aggressive and will try to flush you out of cover with grenades so you cannot just camp. They also coordinate their attacks through voice so you can react and if you listen close enough you can kind of tell how many troops are left by the intonation of their lines.
+ The gore is also really cool. What i espacially liked is when you are close enough with a shotgun then they sometimes explode in a cloud of blood. 
+ What made the combat probably the best is the ability to slow time and see the physics, gore and animations even better.
+ Physics are also pretty great overall. The ragdolls aren't over the top and feel decently realistic and when you throw a grenade or shoot concrete then it creates clouds. But for some reason the enemies can see through the clouds while you cannot.
+ As for my last point. The villain(s) are so good, they're not just bad because they want to be. They get motivations and i even felt a bit like they were right to do it.

And now for my cons, they're nitpicks but still feel like i should say it.
- You'll need a community file to get some decent fps. 
- Subtitles are really small.
- Minor spoiler for last level, [spoiler] those floating enemies are just horrendous, they're not engaging, scary or interesting at all. [/spoiler]
- I personally like achievements but probably because it's an old game they didn't add it for the steam release.
- It isn't really hard, you could unbind the slowmo button but where's the fun in that.


Extraction point:
Pros:
+ A little bit of new mechanics.
+ New weapons that feel unique.
+ New enemy type.
+ Entirely new level design that feel unique from the main game.
+ A little bit harder
+ Doubles down on the horror aspect, this makes it a lot scarier than the main game.
+ Voice mail is instant.
+ Everything good about the main game is still great and some things are even better.
+ Major spoiler, [spoiler] the way one of the characters named 'Holiday' get's killed is so fucking great and left me even a bit baffled at how violent it was. [/spoiler]

Cons:
- To get 1080p you'll have to get into a config file. It's the settings.cfg in FEARXP.
- After a certain level i had to play on 1280x720 because if i played any higher then it wouldn't load and i also had to set my video settings to medium because otherwise i only had about 40 fps. Only the resolution would be for the rest of the game but at least it was close to the end.
- After having played the main game it get's a bit too predictable whenever you're in a hallway.
- Like my last point, it follows a lot of the same tropes so again it gets a bit predictable at times. 
- Voice acting is a big downgrade, especially the voicemails.
- It isn't cannon according to the original devs.
- Dell was clearly a sponsor.


Perseus Mandate:
Pros:
+ It's different in the way of level design but mostly because it's more action oriented than scary.
+ The flashlight has a bigger battery.

Cons:
- New AR is so boring and is almost the same as the normal one but with an annoying, ugly red scope.
- Story is not engaging at all
- Not scary, this made it feel more generic.
- The new enemy types are so fucking stupid.
- Again after a certain level it crashed wich made me lower the settings so i could keep on playing. But fafter the initial load i could maximize it again.
- As for last it is again not cannon according to the original devs and maybe for the better.


So overall i absolutely adored the main game, loved the first DLC and thought the last one was alright.
I really recommend playing the main game and first DLC, for the last one i'd still recommend it but only if you already love the other games. If i were to rate these 3 it's probably something like:
Main game:  9.6/10
XP:             8.7/10
PM:               6.5/10

"
76561198157453094,1623758921,True,"After all these years, the first F.E.A.R. game still impresses with its sophisticated game mechanics and the way that it successfully blends very different genres. I played F.E.A.R. 2 a while back and absolutely loved it. I love both games. They are very similar but at the same time, also very different.

In F.E.A.R., you play as the Point-Man as you enter a large building complex. As you progress through the building, you encounter lots of disturbing visions with a creepy ghost girl following you.

You have to fight against many soldiers. Thanks to the game's brilliant A.I., they act like a real squad. You can hear their radio chatter as they try to organise themselves against you. The layouts of the areas often allow them to flank your position. This is far more sophisticated than the enemies in the Call Of Duty, Battlefield, Medal Of Honour or Halo games. F.E.A.R.'s enemy A.I. is better than enemy A.I. in any other game I've played (including F.E.A.R. 2). Thankfully, you have the ability to slow down time like Max Payne. It's great watching the grenades or shotgun blasts decimate your enemies in slow-motion. All the weapons are great. 

The game does a good job at creating an intense and disturbing environment but I think F.E.A.R. 2 was scarier.

F.E.A.R. does have some problems. While I like the claustrophobic environment, it does get a bit boring walking around a generic office building for most of the game. The game is also very dark so you have to use a torch but the torch keeps needing to recharge and that just becomes tedious. Also, while the enemies are fantastic, it does get a bit dull just fighting the same types of enemies for most of the game. Because everything looks the same and some backtracking is involved, I sometimes got lost and found myself wandering around aimlessly for minutes at a time. While many of the scares are effective, you can easily miss a lot of them if you aren't looking in the right direction (you can still hear the sounds). [spoiler]The whole twist with the fat man being a bad guy was so predictable.[/spoiler]

As much as I love this game, I think F.E.A.R. 2 brought some much needed variety to the gameplay and locations. F.E.A.R. controls very tightly and it looks good considering its age. Sadly, the multiplayer is no longer available.

F.E.A.R. is a great game that feels like it takes many of the best elements from games such as Max Payne and Half-Life. I also noticed the heavy influence of action films such as Die Hard, John Woo's Hard Boiled and The Matrix trilogy. The game also takes a lot from J-Horror movies such as Ring and The Grudge and some sequences reference The Shining. I recommend checking this game out.

Gameplay: 8.5/10
Graphics: 8/10 (for the time)
Controls: 8/10
Replay Value: 3/10"
76561198311985892,1623742105,True,"I had never played F.E.A.R. until June 11, 2021. That is when I started this fantastic game. This game's atmosphere, tension, and high octane combat make for an overwhelmingly enjoyable experience. It does take a little work to get the game to work with modern systems, which is something to be expected with a game released in 2005. The fixes are simple however since this game has a phenomenal community of people. There's so many details that didn't need to be in this game, but are. For example, holstering, something that took Ubisoft until Far Cry 5 to implement, is in this game, for no conceivable reason other than the devs wanted to try to make the game as realistic as possible, which apparently a lot of people did think this looked realistic back then :joy:. Another example would be the melee combat, something that I didn't personally use, had such flare and variety of moves for an FPS that it really surprised me. The AI is far smarter than some AI in current video games, which REALLY threw me for a spin. It's adrenaline inducing in combat, and it's horrifying in the dark This game successfully pulled me in for every second. 

[b]My Rating: 8.5/10[/b] (I am torn between an 8/10 or 9/10, please check my system below)
[b]I highly recommend purchasing this three title pack when it is on sale, or on humble bundle during a sale, I got it for ~$10.[/b]

I had one glitch occur that was fixed by quicksaving and quickloading. You will run into runtime errors, it's an old game on new hardware, it's expected. Just close the game and load up a save. If you are interested in partaking in the multiplayer experience of a bygone age, the community has come with a way to return to such a time, with players peaking at 50-100 per day on average. 

As for the expansions: [b]Extraction Point[/b] and [b]Perseus Mandate[/b], I give these two games 
[b]7.5/10 and 6.5/10, respectively.[/b] 
Perseus Mandate is more combat focused than base game, having few horror sections. Extraction Point was a continuation of F.E.A.R.'s ending and came to a reasonable conclusion. It should be noted, these DLCs are considered an alternate timeline as they were made by Timegate Studios and published by Vivendi Games. The main number titles are considered the ""Monolith Timeline"" as they follow the story in the direction that Monolith intended for the game from the get go. Convolution comes from Warner Bros acquiring Monolith during the development of F.E.A.R., so Vivendi owned the name, Monolith owned the characters and story.

76561199144413172,1623292617,True,"Love this pack. Particular issues with Extraction Point. That DLC runs like crap and fixes don't seem to work for the bundled version.

However, even without EP, this package is well worth it."
76561199017003599,1623258621,True,"Even for a game made in 2005, the game still feels great and everything from how the levels are structured and how the AI interacts with it to the combat, which still feels fresh within the FPS genre, make this game great.  If there is anything I have issue with, there's three things: one, this game isn't really a horror game in the way Resident Evil is or Silent Hill, and if it weren't for the gore and atmosphere this would be a thriller game; two, the level designs are kind of drab, even for this time.  The layout of the levels is fantastic and I have a hard time finding anything wrong with that aspect, but the aesthetic of the levels (i.e. the colors and set pieces) are all very samey: cement floors and ceilings, electrical boxes, everything you would find in the basement of a hotel essentially.  Such a breath of fresh air when you make it to the headquarters, however, even that starts off with the cement floors and such.  My final issue with the game is the enemy type.  I know that they are clones and that the common consensus is that there isn't going to be much difference because of that.  I won't go into how to fix these enemies, even if they are clones, but just know when the assassins show up it is another breath of fresh air because they provide a different dynamic from the standard soldiers.  All of these problems aren't that huge for me, as I obviously love the game, I just want to put it out there that there are some elements I took issue with that may impact other players when they play.  I feel incredibly neutral about two things: the story and the scares.  The story is kind of bland, although it is unique enough to keep you invested, so whatever.  And the scares are more or less jumpscares, even though the atmosphere of the game overall is very tense and unnerving.  I could care less about that aspect, as something like that is to be expected with a game literally called FEAR.  If you find issue with these aspects, I understand, but really truly it is the gameplay that covers so many of these bumps and bruises because it is so spectacular.  This is a must play for people who are fans of FPS games and horror games."

76561199053061104,1622915871,True,"I became a Fan of FEAR when I bought it for my Xbox 360 Back in 2006 for Christmas. 
The Story is simple. You're part of a task force that is trained to deal with Paranormal activities, You're new to the team and the team is called F.E.A.R. Once you reach your destination things go wrong, simple enough. 
The Characters and Enemies are not great and the levels can feel like its the same old thing. Regardless of that its without question absolutely dreadful and creepy, and with Alma running around she just adds the tension. What I love about her is that she pops up unexpectedly and they use her perfectly. Watch out Players sometimes she runs round giggling in the corridors. I love the gun fighting and the combat and after all these years it still feels playable. Yup the price for this collection is overpriced, but IMO Its well worth it they are some of the finest Old School Horror Games you will ever find. Except for FEAR 3 (YUCK!!!)"

This game was well ahead of it's time in many ways and will forever be a classic FPS. If you want to play it for that specific reason like myself, fine.

76561198017968325,1621958063,True,"Playing this in 2021, still a great game. Holds up well, slo mo shooting physics are awesome."
76561198004564438,1621872395,True,"Edit: You can't buy F.E.A.R. on Steam currently without buying ALL F.E.A.R. games in the entire series, so either wait or buy it someplace else. F.E.A.R. 2 is F.E.A.R. but worse, and F.E.A.R. 3 is terrible.

F.E.A.R. is an all-time best shooter, and it's for some strange reasons.

First the negatives: the game has graphics from 15 years ago, enemy A.I. that is nothing outstanding, generic weapons, and bullet time/slow motion was an aging concept when the game came out.

But then there are the positives:

GRAPHICS & SOUND:

The difference between graphic quality and how the game LOOKS is literally day and night. As in lighting. There is dynamic light EVERYWHERE. Dark is pitch black, you can shoot lights, see enemy shadows to know their location, and the dynamic shadows of every person/object completely overshadow (pun unintentional) the aging texture quality. Then there are the particle effects. When you shoot someone in FEAR, it's a show. Enemies react appropriately, and any bullets that miss will WRECK the room. Holes in walls, items taking damage or shatter, and every hit will make sparks/splinters fly within a meter radius. Even the gun sounds are a highlight. The bass sound from the guns is its own encouragement to shoot more and larger weapons.

GAMEPLAY:

Then there's the actual gameplay, which is equally outstanding. The enemy AI is legendary. Enemy soldiers (well, the main soldiers at least, which are most enemies) hunt in packs. When you shoot one enemy, there are probably at least 3 more in the immediate area.

Let me describe a generic encounter. When you see an enemy, he might be on patrol and be an easy target. After you shoot him, a nearby soldier might shout ""He's here!"" followed by ""He's behind the sofa/office chair/television/aquarium/wall/door/minivan/seemingly any in-game object."" The game makers recording dozens, probably hundreds of dialogue lines just for spotting you. Then the soldiers take cover (knocking over any nearby furniture to use as cover) and start firing, so you take cover. While one soldier keeps you pinned down, another might flank you. The maps allow them to flank you. A third soldier might burst in through a wall/door/ceiling.

Fortunately, you can take care of yourself. You have a bar of time-slowing (I guess you have fast reflexes) you can use at any time, which is good for lining up shots quickly while moving. Also, did I mention you know taekwondo? You can melee people with your gun, but you can also kick. Jump-melee is a roundhouse, run-jump-melee is a dropkick, and run-crouch-melee is a slide tackle. And struck enemies will go flying like they're trying to get you sent off the pitch. It's a guilty pleasure.

STORY:

Without spoilers, I'll say it's a competent horror-ish story with a scary little girl with her long hair covering her face. Maybe there's some scifi here, some supernatural there, but it will mostly come together by the end of the game. It gets a little sparse during some of the office level, but trust me it picks up again afterward.

CONCLUSION:

Buy/play F.E.A.R. and give it an hour or two. Play on the hardest difficulty to appreciate the full enemy A.I. in action. It's still not that hard, and if you die it's because you made a mistake you can immediately see, and (temporary) death feels like an appropriate punishment.

After F.E.A.R., play the Extraction Point expansion (for the gameplay to be ramped up several levels of intensity). Stay away from Perseus Mandate. It was developed by seemingly a single modder who then experienced budget cuts. The dynamic lighting is gone, the gun sounds are worse; just don't do it.

F.E.A.R. 2 is F.E.A.R. 1 remade, but without the dynamic lighting, particle physics, and gun sound satisfaction. It has better textures, by the story also takes a hit.

F.E.A.R. 3 is....well, I can't say it's bad, but only because I can't get myself to play it. I've heard too many bad things. If you're curious and it's on sale, still ignore it. Stick with F.E.A.R., FEAR: Extraction Point, and maybe F.E.A.R. 2 if you want more and can lower your standards. Perseus Mandate isn't a finished game, and F.E.A.R. 3 has a rough reputation."

Loved playing it. The only concern being it too lengthy to start and repetitive enemies in single gameplay. But since its 15 years old that's expected. Eagerly waiting to play the DLCs and FEAR2 and FEAR3. I just hope they have done justice to the amazing story line."
76561198202898160,1620255867,True,"It really is not a scary game, though it has its moments and many more weird scare tactics that are more funny than scary. Maybe it is because I played this little after I played dead space. Combat and AI is fantastic with great weapons and definitely passable graphics. The story is not anything original but it kept me somewhat interested throughout the campaign."
76561198049843914,1620164893,True,Firing the shotgun in this game makes me cum each and every single time.

Otherwise probably 9/10 fps, ai is better than most game ai today, gunplay is pretty good very similar to half life 1. Slow motion and level design make the game interesting. Gore is very well done. Horror element and tensions are done very well also. Definitely worth picking up if you want a good fps to play.

Expansions are included in most versions of this. They're okay and are enjoyable enough because the core gameplay is the same but meh otherwise, lack the tensions and horror and some other things."

on the other side a killing machine, who is made to silence all the witnesses,

probably programmed some way, this is 'you' then,

As P. Fettel points out, everyone he kills, direct or indirect,

'they all deserved to die'

Sounds like one is pretty evil, however, alma seems corrupt and possessed by and/or spawning ghosts, well, this seems a bad sign as well. 

Indicated that Fettel be controlled by alma ('my thoughts or hers'... 'it makes no difference'..)

The game's conclusion seems to be: Don't be a lapdog, whatever the cost, of somebody else, this was what lead to alma being manipulated and dying being abused, and what leads the 'point man', who one plays in game to do all the meaningless slavery, basically..

I will not say what, out of fear for censoring, but almost like the game predicted something would happen, that would be likely to lead to giving freedom of choice and such out of hands, well, this was compared, the game, and inspired from some supposed secret chinese project, again, probably cannot mention the name.. probably, well, I forgot too, if it did happen, it be out there somewhere maybe still, but, playing the game, one can think and guess I suppose"

76561198372615064,1618939685,True,"Did you know? They called it F.E.A.R for reasons - it spooked the hell out of you with the atmosphere, and it also scared your PC sh*tless back in 2005 with the specs. 

Anyway, here are the reviews for the main game and both expansions, single-player only:

Main game F.E.A.R - [b]9/10[/b]:
+ The most fun slowmo bloody-n-explosive combat
+ Longest playing of the whole series 
+ Great, dreadful atmosphere, ambiance
+ Great, smart AI
+ While it relies on jumpscares, not a lot do feel cheap, and some are actually clever as well.
+ Textures still hold up today (not counting outdoor area)
+ Good physics and interactions
+ Good enough storyline
+ Balanced items placement
- No boss fights

Extraction Point – 8/10:
+ Still fun slowmo gun-fu combat
+ New weapons and enemies
+ Good continuity on main game ending
+ Has new creative jumpscares
- Crashes at Interval 4 onward unless medium world details
- Still no boss fights
- Not really a satisfying ending
- Need to edit config for desired resolution

Perseus Mandate – 7.5/10:
+ Even new weapons and enemies
+ Finally has decent boss fights
+ Longer than Extraction Point (7 hrs compared to 5 hrs)
+ Interesting take on parallel view of main game events
- The scares got much less effective, still got a few unique nonetheless
- With enemies getting OP dmg with new guns, the pacing tends toward peak-and-shoot rather fun risking like previous games
- The final boss is just blatant spamming
- New weapons actually render old guns unused a lot
- Need to edit config for desired resolution
- Minor issue for all – small subtitle size, requires modding, the crouch dash was not really intuitive to use

Therefore, grab the whole pack on sale, it is cheap and worth it (except FEAR 3)
"
76561198388752707,1618882243,True,FUCKING FUN. Play on hard cause its basically normal difficulty. Headphones are a definite requirement and the particle weapon is the best gun in the game.
76561198338617352,1618879775,True,Great video game A.I
76561197999968364,1618829053,True,A classic for a reason
76561198076645868,1618814430,True,"Fun game, but definitely showing its age.

Visually, it's pretty bland. Lots of greys, dull reds, browns, and every other interior is either an office, or industrial-esque. Few moments where they mix it up, but not going so far as to not have it all be variations of brown.

Weapon variety is pretty uninspired, too, with a couple of standouts (the particle weapon, and the HV Penetrator). 

Where this game comes into its own is just how well it enables the combat to take place. Maps are--while dull--open ended, with lots of room for yourself and the AI to position, flank, etc. Grenades and mines all can be detonated with gunfire, and when you start chucking in the bullet-time mode into the mix, you can get some ridiculously fun gunfights that lean very, very heavily on the rule of cool. Shooting a grenade that an enemy threw while you're running through an area spraying and praying in slo-mo... really doesn't get old in a hurry.

Something else that the game does well that folks have a tendency of... over-stating is how fun the enemies are to fight. They're pretty stock standard, but they play aggressively, and they call out what they're doing, what they're experiencing, and their current 'mood'. The simple fact that the game consistently vocalises enemy intentions does wonders for immersion, and gives a dimension of complexity to the AI that, in all honesty, isn't really there. The illusion of it, however, is more than enough.

Story is pretty rote, but the delivery is fantastic and this game does jump-scares *extremely* well. 

10/10 would not climb a ladder again.

Side note: Definitely go via the pcgaming wiki and install the framerate fix there, because FEAR can get very choppy on some modern configurations without it."
76561198131329298,1618794328,True,"Its okay, I guess. I never played this before but I enjoyed it quite a bit. 

Its not too much of a hassle to run despite its age, merely an additional DLL and compatibility mode. 

As for the game itself, the shooting is top notch and it really holds up well. Its actually refreshing to go back to something without ADS. Everyone talks about the AI, but its really nothing that special. Merely it just communicates with the player and interacts with the environment in a way that seems genuine and tactical. Its ironic that a game were you fight a clone army the enemies have more character and perhaps realism than pretty much everything out there, even today. I found the game really easy, and that was playing on the hardest difficulty and my first ever play-through, it was more a thing of reloading saves to get the most satisfying run-through of an area than actually dying. The weapons are all great to use, minus the remote grenades and mines. Grenades chew through regular infantry but nothing else. The heavy enemies were also kind of annoying, because while everything else takes merely a few head shots or less, the heavy enemies are serious tanks that had me confused even after I had finished the game, I still wonder if there was some kind of weak point or something or if they were meant to just tank disproportionate to everything else. I don't mean to say they are difficult, rather the game goes from speeding along as slow-mo Rambo to a slow cover shooter where even the endgame weapons need 4 hits to kill. For example in the final mission there is two robo-chickens with rockets right after each other, I spent all of my 30 cannon shots to kill the first one and then had kill the second one with over 200 rounds of the rifle, it ruins the pacing worse than the story.

For the horror and story, it reminded me a lot of Max Payne. Actually the whole thing feels that way, campy story, bullet time, and really shitty story levels where the flow of game is ruined. The flashbacks and horror segments here are no where near as bad as in Max Payne, but they are far more mindless as you cannot take damage and there isn't shitty platforming. The game starts off horror heavy and then it just kind of disappears, which is nice. The game would do better withan option to disable the story, as it limits the replay value. I know I won't touch Max Payne again because of how slow and boring the flashbacks at the beginning are. FEAR for sure has a great atmosphere and whatnot tho, don't get me wrong. It's just if I ever come back to this game it won't be because there is a harmless low poly little girl hiding in a dark corner, its because the shooting and AI were really fun."
76561198055697957,1618777591,True,Just a really well polished old game. great AI for its time.
76561198005061122,1618755638,True,[h1]WE WANT A REMASTERED!
76561198013026902,1618712662,True,"I'd had this game in my library for a while, but just got around to playing it recently.  Great game!

 ~ The story and world are linear, but still interesting.  It's billed as a ""horror"" game, and it is, in a sense.  But if you are looking for cheesy, over-the-top-gore ""slasher film"" type of horror, this isn't it (although the game does have some bloody scenes).  If you are looking for lots of jump scares, this game doesn't have them (very few, at any rate).  I'd characterize it as more of a ""creeping dread"" supernatural suspense/thriller type of horror.

 ~ The action and combat are very well done.  Most of the weapons are good.  The starting pistol is surprisingly useful and remains a viable choice throughout the game, which is nice considering the starting weapon in most FPS games is often a crap weapon that gets permanently discarded the second the player finds something better.  I also like how this game lets the player dual-wield the pistol, gunslinger-style!  Lastly, the main character's Matrix-style ""bullet time"" ability is fun...and useful.

 ~ I think this game came out over 15 years ago, so the graphics are a bit dated, but still look good considering the age of the game.  I've seen some reviews from other players that contain complaints about how poorly this game runs on modern systems with wide resolution screens, specifically about how they were getting frame rates in the teens.  I'm not saying their complaints aren't legit, but it wasn't my experience with this game.  When I started the game and switched the resolution to 2560x1080, the game did pop up a disclaimer message saying that the game wasn't optimized for this resolution, but the game ended up running just fine.  My framerates were consistently around 50-55 FPS -- not stellar by any means, but still completely acceptable.  I never had issues stuttering, lagging, or with the framerates dropping into the teens.

I had fun with this one, and I'd definitely recommend the game.
My only gripes were that the game is a bit short (I finished the entire thing in just under 15 hours), and that none of the guns have usable iron sights."
76561198206182151,1618689813,True,If you like kicking people in slow motion this is the game for you.
76561198047733360,1618688412,True,"Jesus, how come this game is so old ,but so good?"
76561197970613265,1618686688,True,"The shooting is fantastic fun and the horror is serviceably creepy. I think the gunplay with the ai hold up to keep the game relevant. I will concede that there is a jarring metaphorical crunch of gears when the game shifts between them, on the whole."
76561198366502326,1618675654,False,"I think this game is probably like predominantly for people who have nostalgia for it. Trying to play it for the first time now I just found it annoying. Endless cut-scenes, overly complex controls trying to incorporate every mechanic ever. A product of its time (and I generally like retro shooters)."
76561198020225761,1618668149,True,"Even if you've never played F.E.A.R. before, you definitely, heard about it. And if you heard - you already know that one of the main reasons why F.E.A.R. is loved so much - that's outstanding AI. And that is absolute truth. The level of AI is phenomenal and for 15 years it puts to shame other AAA FPSs with their braindead bots, who exist only to give you some loot and experience points.

You won't see here overpowered enemies with 10 layers of armor, which notice you through walls and one shot from any distance like in many other pseudo-hardcore games. 99% of enemies here are just soldiers who can be killed with just one shot. And enemies here behave... naturally. Yep, that's the best way to describe their behavior. Every encounter with enemies gives special experience and they are never the same.

Enemies are comunicating with each other and adequately report the situation. They aggressively use environment for their benefit: flipping tables and boxes for more cover, jumping from the balconies, breaking windows and other obstacles to find some shortcuts to your position. They are using a lot of grenades and actively flanking you. This is very common situation when few enemies pin you down with supressive fire in the main room, while single soldier is bypassing you around via some utility room to shoot you from behind or finish with a melee.

You can try to use mines against them, but if you place your traps in a bad place - they can easily notice them and just walk around or even shoot them if you are nearby. By the way, you definitely like to blow up enemies by shooting at nearby explosives in other FPSs, right? Local enemies love to shoot at explosives even more! The moment they will spot some explosive barrel or, let's say, fire extinguisher near you - they will shoot it to decorate the room with your bodyparts.

Their animations are very rich as well. They cautiously walk, run, squat and even crawl. If they need - they jump over obstacles or even from above floors. When they hide behind the walls - they cautiously peek out with their guns. When severely wounded - they limp away while shooting backwards and calling for reinforcements.

But hey, I'm talking so much about AI, so you may get wrong impression that F.E.A.R. is just about that. But that's not true. The game is absolutely self-sufficient. It has intriguing story, great horror stuff, thrilling music and gameplay/shooting mechanics even without fantastic AI are great as well. 

Your arsenal is rather humble (nearly a dozen of weapons), but compared to other BF and CoD titles with their hundreds of reskins of the same gun, each gun here really looks and acts differently. Different recoil, different ammo, different damage to environment, different kind of damage to enemies. Some weapons use classic bullets, some of them blow enemies to pieces, other - can pin them to walls or even ceilings. Some guns shoot with such heavy impact that they tear off bodyparts. There are even some experimental guns which strip enemies from their flesh with one shot, leaving only skeletons in puddles of blood.

As to the story and horror aspects - developers were scooping the inspiration from Japanese horrors, so you may rest assured that everythng is twisted just as needed: paranormal stuff, disturbing atmosphere, vague edge between present and otherworldy, etc, etc.

A word about cons? Some minor game mechanics are outdated at this moment. And leveldesign may look not very presentable. I mean, in most cases it's just 50 shades of gray offices. Condemned: Criminal origins did better job here. But nevertheless, maybe leveldesign here is not an eye candy - it is a great ""polygon"" for AI, where it can demonstrate it's full potential.

Overall - strongly recommend. One of the best shooters of all times. 15 years ago I could not even believe that I'm holding a game that was ahead of it's time. But one word about the price. Like other people here already mentioned, standard price on Steam is kinda meh. Yeah, you pay for entire francise, but it's still kinda too much. Even more, F.E.A.R. 2 and F.E.A.R. 3 are rather mediocre and far from what I would recommend, so, in fact, you are buying this bundle just for original F.E.A.R. and 2 it's expansions ""Extraction point"" and ""Perseus mandate"". Thus, if you want to get it on Steam - get it on sale. Luckily it rather often gets 75% off.

*          *          *          *          *

Since there is no way to review ""Extraction point"" and ""Perseus mandate"" separately, I'll do it here. Imagine the situation: total outsiders without much experience in ""X genre"" development take your precious francise and... create great expansions. Impossible, right? In 99,9% this is indeed so. But every rule has it's exceptions. And here we have exactly such case. Studio, specialized in strategy (???) games for real created 2 great expansions for F.E.A.R. Yeah, there are few minor canonic conflicts, but nevertheless, both expansions were so harmonically implemented into the main game, that it was impossible to notice that they were not created by the original developers.

I'd even say, these expansions managed to improve the game a little, expand the story and add more variety to arsenal and local ""bestiary"". They are, of course, shorter than main game, which is also good (because main game may seem liitle overextended somewhere in the middle). As to the cons - probably I could mention leveldesign. It's not bad, it simply became little more linear, so AI got little less space for it's tricks. 

Thus - great expansions for original game. I find it very unfair, appaling and even shameful that these expansions were excluded from the official F.E.A.R. canon."

76561199042043492,1617570368,True,"[h1]The real masterpice of the linear horror fps games for ALL TIMES[/h1]

For FEAR 1 it's definitely a masterpiece of linear horror fps games, in my mind it's only one level lower than the HL series which is the real top 1 of the horror fps. 
It shows a lot of features that really only belong to  FEAR, like the seperation of the scary part and the battle parts (althrough some enemies could already scare the shit out of u), and that will let u know that which part u're facing on. Some people like it and some dislike it, i'm with the guys who like it; And the most important part is the enemies' AI, these're some real INTELLIGENT shit. Their reacts in the battle against u will make you really need take fxxking hundred precents serious with every battle, and u really need that Bullet Time for organizing ur fight. Sometimes even a lil careless could make u ready to go back to the damn save point. Their varied tactics are not only due to the AI, the terrain also plays a big role. U can go sneaking to their back, and they can also encircle u from ur back. That's the Essence of this game.
Talking to its weakness, it's the story, really a lil bit weak, cuz if u wanna know the story u must litsen to all the messages (althrough it's not hard to find all), the info from the main storyline will only coufuse u, that's a real shxtty point.
This game has been able to bring some sense of age from its graphic, but in the overall aspect this is a real good game that has stood the test of time."

76561198971236759,1617519845,False,Amazing physics and enemy ai. Level design hasnt aged well. I cant recommend this especially for the extreme price unless you look up some gameplay first. It was a blast back in the day but I have to keep looking up guides for some ladder or vent hidden in shadow that only becomes obvious after the fact and after a LOT of back tracking.
76561198069214840,1617492083,True,Good game but buy it on GOG or a keystore if you just want it and it's expansions.
76561198073583667,1617458725,True,"[h1] TL;DR, the game is fantastic, but you can get a better deal elsewhere (link in review) [/h1]

Having recently binged the entire FEAR series of games, expansions, third game, and all, I can solidly say that this is by far the best.

You've likely heard that the gunfights perfectly emulate the John Woo feeling of chaos, particularly that of [i] Hard Boiled[/i], and you've heard correctly.  As much as I enjoy the sequels, none of them come close to the pure euphoria that this game brings out with its over-the-top ragdolls, environmental effects, and dynamic lighting.

This game also has the best horror of the FEAR series.  Granted, I'd say that most of it isn't all that scary, but every attempt to scare the player leaves a far greater impact than all the QTEs and blurry vision of the sequels.  The expansions to this game, in my opinion, absolutely nail the horror, with a good combination of spooky spirits in the dark and surreal environments that feel almost reminiscent of [i] Cry of Fear[/i].

[h1] HOWEVER [/h1]

I do not recommend that you purchase the game on Steam unless you're willing to pay almost $60 for the entire series.  While I do enjoy every game in this franchise, I don't enjoy being forced to buy all of them in order to play the first one.  For that reason, I advise that you buy this game from [url=https://www.gog.com/game/fear_platinum] GOG.com [/url], which not only features both of the expansion packs, but only costs $10 when not on sale (and at the time of writing this review, it is on sale for $2.5).

If you want this game on Steam, I highly recommend you wait for the collection to go on sale and be ready to shill out some extra cash for the entire franchise.  Like I've said earlier, I enjoy and recommend every FEAR game, so if you're willing to purchase them all, then by all means, do so."

I recently played it again, and it has held up well. It wasn't just a nostalgia trip... it's genuinely good with an oppressive atmosphere you just want to escape by reaching those end credits.

76561197969267280,1617238103,True,"Everything about the title and description of this game reeks of hyperbolic sensationalism. Naming a horror game ""Fear."" is strike one. Basing a few of the characters on early 2000s Japanese horror movie cliches is strike two. Basing pretty much the rest of the plot and characters on late 90s Japanese horror video game tropes is strike three. There's even a shoot-dodge mechanic. It sounds awful--lame and tired. The weird thing is, I'll be damned if it doesn't actually work. Somehow, all of it manages to come together and produce a genuinely fun and interesting game with incredible fire-fights and some terrifying and memorable moments. Somehow, magically, it completely avoids being lame, tired, or played out.

Unfortunately 90% of the time you'll be using the assault riffle as it's pretty much the only thing dropped by enemies, but even this is still fun to use.

It leans more into being an FPS than a horror game. The game features fantastic AI, a dismemberment system, bullet time, and a solid assortment of weapons. My only major gripe was with the level design that often had me feeling like I was stumbling across my destination by accident. 

F.E.A.R. cannot be bought individually so I would really only recommend it to those who are confident about their interest in the series.

It took me about 7 hours to beat F.E.A.R. and I don't know if I would replay it. There is a multiplayer mode but official support ended in 2012 with the end of Gamespy's Gamespy Open Program leaving only unofficial community mods. The game worked great on Linux with Proton without any tweaking though I did have some issues with controls in the water and guns appearing translucent.

76561198427556131,1616424321,True,"Just completed my first play through of the game and I had a good time with it even if it isn't quite what I expected. 
If you would like to see gameplay I am in the process of finishing up my let's play of the game on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pndSAgqRqkU&list=PLpZbQgCgA0y6ooWvAu9jmq0BC22mWSwAf

What I mean by that is 99% of the combat is against clone soldiers and security. I don't feel like that's an exaggeration either. Combat can feel very chaotic at times though which I enjoyed. Map designs are well thought out for the AI that they created and I would find my self getting flanked, surprised, and spoiled for choice by them on quite a few occasions. After finding out that a lot of the rooms were connected often offering multiple points of entry I would scout an area whenever I'd see a fork in the road, drop some mines at places where I think enemies would choose to go whether it be in a doorway, in front of a window, etc. and sit still popping shots at them until I could hear that they got caught in my explosives on the other. Then I'd pop to either side to finish off the rest. There's a lot to appreciate about what the developers have done here, the soldiers will even push over things like crates and vending machines for added cover. I will say though as a negative that the AI is comically less effective in larger open areas.

The themes of the levels might let you down a bit with it's style, though this is purely subjective. I found myself chuckling at the amount of times I would return to the sewers or would be shooting up an office building.

The point-man (a.k.a. you) has a very interesting ability. His reflexes. They allow him to essentially slow time which I had a lot of fun with even though it does two things for me mainly: 
1. Pretty much negates a lot of the difficulty in combat situations, causing me to feel guilt for embarrassing super soldiers.
2. Makes me question if the game has a morality system.
The game of course doesn't have a morality system. But the soldiers would appear to be scared of fighting you at times which had me thinking that things were a tad more nuanced than they actually were. There were moments where I would look for more of a pacifist route but no dice. Just tear down the opposition when you're only one man strong every time.

Enemy types are few and range in complexity. Hands down the best were the clone soldiers for me. They use all of the weapons you do in the game and have been given the most attention. The worst were easily the turrets (thankfully they were rarely used). All they would do is rain fire on your last known location or lock onto you if they could see you and loved to take a lot of my ammo.

There are messages that you can listen to on phones and laptops that you can get some exposition from. I thought the addition of two forms of what basically amounts to audio logs in the game was kind of weird until I realized every single laptop in the game is an alienware. Product placement ftw. Nothing wrong with it inherently, I guess. But the fact that they pop up everywhere in the game I found to be a bit jarring. I could be wrong but I doubt scientists involved in supernatural top secret projects would be using a gaming laptop for their work. It's even harder to believe that people who work in a water processing plant would be using the same. That's one hell of a boss that shells out the cash for gaming laptops.

If you'll allow me to be a bit of a pessimist for a moment: Much of what I see in this game reeks of tech demo. Not unlike DOOM 3. You can interact with a lot of things in the environment, though you'll quickly find that it gets annoying to do so. Kicking a can makes a painful amount of sound even if it only moves a few inches, binders will twitch and open when you're within a few feet of them, rolling chairs refuse to budge without a running start, pill bottles make noise and bounce around. I think it was common for the time to try to make all of these things interaction friendly. I wouldn't miss it if it were gone but it's not a deal breaker that it's there. Everything violently reacting to my presence just annoys me after a while.

In closing I'll talk about the BIGGEST SPOILER of the game. DO NOT READ PAST THIS IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME UNHINDERED BY KNOWLEDGE!!!!!

Something I was becoming less and less a fan of was everything involving Alma and Fettel. Most interactions were scripted and sparsely scattered throughout the campaign. I was pretty disappointed to find this out because once you know these two are basically no threat to you at all I took them a lot less seriously. Alma is absolutely no threat to you until she is trying to hug you at the very end of the game. Which makes sense if you have context but you don't start getting hints for that until you're pretty far along in the campaign. Fettel is never a threat to you. The only supernatural things other than end-game Alma that are harmful to you are these weird fleshy spirit things that come after you in dream events that go down in one shot and do negligible damage if you let them get close enough. Alma is basically a jump scare tool whereas Fettel is an exposition dumper which I'm sad to say after beating the game because Alma's story is a solid mass of depressing terror. She is very much a victim and I didn't want to shoot her at all once I learned what happened to her but she'd kill me if I didn't so...bang bang."
76561198215313349,1616381955,True,"one of the greatest shooters of all time. it's insane the genre never progressed beyond this point. The 2 biggest things that make FEAR the greatest are the way the AI interacts with the map layouts and the way your carnage is painted across the arenas in the form of blood splatters, bullet holes, and smoke resting in the air. Shooting the ever living sh*t out of a room of enemies then turning around and looking at everything you just did before moving on is always satisfying. Play on hard difficulty."

76561198055141093,1615803484,True,"Let me just start this review by stating that this game is an absolute [i]blast[/I] to play and one of the most critically acclaimed shooters of all time for good reason, though it's not completely perfect. 

The atmosphere of this game isn't quite like any other I've ever played, and the overall tone of the game just [I]feels[/I] like you're actually in this universe. The developers use limited directional lighting to set the mood, and while I wouldn't say it really makes it that scary (save for a few jump scares at the end), the way it ties into combat means you have to tackle different parts of the game in different ways.

The story is just...ok, but the world building and mystery surrounding it paired with a distinctive setting make for a truly unique experience. However, characters in this game generally range from completely forgettable to downright infuriating caricatures of overdone stereotypes, but overall it's not really a deal breaker.

The combat is absolutely spectacular, but it does have its drawbacks. For one thing, a lot of the combat scenarios will play out relatively the same unless you actively alter your play style frequently, which does help make it more interesting. All the weapons save for the SMG and Assault Rifle IMO feel great to use, but I've gotta say that gunning down a group of enemies in slow motion with dual pistols or a shotgun makes you feel pretty badass. As for the AI, they're better than most AI even in a lot of modern games. They'll flank you, bait you, work as a cohesive team, make callouts, retreat, or push all depending on how you play and how many soldiers they have. The AI isn't 100% perfect, though, as sometimes they'll just walk straight into your shotgun, stand still without trying to take cover, or won't pressure you even if they have a numbers advantage. 

A lot of people praise the movement in the game and I will admit it's fairly decent [I]for the time[/I], but it hasn't aged nearly as well as say the movement in Half-Life 1 & 2 and feels [I]extremely[/I] heavy in comparison. Some people will prefer it, others won't, and personally I don't.

Overall I do recommend this game but I don't recommend you buy it directly from Steam. Buy it from the Humble Bundle instead and just activate it on Steam. If you do buy it, though, just know that the game might launch at an unplayable frame rate and you'll have to find a fix online, but fortunately there are really easy fixes to pretty much all the major performance issues including FOV fixes.

2021: The light and sound are good. Particles, smoke and bullet holes are also kind of cool considering the age. But anything else is mediocre. 
Now, that famous AI is simply not impressive anymore and even on high difficulty it often acts stupid: performs useless (but ""cool-looking"") jumps from ladders, throws grenades into walls, and gets easily killed by a player who simply sits behind a corner holding Q, E or Ctrl and just shoots mindlessly. 

Pretty much all the ""mind-blowing"" features of the F.E.A.R. AI are present in the modern games, and with the AI being out of the equation, the game has nothing else to offer. Horror episodes are plain boring and not scary, levels are boring and huge, so you will spend a lot of time running along empty halls and storage rooms. The gunplay starts to get tedious after 2-3 hours of playing, because you realize that in general, everything will be the same of the rest of the game: enemies, shooting, guns, maps and the overuse of the bullet-time.

76561198297916230,1615445149,True,"""F.E.A.R."", otherwise known as ""F.E.A.R: First Encounter Assault Recon"", is a first-person shooter like few others. Developed by Monolith Productions (the makers of ""Shogo: Mobile Armour Division"", among other things) in 2005, the game has you step into the shoes of The Pointman- a U.S. Special Forces officer, and a new member of a specialised branch of the U.S. military, the eponymous F.E.A.R. organisation. 

First off, here's what the game does extraordinarily well:

- Graphics, effects, and sound design: F.E.A.R's level design is nothing to write home about (consisting primarily of offices and industrial facilities), but the graphics stand out for a 2005 title. The textures are a bit dated now, but in 2005, they were top-of-the-line. There's not a lot of colour though, but that's fine, considering that the effects are amazing. Blood splatters are really well done, bullets rip huge chunks out of walls, and explosions look great. When you enter bullet-time, bullets leave rippling contrails in the air, and debris hang in the air. The electricity effects are probably the worst of the bunch, but even they look passable. The best bit, though, is the lighting, most of which is dynamic. The lighting is what makes the otherwise boring levels stand out, at least in my opinion. Sound design is also quality, with great mixing, and a tense, but forgettable soundtrack. 

- Combat: You will have an arsenal of weapons to choose from by the end of the game, although you can only carry three at a time. There's the basics like 9mm pistols (which can be dual wielded for extra dakka), a sub-machine gun, and an assault rifle. Then there's the shotgun, which is the best weapon in the game, and is one of the best shotties in video game history. In addition, there's a particle lance, a revolving cannon, and a bunch of other cool toys. You can also melee enemies to death, and the melee animations take into account whether you're crouching, jumping, sprinting, standing still, or any combination of the above. 

- Bullet time & the John Woo inspiration: The combat and effects are made even better by the addition of a Matrix-style bullet time mode, and clear inspiration from John Woo's action movies. In slow-mo, your abnormally fast reflexes give you the perception of slowed time, in which you can dodge bullets, take enemies by surprise, and do really awesome shit. While this is going on, there will be smoke being thrown into the air, papers flying everywhere, and gore spurting in arcs through the air. It's frakking incredible. 

- Horror: compared to the...other games...in the series, FEAR is by far the most tense and the scariest. Taking inspiration from Japanese horror movies like The Ring, FEAR has some truely tense and frightening sections. Unfortunately, there are others where the developers went too far, and the game will sometimes amuse you rather than scare you. 

The bad (little that there is):

- Poor menu and UI layout that doesn't scale well to widescreen. 

- Tiny captions and font that's hard to read, even on larger screens. 

- Lots of loading screens between segments

- The characters and story are pretty bland overall, but are workable.

76561198118276894,1615411679,True,"This game is basically what would happen if you mixed Max Payne with Half-Life, sprinkled with early 2000's Japanese horror. If that doesn't sound amazing to you, then go play Animal Crossing or something.

Do you like absolutely demolishing a room with bullets, seeing glass and blood and sparks and drywall fly by in slow motion as you mow through telepathic clone troopers? Do you like nailing people to walls with railroad spikes, or pasting them into red mist with shotgun blasts, or just liquefying them into charred skeletons with particle beams? Do you want to see enemies with impressive AI shit themselves in fear and desperately coordinate with each other as you tear through entire squads at a time?

This game is amazing, and every FPS developer should look to it as an example. The fact that steam forced it into a fifty dollar bundle is terrible because no other game in the series, besides Extraction Point, comes close to the sheer FUN this game offers.

10/10, highly recommended."

The game is very good both story and gameplay wise.
Even though I normally don't play horror games, I still enjoyed playing F.E.A.R.
The atmosphere, the music is all scary and there aren't too much jumpscares ( I like :) ) and that makes it so good. You will not always expect it and that makes you so paranoid and you will always be on the edge of your chair. 
TL;DR: I don't play horror games yet I played (and finished) this one (and I enjoyed playing it), which says a lot."

76561198093726292,1614938339,True,"This game is fun as hell but there is a wrong way to play it which is like you would a normal FPS game since this game has this awesome slomo mechanic that jump opens up a whole new way of playing shooter games and is something that I completely missed on my first play through of this game and going back and using it made it so much more enjoyable. You dodge bullets and shoot the enemies who had pretty advanced AI for the time who can flank you and they feel like real soldiers who yell FUCK whenever you hit a good shot on them. The story is also very interesting with you hunting down this crazy guy who has control of a mindless army and they just shoot up this office building your stuck in for most of the game. The game has three main locations which are the water treatment plant, office, and Lab but they all look pretty samey which can make the game a bit of a slog but that's one of my only issues with the game and also how the levels are designed to make you take the longest route possible and then show you where you started with a much easier route to get to where you are now. This game is pretty old now but it has not aged that badly in the shooty shooty bang bang parts of the game but this game is only for sale in this stupid overpriced bundle like what is up with that?"
76561198091042133,1614916381,True,"F.E.A.R isn't without it's faults, having levels that can sometimes blend together, lacking in enemy variety and an incredibly dissapointing ending (at least in the main game, after which you should immediately jump into Extraction Point anyways), but despite those, it's got a very solid aesthetic of corporate/urban decay, what enemies there are have tons of character and an incredibly well implemented AI, the guns are incredible and it's an all around ball of fun to play, and to my mind the most solid singleplayer tactical FPS experience you can have.

EDIT: How could I forget the awesome soundtrack?
EDIT2: While I don't think it's all that noxious, it might be worth including a flashing/rapidly flickering lights warning for folks with photosensitivity issues.

Sadly Steam won't let you buy it separate from the dreadful Perseus Mandate and sequels so if you can, get it from a Humble Bundle deal [spoiler]or just buy the Platinum Edition on GoG[/spoiler], but even then paying USD$10 (or whatever it is in your currency when it goes on sale) for this and Extraction Point is more than worth it."
76561198013025154,1614894198,True,"The title F.E.A.R. stands for First Encounter Assault Recon, which, in the game, is a militaristic force the government set up to deal with paranormal encounters around America.

F.E.A.R. is at this point an absolute PC classic. If you enjoy FPS at all, you owe it to yourself to play this. The game undoubtedly shows its age; specially in some of the visuals like some of the models and textures. Despite this, the game absolutely passes the test of time; although the textures and models might be old, the lightning and some of the effects are still quite unique, and its gameplay is still impressive even to this day.


The game might be called F.E.A.R, but don't be fooled, although horror does play a relatively big part in the game, its main focus is action and combat. Getting into a firefight in FEAR feels like being in an old action movie, where theres smoke and particle effects everywhere. Enemies don't just drop dead in FEAR, they blow up, get bloodied, and even lose body parts. Shooting someone in FEAR is extremely satisfying; they'll get blasted back and attempt to get up if you shoot them with the shotgun, or start flailing around like a lunatic as you riddle them with bullets with the smg or one of the rifles. Add the ability to turn on slow motion at will (albeit with a meter that decreases as you stay in slow mo and regenerates as you stay out of it) and you're pretty much playing an older action movie... Which is what FEAR primarily tries to be.

Fear has level design that goes hand in hand with its gameplay and AI; It teaches you a lesson very early, and that is that enemies are never alone in this game. This is a good thing, because the level design is made for encounters with several enemies. It's hard to explain, for its time, the AI was definitely impressive... but it's only impressive because the level design compliments it so well. Enemies will wait for you to be vulnerable, or they'll try to flank you when you're not looking. They'll call out your location to other enemies and will use actual tactics to try to take you down. It's really impressive, but it's only because the level design allows it. The level design is great because the AI is, but the AI is great because the level design allows it to be. There's a lot of cramped spaces or corridors, back when it came out that didn't mean much but it's a lot more obvious nowadays that they tried to 'help out' the AI by making smaller or simpler sections where the AI wouldn't have much trouble figuring out what's going on. This isn't a bad thing of course - Good game design shines wether there's technical limitations or not, and FEAR is really, really well designed.


This all being said, FEAR is still a horror game - even if it emphasizes action first. So is the horror good? Well... Sometimes. I'm not someone that gets scared easily by any form of media, but even some of the later atmosphere and creepy moments got me, near the end. There's some good atmosphere and absolutely absurd creepy moments in this game... but there's also a lot of silly ones. For example, one of the first scares in the game is a skeleton coming out of a blood pool while you walk really slowly towards a room. That's not scary, maybe back when it was released it could've been but definitely not now.

That being said the horror and action are both closely tied thanks to the story, which I found to be mildly interesting, even if a bit convoluted to piece together. You get the full picture through stuff like emails you find on computers, or phone calls left around... But a lot of them are really easy to miss, or they're in a weird timeframe. You'll probably end up playing the game 2 or 3 times if you want to put all the pieces together, although the story isn't bad, how it's presented is... not very good to say the least.

So should you get this game? No, because you should get the complete FEAR pack instead. You can't buy FEAR 1, its expansion or FEAR 2's dlc separately anymore. This game alone justifies the price for the entire pack, and although some people don't like FEAR 3, FEAR 2 is widely recognized as a good game, if not as good as the first one, and Extraction Point is pretty much ""fear 1 but better"""

76561197971018001,1614659711,True,"An absolute classic. The horror parts are great and the shooting parts are challenging and fun. While the graphics are dated, they're still pretty good and any shader effect (blurs, distortions, etc) have held up extremely well. The story is pretty engaging, especially if you have some tolerance for cheese. All the weapons are cool and fun to use. And there's some pretty awesome setpieces in there!

Here's the bad: the level design is extremely dated. Lots and lots of pointless corridors going into rooms that don't serve any purpose (except that there's bad guys in there and you need to kill them). Control scheme is dated as well. You'll have to do a lot of fiddling to get it up to modern standards and even then it's still awkward. Audio is okay but seems to have some directional issues and feels flat in places; I think because the game is expecting a dedicated audio card (which used to be common but modern onboard audio is powerful enough for average consumer use). It's also annoying that, storywise, [spoiler] your character doesn't actually end up doing anything. You don't prevent the deaths of anybody, you don't prevent the main baddy from being released, and you don't meaningfully stop her. You -- the player and the character -- are both just along for the ride. [/spoiler]

The biggest issue, though, is that the horror and the action clash. A lot. If you can't deal with going from pulse-pounding action to outright horror, then this is not the game (or franchise!) for you. I sort of like the dissonance between horror and action (which is why I love the franchise) but I know it can be real off-putting for some people.

But if you're okay with that dissonance and you can overlook or deal with some of the dated features, this game is still a lot of fun and well-worth your time!

Buy it if the price is $20 or lower, or get it in a bundle with F.E.A.R. 2"

The ai is intelligent, with Replicas using tactics to ensure the Point Man is terminated. Overall, this game was innovative, with an amazing slow motion feature.

While F.E.A.R. claims to be a horror game, it's just not scary at all. In fact, the horror aspects get annoying quickly. If F.E.A.R. focused more on being a game where you are constantly in combat, kind of like Doom Eternal, then this would be a much better game.

76561198183665477,1612910643,True,"This is a kinda mixed review because I do love this game. As someone who played it when it first came out, this game is an old masterpiece. Playing it now is very difficult because it is just so old and the different systems like healing and grenades are outdated. As of right now, I have not finished it nor do I plan too. It is much more of a shooter than a horror game and, because it is so old, the horror aspect is either outdated or never really seen. I don't know why this game has yet to be remastered because the multiplayer was fun when it came out and the single-player was fun when it was out. I also believe that the lack of jumpscares and different environments cause the game to get really repetitive. 
Health - You lose health very quickly and get too many health packs when you do not need them. 
Outdated - Not the graphics, but the gameplay. As I said, it gets repetitive and stale due to the lack of different scenarios. The graphics does affect the jumpscares, but I personally believe the jumpscares are really basic.
Gunfights - You shoot 5 to 7 enemies and move to a new area where you look around for health and then shoot 5 to 7 enemies and move to a new area where you look for an exit and health and shoot 5 to 7 enemies plus a big guy and move to a new area where you look for health, ammo, and an exit. Could you guess what happens next? You shoot 5 to 7 enemies again!
I am not hating on the game. I just think the developers need a second chance to fix bugs, make the game look even better, make the gameplay more fun, make it scarier, and, instead of having slow motion tell the player there is a jump scare happening or something spooky occurs, make the jump scares catch the player's eye. A good jump scare doesn't need slow motion. 
If I had to rate the game, I would put it at a 7.5/10.
A remaster would fix most of these issues.

76561198160768079,1612365167,True,"FEAR is one of the best single player first person shooters you can play. It's polished to perfection, the guns feel weighty and responsive, the sound design is top notch and the graphics are great for the time, due to some pretty good art direction. The horror aspect is cool, there are some pretty inventive jumpscares and it paces the game pretty well , acting as a break between gunfights. And what gunfights these are. Your weapons make concrete break and fill rooms with dust, sparks fly everywhere, glass breaks and paperwork flies all around the place as you shoot up corporate offices and  basements, and the slow mo makes it all the more cinematic. Enemies get blasted in half and pinned to walls, and your shotgun sometimes turns them into a red mist. All these elements add to one of the best feeling games I've played, and to top it off, the clone soldiers themselves react so naturally to situations, it can get downright impressive. They'll throw grenades to get you out of your cover, try to flank you, flinch and duck when you shoot at them unexpectedly, and i've even seen one of em go prone and slither under some pipes to escape from the disadvantageous position i'd just put him in. Fears AI has always received praise, but playing this now, i wasn't expecting it to be this good. FEAR is a classic game, for me it's up there with the original DOOM games and Half Life, it sits right between those games and the modern shooters that were to come. If you like shooting virtual guys in your PC, or just like action games in the slightest, this game is for you."
76561198279651638,1612314007,True,Classic horror shooter that works very nicely with my PS4 controller despite not being designed for it. I love the atmosphere of the game. Much better than the types of game released today
76561198120376740,1612311896,True,"First time ever playing this, knew nothing about the story or gameplay so went in blind and sufficed to say was a really fun game, graphics were really good considering it was made in 2005, story was really interesting however may take 2 playthroughs to fully understand. 

The shooting and slowing down time on this game is very oddly satisfying and makes you feel like John Wick who's just sniffed a line of Cocaine.

Overall a very good game and one I'll most likely come back too in the future."

9/10

[h1] Intro [/h1]
You want a first-person Max Payne? F.E.A.R. is for you. It's also a classic example of low poly monsters being ironically more scary than realistic looking ones, because your imagination has to fill in the blanks and what not. Also, it's just a really good shooter with top notch feedback.

[h1] Positives [/h1]
+ Dismemberment.
+ Good soundtrack.
+ Great replay value.
+ Good enemy variety.
+ Great weapon variety.
+ Weapons have great impact.
+ Good aesthetics and graphics.
+ Includes the Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate expansions.

[h1] Negatives [/h1]
- Environment variety is low.

76561197990907535,1611791710,True,Played it quite a bit on ps3 as it was my first ps3 title. Game stands the test of time and the expansions are great additions as well.

76561198035277356,1611539940,True,"Great game, really fun gameplay. No matter what dumb stuff the story may throw at you, the slow-mo gunfights are 10/10.

The sound of your boots squelching on blood-soaked carpet haunts my dreams."
76561198003980571,1611515402,True,"Hard to believe this game is 16 years old, and it still scary AF. Good action, good gun play with slow-mo feature. All round good Action/Horror game."
76561199108431090,1611504453,True,this game is pretty swag.
76561198976667284,1611462759,False,"I think this game is alright, my only real complaint is that I had to quit the game several times because the screen would get all buggy by dropping the FPS in a strange way, other than that its a good game that I would probably replay after a LONG time because the buggy screen dies down the replay ability

to explain the screen bug and FPS drop, I will play the game for about ten minutes with great frame rates, then it will seem out of nowhere the screen will act up, then the frame rate will just drop and it slows the game down horribly, I don't know why a game that came out so long ago would run so badly on a computer that is still very new, hell Quake 1,2, and 4 run 10x better than this game and I never get FPS problems with those games"
76561198054385574,1611460430,True,"TL;DR: Perhaps the only game that does bullet time perfectly. Awesome combat feel and pace. Plus my second favorite shotgun in all of gaming. These guys made BLOOD and this game has tons of it.

People praise the AI in this game because it is based on the settings the AI is put into rather than given just general directions, so enemy call outs and movement are a lot more realistic. Fantastic job all around."

"
76561198274566116,1611445633,True,its fun
76561198026553208,1611440175,True,"This game is very good, though you have to search the internet for an fps boost.

This has an interesting story and mechanics, you can kick em, slide em, whap em, shoot em (choose a good weapon if you can or you will possibly shoot enemies like you missed them somehow), and that can assure that you can most likely attack from any angle, assisted by the slo-mo. Sometimes you might get lost and try to walk places, then go somewhere that almost seemed impossible to go to after a long walk or etcetera. But everything else seems nice.

I am gonna go to my weird design critiquing side:

This is a ""true first-person"" shooter, meaning that you have a body, and are doing things from eye perspective in the shooter genre, and I personally LOVE these sorts of things because of the things that go into the player's animations to make it seem first person and also seem relevant to other perspectives in game, what you are sticking out around the corner, what you are fiddling with, what skeletal position you might be in, anyone can see.

The lighting is sometimes well done for environments, other times it's just good in general.

And the parallax mapping, I can't find any other game that uses this earlier! It's well done as well!

An 8/10. I got this standalone somehow, fuck you Warner Bros. for making everyone else get all of them for more profit, but thank you Monolith for making this game."
76561198117799303,1611417013,True,Love this game since the 360 days i kinda want it to be in VR that would be sweet
76561198969545186,1611405497,True,"This game is still fantastic 13 years later. It's aged in a number of ways, but the baseline gameplay action of pumping a shotgun round into an enemy's chest in slow-motion, while particle and bloodspatter effects go wild, is just as exhilarating today as it was when this game came out. I don't think you can buy it separately any more on Steam, but F.E.A.R. 1 and F.E.A.R 2 are both great anyway in my opinion, so even if you have to pay a bit extra to get the superfluous  third installment, I can still easily recommend getting the pack.

A caveat: you will most likely need to download a small mod to fix problems with the framerate that occur when you use a keyboard and mouse in this game. I thought maybe this game could not run any more on Windows 10, because I was getting 10 fps unless I unplugged these devices. But a simple 100kb file added to the game's folder will fix all that. And you want this game to have the highest fps your pc can muster. 

F.E.A.R. is a great shooter. The movement, the feel of the guns, and the slow-motion are all on point, and shooting a dude just feels more satisfying than it does in 90 percent of shooters out there. This game took me about 9 hours to finish on the second-highest difficulty, and it was fun all the way through. Normally I am someone who enjoys a relaxed experience and would never say that people ""should play a game on a high difficulty"" or whatever, but in this game, playing on the second-to-highest or highest difficulty feels pretty good. I barely died, to be honest, because the slow-motion ability gives you an enormous advantage against the enemies, but it was never so easy as to be unsatisfying. Furthermore, playing on higher difficulties makes you very sensitive to the enemy's fire as well, so if you don't take cover and use the slow-motion ability well, the enemies can still feel dangerous. 

The level design is also very well done, and is (according to the developers) the reason the AI of the enemies feels so good, even to this day. The enemy behavior apparently amounts to a bunch of clever tricks used by the developers, but the end result still speaks for itself anno 2021. The enemies will try to flank you, work together, call out where you are, flush you out, and communicate their own numbers and fears as those numbers dwindle fast. In almost each encounter, you have multiple options to approach and flank them, and have to be on the look-out for enemies doing the same thing to you. The low enemy and weapon variety is therefore made up for easily by the baseline level of fun that you get from fighting these guys. It did not get old at all in these 9 hours.

There are some gripes. It may be because I am now about 13 years older than I was when I first played this on XBOX 360, but the game was basically never scary or hardly even tense most of the time. I remember being very startled by some of the jumpscares and horror movie scenes back then, but now they barely did anything to me. I think that is in large part because the higher resolution sort of reveals too much of these scenes. You're supposed to be unnerved by shadowy figures standing at the edge of your vision, watching you, but in this playthrough, I just went: ""Huh, there's a guy standing at the top of those stairs, watching me. And now he's blinked out of existence. Okay."" It makes me wonder how well the Condemned games hold up, because those were really atmospheric to me ten years ago, but maybe suffer from the same thing. 

The environments are sparse and industrial by design. It fits with the theme of the game and story, but clearly it also is simply a sacrifice made to allow for the awesome particle effects of the combat to take center stage. And for the most part it is totally worth it, so I can't blame Monolith for the choice. Still, some of the ""environmental storytelling"" could have been a bit better. The characters really only get faces put on them by the end of the game, so for the first 5 to 6 hours I was listening to all these voice messages between characters that I had never even encountered, alluding to events in the story that you are meant to piece together. But I hardly knew who was who among the various senior staff of this company building I was in. Your F.E.A.R. soldier squad buddies are all also extremely aloof about the situation, considering the absolutely wild stuff that is happening, and the horrible ways in which people die. I guess it's supposed to convey they are trained badasses or something, but many of the characters you eventually meet seem extremely stupid. Then again, no horror movie would happen if the characters in them were smart, I suppose. 

So to summarize: highly recommend this game for 8 - 10 hours of fantastic gunplay fun. The rest of it doesn't quite hold up as well 13 years later, but that does not detract much from the experience."

One of the best shooters I have ever played."
76561198161380344,1611378080,True,"Definitely a lot of fun to play, but it doesn't have as much of a horror aspect to it as I expected. Don't get me wrong, there are a few good scares to be had, but it's more of a fun game to mess around in while killing enemies. Highly recommend if you're looking for a good time."

76561198840839941,1610601724,True,this is game is incredible but I wish you didnt have to be forced to buy the fear pack.

I enjoyed going back to experience this on PC. The A.I. in this game is really good, better than in most FPS games so it can be a bit challenging first time through. Overall though it's definitely still worth playing."
76561197960440071,1610491955,True,"F.E.A.R.'s story is overrated, its environments are repetitive, and its scares have aged like milk. None of that brings down the combat and AI, which was and remains some of the best in first-person shooter history. Very few shooters have pulled off the slow-motion Hollywood firefight spectacle as well as F.E.A.R did, and fewer still have enemy AI that is as convincingly human-like as this game. May require fixes to run on modern systems."
76561198101229387,1610470639,True,Haven't had this much fun with an FPS in a long time.
76561197960454981,1610415441,True,"Great game with great mechanics, which is good today as it was when it was released"
76561198162219748,1610405901,False,"F.E.A.R's gameplay consists of either slowly walking through dark, empty hallways or fighting stupid AI. Combat is painfully easy, even on the hardest difficulty. Every fight consists entirely of poking your head out from behind cover and picking off a handful of clones one by one. As for the story, it wasn't particularly engaging and what I assume were meant to be ""horror"" elements were mostly just annoying. 
Surely it was a masterpiece in it's heyday, but in 2021, it doesn't have much value beyond nostalgia."
76561198268575047,1610328319,True,"F.E.A.R. is a pretty darn great and unique, narrative-driven fps that blends horror, atmosphere, and action perfectly. As the saying goes, it's aged like a fine wine; and the DLCs that come with it are worth playing too. The story doesn't make much sense, but that didn't really bother me. I do have a few warnings though.

Before purchasing, you should be aware that in some respects the difficulty is really easy (ammo and health are plentiful) and in others it's extremely difficult (enemies tear through your health bar in almost the blink of an eye). It's just the nature of balancing around slo-mo. It took me by surprise a bit, so just be prepared.
 
The second thing you should be warned about is that it doesn't work perfectly on modern systems. There's a bug that causes the framerate to tank when Logitech devices, like my mouse, are plugged in. Also, the expansions don't support widescreen initially. There are very simple guides to fix both of these issues though, so I'm not holding it against the game.

It's strange that you can't just buy the game alone on Steam, so I recommend picking it up from a different storefront, like Humble or GOG. Or, if you want to buy the whole series, wait for a sale because $55 is pretty high for such old games--even one that holds up so well, and especially since the sequels are supposed to be... less good."
76561198961458918,1610319295,True,"Best horror FPS to this day overall.

The Expansions are pretty trash since it wasn't monolith doing them and they have a disconnected from server error that pretty much sums up the experience as awful.
Unfortunately there isn't a way of not recommending these Expansions.

The base game 10/10 and that's all you should play trust me."
76561198018973276,1610283632,True,"Has the right mixture of ai, weapon feel, and effects. Still looks decent despite coming out in 2005. Needs patch to have good performance on modern systems."
76561198056538993,1610239425,True,The highlight of this game is the lighting and combat. When you enter a room vs when you leave it is very drastic considering bullets leave giant holes in the walls and floor and alot of the objects can be moved around. Horror and story wise its still pretty good even if there are a few pointless scares (I enter a room and a ghost knocks a few paintcains over oooooooo scary.)
76561198121085155,1610238432,True,"If you like DOOM 3 & shooting in slow motion like your Max Payne, than F.E.A.R. is the game for you."
76561198989051349,1610220419,True,"F.E.A.R has some of the most intensive and thrilling gunfights ever with the best AI I have ever seen in a game that acts with self-preservation. This game also still looks great with some very impressive lighting and models. It also has great weapon variety and I really only have two big issues. One being that the location variety is rather lacking and the environments are pretty generic even if there are still designed very well for combat. Two being the mediocre horror aspect and story of this game which is just plain bad and feels so out of place in a power fantasy fps like this. Overall, F.E.A.R. is a really solid fps and I plan on beating it's two expansions and the rest of the trilogy."
76561198046896342,1610218555,True,"The chatterbox dialogue of two enemies:

-Any movement ?
-Shut the f up !!!"
76561198123086145,1610205610,True,"for a 2005 release, this FPS title holds really well
the gameplay and shooting mechanic is great and impactful with it's particle effects, sound design, and bump mapped bullet hole textures. The lighting and texture looks fantastic even by today's standards. The story is entertaining at best and mediocre at worst, but it flows smoothly from one moment to another. The only aspect of this game that didn't age well was it's scare factor, they're mostly cheesy and uninteresting but a few actually got me and it's not the biggest aspect of the game (that goes to the combat) so no biggie

I was so young I couldn't remember the game at all when I played through it again other than the name. For an old game it was a blast to play through, he story throughout these games is great even though it's quite confusing. I always felt on edge and the introduction between (new) weapons, enemies, and levels were probably my favorite part. I loved the gameplay and the level design too. It may be short in a way but still worthwhile and leaving me wanting more. You always feel like your not safe and always on edge peaking around every corner but when you do feel safe, it's with another character, (SPOILER) of course... until they leave you for dead, or send you out on a mission or get obliterated out of existance in horrific ways. Which I LOVE the way they did these events. You feel great after seeing an ally or two but then at times some mysterious things happen and when it does happen everything feels... uneasy and tense, you become terrified by what killed them and left with a blink of an eye also without seeing your new enemy. Scared you quickly run back to find some cover with only one way in and one way out, and as you hide behind cover hoping that it's gone, you suddenly hear movements in a vent of somekind. You quickly turn around and see it in all of its glory leaping out at you from the vent behind the counter you hid behind without noticing it. Suddenly everything seems to go in slow motion and you quickly ready your gun and blast it into a million pieces. What was that? You wonder. Only to realize that two more appeared from the doorway that you were hiding from and from there my review ends."

It absolutely shows its age sometimes, whether that be from the occasional bug or texture hiccup, but those in comparison to everything else wonderful about this game are miniscule.

Don't start with the sequels just because they're prettier visually. Start with this one because you get the raw experience of what made F.E.A.R. great in the first place.

76561198031777504,1609692098,True,"I can say without a doubt that this is one of the best horror action games I have played in a very long time. The gun play is tight and enjoyable with a decent selection of weapons to choose, from akimbo pistols to a particle gun that oneshots most enemies. The horror isn't in your face either, there is a lot more atmosphere horror and subtle ways the game makes you feel uncomfortable. There are a couple of jumpscares, but they are few and far between and you are always aware of them from your radio receiving a static transmission (a la Silent Hill 2). Overall I would highly recommend picking this game and up playing it with only 3 caveats:
1. You will need to look through the discussion forums to find a .dll file that you need to put in the game folder to stop it from lagging to nothing
2. The game appears to have a memory leak that will cause you to get ""Disconnected from server"" when you are playing single player, the fix for this can also be found in the discussion forums
3. Its bullshit that you can only buy this game as a set with 2 and 3.

Because they don't have separate store pages here is my quick review for Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate:
Extraction Point is good and a perfect expansion to F.E.A.R. however it suffers from the above mentioned issues and even worse. I couldn't get past the subway because my save file refused to load correctly.
Perseus Mandate is mediocre at best and not really worth your time, if you really want to play some of it, but its not like it cost you anything anyways."

76561198053032432,1609656911,False,"[h1]More than just outdated, it's painfully [u]boring[/u] [/h1]
I have some choice words for this game, and if it's the best one in the series, this franchise as a whole is a drawn-out joke that took too long to finish. No wonder Warner Bros. is letting it rot. 

The selling points of this game according to its fans and or marketing come down to three things: 
[olist]
    [*]The mingling of the lighting with the textures
    [*]The horror elements
    [*]The intelligent AI along with the shooting gameplay,notably the most beloved.
[/olist]

Exactly 0 of these points end up being interesting/fun, but rather novelty. It's not enough to call this game obviously aged and from 2005; the game forces you at every opportunity it has to ""experience"" its technology meant to compete on the level of other games at the time. Doom 3, Half-Life 2, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, and other games from the early-mid 2000s tried really hard to be technically impressive. How well this works out varies per game, but for F.E.A.R, it pushes its aspects every other minute which quickly dissipates how exciting they are, as exciting as 2005 technology can be 16 years later. Hard light is everywhere and while in itself feels natural, the level design is too excited to show it whenever possible. Lights produce jagged, completely black shadows too often and look wrong. I am fond that the player's shadow is dynamic and works with the lighting, but the lighting itself always feels plastered to distract from the unimpressive environments. The textures themselves are okay and look good for 2005, but do not make up for the cheap design tricks at every corner. It feels very phony and forced

The story is embarrassing and not engaging one bit. It's not a good kind of campy; it's the kind that makes you roll your eyes to the back of your head. From start to finish, the game is cheesy and tries to take itself half-seriously, making its cliche story even more of a slog to bother with. The plot twist of the Point Man being part of the same overdone ""experiment gone wrong"" trope does not strike the player with any sense of shock or interest, as well as its other tired moments. No revelation keeps me awake, and none of the horror is any good. The ending of the game, a cliffhanger with a jumpscare followed by credits, is blatantly rushed and unsatisfying, making a stance for the game's direction as a whole. Word-of-mouth is that the horror element is a secondary interest at best, but that does not stop it from being relevant in both the game's marketing and set pieces. It's most definitely there, and none of it is scary at all. There is no sense of buildup at any point of the game despite how dark it can get; none of it gets oppressive or makes you feel dread to enter another room. ""Iconic"" antagonist Alma is obviously influenced by The Ring's Samara but holds none of the latter's suspense or visual menace to back up being anything other than a cheap visual gag. The overuse of flames in a dark room or a laboratory hall in nightmare sequences never changes or spices up whatever lack of tension is supposed to occur in them. Finally, the poorest offender of the terrible horror is its forgettable sound. All fantastic horror games make special use of sound design from uneasy ambiance, to dead silent set pieces, to rampant music that pressures the player. Effective sound design does not exist in this game's horror, making it all feel simply shoed-in and exhausting to bother proceeding with. 

Ignorant fans and players in general are quick to dismiss story in games, especially if the gameplay itself is spectacular enough to hold your attention. Giving F.E.A.R the benefit of the doubt, say we can ignore the story or even the horror; all that is left is its reputable lighting tricks, already labeled unimpressive, and the gunplay. Unfortunately, what praise I can give to it is that it is ""serviceable"" at best. The gimmick of the game is its use of on-demand slow motion, available to be activated at your pleasure at any given moment. Initially, it is a fun spectacle. Activating the reflex meter has the world slowly pace so that you can aim your shots carefully, see ragdolls fly or explode, or quickly escape. Amusing at first, but quickly it loses charm. Many of the weapons you use in the game either lack substantial ammunition, become ineffective against later enemies, or are not satisfying to use. Why are the SMGs and most common assault rifles in forced burst fire? It feels jarring in a game that lets you emphasize precision, adding to an unsatisfying experience. Not all weapons are bad: the pistols and particularly the 10mm feel nice and fair in their abilities to make precise shots and eliminate enemies. The shotgun has a reputation, but I find that it only lives up to it on weak enemies such as grunts or ATC. Otherwise, its slow rate of fire and thus slow time to kill betrays its image as an overpowered killing machine. The overall mundane gunplay combined with the gimmicky slow-mo makes shooting become boring and more of a chore needed to proceed. There are other trivial elements such as being able to shoot your grenades mid-air, commit some takedowns, and shoot incoming projectiles, but these abilities are both redundant and ineffective. It's difficult to encourage these minor traits when you have to force them to happen, all the while simply shooting is much more effective and easier. Enemy AI lets you know that the game further attempts to be technologically impressive, and while it mostly works in the game's favor for how it plays out, it is most definitely overly hyped. Enemies flank, throw grenades, take notice of where you are, and cooperate, yet it feels half-baked because the environments themselves are claustrophobically linear and don't give AI room to flourish as much as they deserve. It is too easy to peak corners or bait with a flashlight + followed by trip mine and makes NPCs look like chump change. 

All together: the story is cringy, the horror is terrible, the environments are outrageously dated, and the acclaimed gunplay turns out to be average at best. The formula of the entire game is walk point A to point B, kill a squad of clones, experience an unscary scripted event, and repeat. It is dull and not worth sitting through for more than 2 hours, let alone 10

76561197995167139,1609534956,True,"So, I went back and played these games again in hopes of being able to leave a more wholesome review, and also just because these games are so much fun. These reviews will be spoiler free for anyone who hasn't played these games. I will be reviewing each individual F.E.A.R game in order of game release. 

F.E.A.R is a first person shooter horror game that was released on PC in October 2005, and for a game that was released almost 25 years ago, I believe it can stand on equal ground or exceed in areas of modern first person shooter games. Of the three F.E.A.R games, the original is the best, being the longest and the greatest blend of elements within the game. 

In the game, you play as a nameless protagonist (who is known as Point Man) who has recently joined the organization First Encounter Assault Recon (FEAR). Your character has reflexes that are ""totally off the charts"" according to one of the game's characters (we will get more to this feature here soon). The moment you start the first mission, the creepy atmosphere takes off revealing that this game is more than just a shooter (hence the name FEAR). The game is well none for its creepy, unnerving and at times downright scary moments. Some elements will catch you by surprise, and others will be obvious, but you can't ""nope"" your way out of it. Your badass arsenal that you can collect in the game will be of little help against ghost girls and other things that go bump in the night. 

But don't worry, the carnage and downright epic gun fights in the game will take center stage as you will battle against very formidable foes that used (for the time, and I would argue still to this day) advanced AI that plans and reacts very quickly and strategically against you. They will utilize cover fire, flanking tactics, hunkering, and even retreating and withdrawing to regroup and take you out. Be very aware of your surroundings when fighting these guys. But, you will have a clear advantage in your SLOWMO effects. 

In terms of gameplay, F.E.A.R is very smooth, and damn near flawless (some weird ragdoll physics of dead enemies). The graphics, lightening, sound and music in the game all work so well to immerse you in a modern ring/grudge like horror game and then yank you into a John Wick firefight, blasting holes in walls, papers and body parts flying all over. And when the dust (literally) settles, you slowly go right back into that uneasy setting. 

As for story, this is the first chapter in the FEAR trilogy (FEAR 2 and FEAR 3) and the only one among this F.E.A.R that is recognized as canon. The story is well crafted, both in terms of world building and mystery. You get a sense that there is more to meet the eye as the game progresses. 

There is a multi-player element, though I do not know if it is still active anymore, but I know there are community made mods and services that still host FEAR. When it was active, FEAR Multi-player offered the same carnage that the single player was known for, but in well known game modes such as Free For All, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and then a Slow Motion Keep away game. 

The first F.E.A.R was, and still is a masterpiece, and a game that urge anyone new or old to gaming who hasn't played it to play it. 10/10. 

Now, the next game was F.E.A.R Extraction Point, and takes place immediately after the first game. You play as the same nameless ""Point Man"" in the aftermath of the events of the first game. The game play and mechanics are all the same, say for a few different enemies and two new weapons. I will say, that out of all three games in this bundle, Extraction Point is the scarier of the three, in my opinion. To this day, I still get unnerved by the levels and the situations I found myself in. 9/10

The last one is F.E.A.R Perseus Mandate, and it was my least favorite of the three games. In this expansion, you find yourself not as the first two games nameless ""Point Man"" but a nameless Sergeant that is with a second F.E.A.R team that had a mission during the events of the original F.E.A.R, which also blends into the time frame of Extraction Point. You somehow have the same slow motion powers that the Point Man has, but that is never explained, as this expansion tailors more to the combat that made F.E.A.R so popular. There is A LOT of fighting in this expansion, with less scares. This game did offer a new faction that you fight against, and some new weapons too. But my god, the maps and the story killed it for me. Most of the maps were featureless, way to open that didn't have the charm or attention to detail that F.E.A.R, or even F.E.A.R Extraction Point had. 6/10

All in all, F.E.A.R is a master piece of a game that must be played and enjoyed. If you are a fan of First Person Shooters, Horror games, or a new gamer, then get this computer."

76561198414350299,1609485077,False,"Really easy and really boring fps. 

1. the game showers you with medpacks so much so it made me wonder if I played on easy would I have drowned in them?

2. the enemy AI tries to outwit you but fails miserably every time often repeating the same tactic as their fallen comrades in exactly the same place and way

3. speaking of the enemy the poor bastards stood no chance with the lean mechanic which made me practically invulnerable to attack in corridors and tighter spaces.

4. open spaces with limited cover is where the enemy shined as they could effectively flank for once until i got a scoped burst weapon and picked em off from afar

5. the enemy notices the light verbally but unless they have line of site act like nothing happened.

6. the combat scenarios are spaced far apart often padded out with ""horror"" which mostly consists of dark spaces and random static here and there with Alma playing peakaboo every now and again.

7. the torch is utter trash so much so that i would have traded it for a candle lit lamp as it would have probably pierced the darkness further than 5 metres.

8. the guns have no iron sight but all have minor zoom so......why?

9.bullet time is good it activates when you choose it to but it basically eliminates any difficulty of enemies.

in summation the only time i died was when i ran around serious sam style with a shotgun avoiding cover and got swamped   by shotgun units. This game is more about atmosphere and in my opinion is basically a dull walking simulator with the occasional shooting range so you dont fall asleep."
76561198128496123,1609463541,True,"15 years later and still one of the few shooters I liked enough to play all the way through twice. Incredible combat due to tight controls and amazing graphics/music, weapons that pack a tremendous punch and wicked clever AI. The pace drags in the second act due to a lot of same-y corridor crawling and a limited variety of enemies (for reasons that make sense, but still), but the intensity rarely stops and the novel blend of action and J-horror still hasn't been equaled today (not even by Monolith itself).  If the F.E.A.R. series had started and ended here (and honestly I think it should have), it would be even more of a classic than it is now."

It is without a doubt the best first person shooter I have ever played.

Graphically the game is still great to look at 2k and the environment is a superb concrete jungle ripe for killing. 
The ambiance is fantastic and one of the things that gives a big dumb smile on my face is dynamic music and, oh baby, does the ost deliver what's needed.

Performance is weird to say the least, but a quick community link to a .dll file to drop in the main F.E.A.R. directory had it running buttery smooth.( same goes with the DLCs)

Tough enemies that feel really REALLY good to fight with some enemy types that blew my expectations. As for your means to murder said enemies comes some of the most satisfying weapons I've come across.
Trust me, clearing a whole room and seeing all the carnage you created when the dust settles and shell casings finally hit the floor is electrifying.

As for the story, it is really unique and very very dark. Some people say they don't play this game for it but I feel the horror twist really gives it a flavor I've not experienced before in a shooter (besides Dead Space and RE4). 

At the end I was left wanting more and it is a good thing too because you get all the DLC, Fear 2 and 3 (meh).
All in all, I love to come back every now in then and see how it holds up and every time I am pleased with just how much fun FEAR is."

F.E.A.R in short for First Encounter Assault Recon is a unique blend of first person shooting, sci-fi horror and lore tied together lovingly by the talented team at Monolith Productions. Being such a highly regarded game, I felt I should try checking out this game. And I was left wanting for more! This is definitely a game that you want to experience unspoiled. Aside from a very brief cutscenes that happen at the beginning of some of the levels, the story comes to you mainly through searching through the various buildings and offices for blinking lights on phones or laptop computers. While shooters have been around for at least three decades, very few of them have actually captured the essence of satisfying combat, sound design.   

FEAR stood out from other horror games. It launched during a time when almost every major game developer tried to model survival/horror games after Resident Evil being the most popular series in the genre. With the focus more on action and shooting mechanics combined with supernatural elements like bullet time this game gave me a feeling of power against shockingly intelligent enemy A.I.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+Legendary enemy A.I that will try to strategize attacks and pin-point your location. The replicas will co-ordinate with its team mates and surround you, try to flank you, take cover and defend the band and also surprise you in the most unexpected ways. 
+Memorable antagonists. 
+Each weapon feels a bit different from one another and they all feel very powerful and meaty.
+Excellent presentation and combat for a game that’s 15 years old!
+The developers didn’t rely on cheap jump scares like other classic horror games instead opted to add rich atmospheric visuals and sound. 
+Perfect game length (around 10-12 hours long).
+I’ve experienced a smooth gameplay without any bugs, crashes or unexpected runtime errors. Tested on Windows 10, 64-bit Os.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
-What I didn't liked is how the game felt hollow and empty. It was like head to the next room, torch up the scene into a bloodbath, then an empty stretch, Alma appearing, again kill replica soldiers and repeat. The levels designs are not that great and the environments felt too bland.
-Some environments were recycled a bit too much.
-Although the game offers great action set pieces there’s not much that’ll take your breath away, nothing you haven’t seen before in other classic horror movies.
-The story was confusing at best and the anti-climatic ending didn’t help anything either. 
-Most in-game dialogues takes place during gunfights and I barely got time to listen to the backstories. Not sure if you’d find any luck.
-You can no longer buy this game individually on Steam.
-Multiplayer is dead.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
Fear is a great one-time experience. The suspense during missions is very high and the sounds and animations keep the player on the edge of their seat. Monolith Productions really did a great job in putting together a quality game that will give you chills. It reminds me of those horror movies like The Shinning and Ring. It provides the right complement of action combined with well-placed paranormal events. 
Many of the enemies are quite unique and offer some serious challenge on the higher difficulty settings. Despite some challenging situations the game never feels punishing and make you count every bullet. You may feel outnumbered but you’ll never feel like you’re outgunned. The slow-motion feature does make the game a little easy, but you can choose avoid being relied on it. The ideal way to experience this game is to create a scare factor atmosphere by playing it at night with the lights turned off. 

[h1]My Rating: 8/10[/h1]

Not only that but, the shotgun in this game is easily one of the best in the genre. The satisfying punch and gibs that it delivers is astounding. The AI for the game is also something that definitely gives it an upper hand in terms of age. To this day you would be hard pressed to find AI that works this well.

76561198175998445,1608088862,True,"(Edited since I beat Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate now)

[b] F.E.A.R 1: [/b] Easily one of the top five greatest FPS games of all time, and a serious contender for top 15 greatest video games, period. This game is [i] sixteen years old [/i] but is better than pretty much any FPS you could care to name that has come out in the past decade or so. The gunplay is phenomenal; shooting feels good, difficulty is [i] pitch [/i]-perfect, and the slow-mo is something that more games should do (assuming they can implement it as well). The graphics actually hold up pretty damn well considering their age; I never had any issues with them. 
The atmosphere is top-notch. There's a sense of pervasive dread that is only broken up by the firefights you find yourself in. I could write a fucking essay on the sound design in this game, but I'll let you experience it yourself. 
I see people complain about how the story makes no sense or just isn't good or how you aren't told enough about it. If those people actually [i] listened [/i] and paid any sort of attention while playing, they'd understand the story. Maybe not perfectly, since it is very esoterically-told, but they'd get it. 

[b] Extraction Point: [/b] Basically what I said about 1, but EP is...actually scarier than 1, by quite a bit. Even though it's non-canon, I think its ending is a way better ending to the series than whatever the fuck happens in F.E.A.R 3. I put EP a small step below 1 for reasons I can't explain so much as feel. 

[b] Perseus Mandate: [/b] Not bad. The atmosphere isn't quite there, the [i] feeling [/i] that 1 and EP have isn't quite there, and the gameplay - in terms of enemy encounters and placement - isn't quite there, but it's still really good and you should still play it. Also non-canon. 

Long story short? F.E.A.R is essentially undiluted perfection molded into a video game. I cannot think of a single thing I'd change about it.

I've played FEAR 3 (looks nice and performs well!) a few times and intend on playing it quite a bit more but can't get FEAR 1 to perform well on a 2020-age computer. Firstly, a 16:9 aspect ratio is shown to be non-optimized. Secondly, the game runs for about a minute at 220 FPS then drops to a maximum of 10! When I go look in the settings, it's automatically dropped down to a lower resolution and won't regain more than 10 FPS until I relaunch the game, then one minute later of game play, back to 10, which is pretty much unplayable.

I usually like starting a new series on the first but I won't do it on this 2005 game. Even when the game launches at the right resolution, it looks very old, but it is a 2005 DX9 game after all. Maybe they should ""remaster"" this one."

The age and jank of Fear made me laugh more than it frightened me. The game plays out as intermittent skirmishes with vulgar guards in scant industrial and workplace settings. Moments of Gmod horror fill up lonelier segments. Those darker portions are usually passive set-pieces yet set a reasonably tense atmosphere despite the focus on jumpscares and their overall intangibility. Highlights in gameplay are found in the brief encounters with the more unique enemy types. Slow-mo alone doesn't make gunplay a wholly unique experience, but it's enough to make for a few memorable and cinematic moments. It’s supposed badassery is also the catalyst for a lot of the game’s unintentional comedy. The direction, slight sci-fi elements, and pacing of Fear were enough to make me curious about the sequels that are a required purchase for access to this game.

The story is pretty interesting, and the mad psycho flashes you get can be pretty scary.

76561198168203059,1606848006,True,"A truly incredible, genre-defining FPS. I cannot recommend this enough to pretty much anyone interested in old shooters. This game got me really interested in games that blended action and horror together, which paved the way for me to try such gaming legends as System Shock 2 and Resident Evil 4, both games I adore to this day.

The story is deep and masterfully told, chock-full of mysteries that leave you wondering just as much about the events of the game afterward as you do at the start. Props to the game for both leaving the player alone against the enemies of the game, the Replicas, for long stretches of time, but crafting a truly creepy overall aesthetic that actually had my blood pumping many, MANY times throughout my many playthroughs. Alma Wade, the girl in the red dress, and Paxton Fettel, both of whom stalk the player during the events of F.E.A.R., are two of my all-time favorite video game antagonists, leaving a memorable mark on me years after playing it for the first time. The game's environments, ranging from industrial areas to office buildings to run-down apartments to sewers and subway tunnels, together with the well-done lighting, ambient sounds and haunting music, build a horror experience that is un-f*cking-matched by almost all other games I've ever played. The combat shines brightly, even so long after it came out, featuring a slow-motion mechanic blended seamlessly into the highly-enjoyable shooting. Weapons vary just enough to not be overwhelming while giving plenty of options, and all of them are fun to use, especially the shotgun. It rips enemies to shreds at close range, often vaporizing them into red mist and guts, and good LORD is it so damn satisfying.

So many moments through the game are unforgettable; getting the Penetrator for the first time and going to town on the Replicas' heads; seeing Alma Wade watching you around corners, darting in front of you unexpectedly and just showing up where she logically shouldn't; Paxton Fettel crooning at you about a coming war in one of the laboratories in Armacham HQ (which scared the ever-loving SH*T out of me when playing for the first time, at night, with good audio); witnessing the absolutely incredible enemy AI when they killed me by distracting me, flanking from a side I wasn't looking at and using a nearby explosive barrel, all for the first time, which I just gawked at with the biggest, dumbest smile on my face; utterly losing it when getting attacked by the stealth-camo Replicas in a set of offices, something I did not see coming at all...I could go on and on, this game is astoundingly memorable. Also can't go without mentioning the soundtrack; as somebody who really appreciates a good soundtrack, this one is just the perfect blend of creepy and ambient when it needs to be, and fast-paced and pumping during combat, every single individual track is a must-listen, even without actually playing the game. I just felt...unnerved while playing F.E.A.R., almost all the time, and that's most of the reason why I'm praising this game so much; it does what it set out to do, to both horrify and enthrall the player with its terrifying atmosphere, more-than-competent enemies, varying weapons, fun-as-hell slow-mo mechanic, and its story which, while perhaps confusing at first, makes almost perfect sense, and is surprisingly worth paying attention to, when researched afterward.

As you can see, I love F.E.A.R. to death, and praise it as one of the action-horror shooter genre's greatest titans of innovation, and IMO comparable with titans of this much-needed niche like the aforementioned System Shock 2 and Resident Evil 4."

This game is simple but fun. The game looks and plays great even now, and I ran the game in Ultrawide (3440x1440) with no issues. 

I'm having a hard time putting into words what to say about it, so instead I'm going to list of some games it reminds me of. If you like these games or see yourself liking a combination of these games, then this might be worth picking up. 

* Resident Evil 7
* Half-Life 1-2
* The Evil Within 1-2
* Blood 2 
* Doom 3
* Max Payne

I guess my minor nitpicks would be that almost every time I thought I found a secret, it was usually the path I was supposed to take. I feel like this game could have benefited from more legitimate secrets. I imagine for the time this game was a little more unique and scary, but by today's standards it's pretty mild. 

I'd give the game a solid 7.5/10."
76561198192587881,1606697970,False,"Great game, but you have to buy the entire fear bundle just to get it for some fucking reason. Buy it on GOG, the other two are barely worth playing."
76561197972331413,1606694652,True,"Great Timeless Action/Horror FPS.
The one thing I've failed to see done in any other game to this day is F.E.A.R.'s ability to switch from an action packed sequence, to a creepy thriller (Jump scare) type of game.  One minute a bunch of creepy things are happening, then you walk down to the end of the hallway or drop from the vent, and your put up against a squad (or few) of military soldiers. Its so engaging since it requires you to pay attention to the game so that you don't get ambushed - be it by Men or monster.

You long to get to the next shootout, yet you don't rush through the horror sequences as you won't know what weird anomaly lies around the next corner.  Shootouts are fun, you shoot up the room and guys go flying, i'd say something close to the matrix (Especially with the super fun bullet time)  its so fun youll wanna replay them so make sure to save (around the middle of the game it gets really juicy) Thats where the replay value is in this game. 

Story wise its pretty average but it is entertaining considering the date of the game.  There is not really any character development as you are a silent protagonist (albeit with a dark secret) so you wont really cling to any characters. 

Really, the take away is the  shootouts. The combination of Physics, Environmental Damage, satisfying gunplay, slowmo makes it superfun to speed run through. 
"
76561198139212358,1606685957,True,"I highly recommend F.E.A.R. for many reasons, even for the 60$ that they shoved together with the two other F.E.A.R. games. First of all, the combat is great. The AI is top notch, and while it isn't the most advanced AI, it surely is a smart one that feels great to fight against and overcome with intelligence and slow motion. The gun play is really nice, especially with the guns having sounds, like bullet shells hitting the floor for example, beyond just the shooting, and with the destructive power and everything really well balanced to kill hostiles fast and quick, everything works so damn well together to create a impactful and amazing combat that I surely cannot forget. The horror is also pretty decent, although it isn't something I am going to praise that much since until I played Extraction Point I really didn't get scared. However, it does ramp up, especially in the memorable Extraction Point DLC. Finally, the plot is intreging and is very inspirational, with a great soundtrack and memorable moments of horror, twists, and villains to really impact me, especially near the end when everything starts to come to a close.

Extraction Point is a BIG recommendation for me. It's better than the first game, and unlike the sequels it is impactful, entertaining, and surely will leave your jaw unhinged when you get to the end of the DLC. Although I don't recommend playing the second DLC that I won't name here, I have to say Extraction Point is a better game overall, and I will consider that the true sequel, unlike the garbage that was F.E.A.R. 2, which left no impact on me in the slightest. Sure, you might be left with a cliffhanger because it's a DLC, but god damn it I recommend it just because it's that good.

Overall, 9/10 for the main game and a 10/10 for Extraction Point. The other DLC will get a 5/10, and the 'sequels' will get a 2/10 for ruining any chance for this game to truly thrive."

76561198800819356,1606521589,True,"First off, the way this game is being sold is pretty shameful. Basically you can't buy F.E.A.R 1 separately and instead have to buy a $50 bundle that comes with dlc and both F.E.A.R sequels. This is obviously done to push copies of the latter games which were not received all that well. This is not a problem if you buy this bundle on sale though, because the first game is well worth $10. 

Other than that, F.E.A.R is an amazing first person shooter that holds up today. It's no surprise that this game was developed by the same people  who made blood, another amazing game. 

The visuals are nothing mind-blowing but are very effective at what they do. The sound design is very good. The gameplay is amazing and extremely rewarding (it never gets old either). The story is good for what it is, but doesn't shove itself in your face so if you are just playing for the shooting, that's fine. The engine had some performance issues and frame drops when I first installed but if you google ""F.E.A.R fps fix"" you can easily patch it in less that 5 minutes. 

Just buy this game, it's a fun time. If you don't wanna buy this but are interested in the gameplay, there's a free game demo on steam called ""TrePang 2"" which is amazing and definitely worth a play."

76561199101762724,1606342875,False,Would not properly boot up and caused my PC to crash. Will edit this review after I find a solution.
76561198113914725,1606330816,True,"Phenomenal shooter. Good horror. The shooting is S.A.T.I.S.F.Y.I.N.G., from the sound effects, to the gun animations, to the knockback your enemy experiences into a bloody mess after death. The movement is pretty decent, not as great as the source engine, but the sluggishness is made up for by the bullet time mechanic. I have NEVER seen bullet time done so well and satisfying, serving as a great tool to both those inexperienced to the genre and FPS veterans.

F.E.A.R is a corridor shooter, like DOOM, Hexen, and Wolfenstein 3D. In F.E.A.R.'s case, the player traverses many office buildings, sewers, concrete open rooms, and rooftops. There are few games since this one that have used that formula at all, and to see this game use it so successfully makes it stand out among its contemporaries. It's actually very reminiscent of the original Half-Life, with many combine-like enemies and police forces to fight, just with the paranormal tacked on instead of aliens. My main complaint with the enemy variety is the lack of stronger enemies, like unique bosses.

Even the story is pretty good. The strength in the narrative lies in all the phone messages and laptop intel you can collect along the way, to try to piece together the story as it has happened leading up to the present. That's why the ending is so great, since all the buildup actually pays off. Please, play F.E.A.R. if you even remotely enjoy shooters, you won't regret it."

Everybody, I guess I had to
Go to that place
To get to this one
Now some of you
Might still be in that place
If you're tryin' to get out
Just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around
It's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally
For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand come (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm

76561198076479022,1606273448,True,"The combination of excellent A.I behavior and satisfying gunplay is what makes F.E.A.R the undisputed king of gunfights in vidya.

You'll get constantly flanked, cornered, and absolutely demolished by the unrelenting enemy forces. That's the case if you play it on the maximum difficulty, which I would advise to try.

The claustrophobic environments and well accomplished physics, accompanied with a pretty simple but clever lightning technique is just the cherry on top to make the encounters quite intense.

The story and its spooky factor is just there as an excuse for the events to unfold and let you wreak havoc. At least that's how I always felt about it, its nothing out of the ordinary.

F.E.A.R. is just about the gunfights and having fun with the awesome gameplay, at least for me. 

That's the reason why I think the sequels were not well received. Since instead of improving upon what made this game unique they went a bit more heavy on the story and streamlined the gameplay.

tl;dr Excellent shooter with incredibly fun gunplay, intense firefights and pretty good A.I."
76561198167018501,1606231615,True,GOOD NICE
76561198047767496,1606183953,True,"FEAR has everything: janky mid-2000s physics, slow-motion on demand from the start of the game, improbably powerful dual-wielded pistols, a shotgun that messily vaporizes people, impressive enemy AI for the era, and ludicrously satisfying butterfly and slide kicks. Despite the godlike power it gives the player, it somehow also manages to be really fucking creepy when it wants to.

You do have to acclimatize to somewhat idiosyncratic default controls - SHIFT to aim, anyone? - and I've heard it can take a little tinkering to run on some modern systems, but it runs just fine on a clean install on my Win7 machine. All I had to do under the hood was change the FOV.

The sequels frankly don't measure up, but if you like FPS, especially with a bit of horror, you don't have much excuse not to play the original. BLOOD's blood ran strong within Monolith in those days."
76561198040235958,1606071245,True,"Short answer: One of my top gaming moments ever is thanks to this game.  Me vs a mech wielding a missle launcher.  All I had was a shotgun, bullet time, and a bunny hop.  I won without any damage.  This game is brilliant.

Less short version: Get this game.  The horror elements bog it down ironically, but this is one of the higher octane shooters from yesteryear.  Once I got it to acceptable resolutions and FOV, it was a blast to play.  The story is fine and the ending cliffhanger is a classic, if a bit tired and predictable.  The weapons mostly fun to use.  The shotgun, as I mentioned, is a gem of a weapon that not many shotguns of other shooters can even compare with.  Buy it now."

76561198171441691,1605913434,True,"TLDR; A very solid 8/10, if you even remotely like tactical shooters and games with a lot of heart and atmosphere you'll fall in love with this. Somehow I got this game with the expansion packs and not the whole franchise on Steam, but apparently you can't do that anymore. Unless you want the game's decent sequel and horrible threequel too, get it from GOG instead.

F.E.A.R. is probably the tightest and most brilliantly designed FPS ever, and you've probably heard a bit about it. The Replica AI that seems just as smart as you are, the awesome slow-mo mechanic, and the balance between tactical and tense action and atmospheric horror are all things the game receives constant praise for. But what's really brilliant about this game is how it takes those elements and lets it shine.

In F.E.A.R., you've got only one primary gameplay loop, which is close quarters combat with Replica soldiers, broken up by frightening and atmospheric walking sections, and Monolith made sure that every aspect about it was perfect. A lot of games have smart AI, hell, Half-Life 2 technically has smart AI. But what sets F.E.A.R.'s Replica soldiers apart from the seemingly dumb-as-rocks Combine is how the level design can be used to their benefit. They can dive through windows, peek around corners, crawl under pipes, and improvise cover. And the level design is carefully crafted to suit that, which is why you don't really get a lot of open outdoor combat or very adventurous locations featuring them. Admittedly it does get samey, although you end pitted against several mechs, [spoiler] a fat guy with a p0rn addiction's turrets [/spoiler], and [spoiler] hordes of unexplained scary ghosts that can kill you [/spoiler] at various points in the game.

And then there's you. Unlike many of its contemporaries, F.E.A.R. makes the player into a fragile little shit who can't tank a few mags to the face, and on higher difficulties this becomes even more true. Despite that, every action you can take against your enemy is extremely satisfying to pull off. You have a variety of weapons that you can only carry three of at a time, and they're all amazing to use. Even the horrible assault rifle Replicas carry is aided by the sound of bullets sinking into Kevlar, the exploding glass and plaster shrouding the area in a mist, and the classic exploding barrels and gas lines you can use to your benefit. Every weapon has a use and you don't ever feel like any are redundant, which makes you just as excited to find a new weapon as you are saddened to throw one away. You can also plan ahead or spice up the scenario with three types of grenades - the frag/impact grenade, the remote grenade, and the mine, which have the greatest explosion sound and GFX known to man. And finally, for when things get too hairy, you have the slow-mo mechanic, which while lasting for a limited time makes you feel like the hardest G on Earth when you decimate three soldiers in a few seconds without a scratch on you. With a pistol. All of the above things makes each playthrough, hell, each reloaded save, play out entirely different from the last one. When you and your enemies have that much ability, its game on.

What else can I say about this game? Probably everything in between. F.E.A.R.'s story isn't the greatest in gaming, not even close, but it's pretty compelling and it'll make you mad when the final installment in the series absolutely trashes it. It's told conservatively through brief in-game cutscenes, answering machines, and laptops that will make you feel old. Characters like Betters, Paxton Fettel, Harlan Wade, and Alma are all very memorable. It's worth caring about, even if the final twist doesn't really make sense in my mind.

The atmosphere is also top notch and it has its own voice, aided by the sharp contrasted lighting, the art direction, and the awesome ambient pieces that play throughout the game that still hold up. The whole game feels genuinely haunted. As for the actual in-your-face horror; it'll scare you on the first playthrough but it becomes very predictable and less unsettling afterwards. If there was one thing the third game did right, it was dynamic scares, which, along with the health and reflex boosters hidden around each level, would make this game's replay value even greater. So if you're going into this game looking for something really terrifying, you might be disappointing after the first run.

That's about it. It's fucking great, buy it (on GOG)."

76561198024277715,1605356018,True,"[h1] Underrated Classic! [/h1]
What an absolute pleasure it has been to finally experience this after having heard whispers of its brilliance over the years and i can certainly see why!

Whilst on the surface it may seem like just another generic corridor shooter that ought to be lost to time , it's mechanics actually hold up superbly well! Seriously, your modern day CODs and Battlefields wishes it had an AI + Level Design combo work this well together that the illusion of an actually thinking and strategic enemy works! Gunplay is satisfying and fun - especially that VK-12 Shotgun ;) and the added [i] Slo-Mo [/i] effect system provides numerous opportunities to create John Woo/ Matrix style badass moments (especially if you're playing on the[b] extreme[/b] difficulty). 

Whilst the graphics do obviously feel slightly dated, the lighting system especially in corridors work surprisingly well to add to the creep and 'whats around the corner' factor with the horror elements in the game , The story is intriguing and engaging enough to make you want to push on and reach the conclusion.

Being an old game however, i encountered a number of issues regarding compatibility and was forced to go through some hurdles to get the game to run properly as well as experiencing a number of crashes during my playthrough. The level design also tends to be rather repetitive , as if they seemingly copy and pasted all of the same office/hotel building corridors with a different layout on each new mission. (apparently due to budget constraints at the time) 

Overall, it's a definitely a thumbs up and recommendation! F.E.A.R awaits.

1) it has an excellent single player campaign with a nice plot, immersive ambience, challenging AI and varied places and scenes.
2) the multiplayer is just awesome.

76561198137267727,1605053464,True,"F.E.A.R is the greatest unintentional comedy game perhaps ever made. Now while that might throw a lot of people off because you may be thinking ""So its just like the room and has no redeeming qualities besides the fact that its so bad its good?"" Kinda. F.E.A.R is a game that is outrageously absurd but wears a mask of complete seriousness and ""horror"" (if you could even call it that tbh). From how all the characters talk to one another like sailor frat boys (i.e. they swear a lot), or the outrageous gratuitous gorey violence, and the surprising realism of the enemy soldiers with how they move and flank your position and how they shout ""OH SHIT"" right before i blow their Fucking heads off. It really is a fantastic power fantasy with a silly little plot that takes itself way too seriously to tie it all together in a blood red bow. And if you have been reading this thinking this is a negative review, then on the contrary. It's all the reasons above mentioned why i cant recommend F.E.A.R enough. Yeah running it on modern hardware is a pain with its constant frame drops, but after digging through the steam community and finding a small download, it erased all problems, and i could happily pin guys to the wall with my rail gun and shotgun their legs off in 144 FPS -  8/10"

You can buy it separately from here, goes on sale pretty often.
Its a good game, fun gun fights, good horror, biggest problem is optimization. Theres a patch you can download to help performance, but even after downloading it I was still experiencing a lot of issues with stuttering and textures. But the odd thing is I only experienced the stuttering when I was standing upright in the game, when I was crouching there was no stuttering. Other then that a very fun game, definitely a steal for ten dollars. Also side note with the purchase you get the two expansions for free."

76561198021918856,1604893236,True,"Where do I start, this game has been the embodiment of my childhood and in my opinion not one game has come close to the gameplay mechanics and AI pathmaking and behavior than this. The story is from late 2005 and is still more interactive and immersive than 99.99999% of the games that have come out since then. To the people complaining that this game is too hard as you go on, I beat the game and the expansions on extreme difficulty. All you have to do is lean your corners, have good management of slowmo in fights, and aim for the head, the mech fights are somewhat challenging but not that bad. And always take a second look around for health and slowmo upgrades before you move on to the next area.

Lastly, to all the people really not recommending this absolute gem of a game because of the price, maybe you can use more than 2 brain cells and understand that the steam store is not the only place to get steam games. *cough* *cough* g2a *cough* *cough*, their are many ways to get around corporate greed on old material.

The AI and the level design have excellent synergy that keeps fights engaging and fun throughout the game. They absolutely nail the creepy atmosphere with the lighting and sound design, and Alma is straight-up terrifying. The mystery surrounding Alma and her relationship to the player character drew me in and had me listening to/reading all the lore I could find in the game. My only criticism of the game is that it felt disjointed. The shooting and horror sections mostly exist independently with the transitions between them clearly telegraphed. A must-play for any fan of horror games."
76561198065752770,1604875227,True,"So I've only played this game for a couple hours and it is certainly living up to its reputation, for me. I just have one major, and persistent, problem and that has to do with the framerate. I'm running this thing on some pretty high end stuff. Like I run games like spacehulk deathwing on all max settings and run it's smooth as silk. However, why is this game seemingly locked around 25 frames...except its not when it decides to randomly jump to like 145....but then it still doesn't when it decides to just tank to sub 10 FPS after playing for not that long with the only fix being to restart the game? I just don't understand why this 2005 game is giving me so many problems with the frames being unstable. (Just look up FEAR framerate fix and there will be a link to a steam community post with a link to a download for a file that will fix it. All you need is 7zip to get it and it's as simple as dragging and dropping a single file into where your .exe for the game is. Also works with the expansions, but you have to put the fix file into each one)"

Do you want to feel like Neo took ghostbusting lessons and specialized in dropkicking soldiers? Good choice.

What makes F.E.A.R. incredible is no matter how many firefights you get into you never become truly comfortable with combat.

I honestly wish Monolith would develop more games like this, even though their take on LOTR is really good."

76561198849526367,1603736770,True," I'm going to talk about the main game and its DLC here. This is the first installment in the F.E.A.R. franchise, an FPS horror game. To be vague, for the purposes of your enjoyment's preservation, FEAR is all about stopping a madman with a cybernetic army at his disposal. Apart of the FEAR (First Encounter Assault Recon) team, a secret government army dedicated to responding to supernatural disturbances, you venture deeper into this rabbithole which gets deeper and more confusing as you fall. As for the DLC, Extraction Point follows the main protagonist (Pointman) through the aftermath of the main game, filling in the ending which almost left so much to be desired. Perseus Mandate follows another FEAR team through their mission to discover the project which began this entire mess in the first place.
 But FEAR's story pales in comparison to the gameplay which it is remembered so fondly for. The main game is about 6-7 hours long, the DLCs being each 4-5 extra. Bear in mind all of what I say here is in context of Moderate difficulty, higher difficulties may have exceptions. All of it is filled with interesting and unique enemy encounters. The environments which facilitate these encounters allow for a multitude of ways to go about it, which enables both you and the enemies to perform some interesting things. There's so open, nature-like areas in FEAR, only tight industrial areas which populate the disturbed city. If you're keen, collectibles which boost your stats are riddled across the map, along with hidden caches of ammo. The AI is also quite smart, being able to see your flashlight, shoot through cover at you, flank your position, and talk with their buddies. Enemy types vary from a lower foot soldier to a titan wielding a tower shield and a minigun, even invisible assassins! You can wield three of the many weapons at once, changing between them as you see fit (assuming the weapon you want is available to be grabbed). You can have pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, or even laser weapons which cleave people in two, or a gun which shooting forking lightning bolts, or maybe you'd prefer the minigun I mentioned before? Or, even, a particle weapon which melts the enemies down to their charred skeletal remains? There's no shortage of weapons in this game and all playstyles are supported. By the way, did I mention you can slow down time? Yeah, you have ""reflexes"" which allow you to temporarily slow down time, giving you room to gun down multiple enemies at once. The DLCs provide more weapons to use and enemies to encounter, with Perseus Mandate being the best, and hardest, in that regard. The DLCs are harder than the main game, be assured, but add on sufficiently to the original idea. Play EP first, then PM. It's the proper order, really, though you don't need to do so in order to understand what's happening. The gameplay is a thrill ride, though its age definitely shows in the movement and in certain mechanics. 
 This game looks impressive for 2005, though it is complicated by some issues. First, you'll notice your framerate is likely deteriorating the longer you play. There is a fix for this, which I would provide a link to if I were allowed. But it's called DirectInput FPS Fix, and there's a steam page for it somewhere. There's also an issue with the DLCs where they crash upon level transitions. This is due to a flaw in the coding; a memory leak which doesn't work well with newer PCs. There's also a steam page for this, a link to a 4 GB patch which stops this issue from happening. There's also a problem with Extraction Point where the resolution cannot be changed to 1080 in the menu. You need to find the config file, change it to a notepad doc, and manually change it. There's a steam page for this, as well. Once you do that, never go into display. It will revert your resolution back to potato level and you will have to fix it again. With these three things in mind, you'll have no issue running this game as you should be able to.
 FEAR, despite its rampant technological issues and the jank of decades, is a great FPS experience. The horror is pretty cheap and doesn't do much in regards to scaring you, but there is an eerie vibe in the game, especially when all goes silent and you fear the next attack you know will come. If you love games like Half-Life and Halo, FEAR will be something to check out. The music is tense and at times proves very impressive (especially Garage Battle and Vatortune). 8/10, SHUT THE FUCK UP"
76561198336395164,1603724036,True,"This game was brilliant no wonder boomers shill it so hard, good gun play, good atmosphere and was scary at times too."
76561198082419386,1603696529,True,"F.E.A.R. is a horror-fps game, where you play as Point Man, who have inhuman reflexes and your job is to work on cases which other authoroties would not work on it, and now an army of clones getting through the city, and it's leader is connected with you somehow... even with your past.

F.E.A.R. made in 2005, and it aged decent. It doesn't look that bad, I really liked the shadows and the water in the game, but the bullet holes and the physics is amazing in this game too. There are visual bugs, like props get into each other or sometimes weapons go in to wall / floor, seeing through the wall, but for me F.E.A.R. looks okay.

Controls is fine, you need to use more than just going around and shoot, but you can get use to it. One thing I didn't understand, is that if I change my granade type to remote granades, why my character change his weapon to the original one? It was really weird, but other than that, it's okay.

Music and sound... how to make a good horror game 101? Make your sound creppy and good. F.E.A.R. did it, and music is also banging, but most of the time it's chilling. Voice actors doing their jobs well, one of the most stable point in the game.

Gameplay is quite interesting. Usually, you go forward, kill enemies, if your path is cut, you found an alternative or do a small ""go there, activate it and come back"" part, you get scared and you get story. This is how I can describe it... however what F.E.A.R. is interesting, is the scares / story, and the mechanics.

Scares are really good, however some of them bit goofy in 2020, but still do an awesome job. Story is really weird and full of chaos, but if you look for more information, you can understand it and you will know a tragic one indeed, which makes the whole series.

The mechanic I mentioned before is the reflex. You can slow time in your favour, and take out your enemies easier. You can also extend your reflex, by picking up boosters and you can do the same with your HP. At the end of the game, you can have 200 HP. With slowed down time, you can see every particale around you, the bullets or rockets, even granades. One fun thing, is that you can shot down rockets or granades if your reflex is on, and it explodes in the air. This is definetly an interesting one for sure. I have to also mention the hand to hand combat in the game, which is fun to watch and the different weapons in the game.

F.E.A.R. is not without problem. There are bugs which sometimes game breaking and end you in that current save, so I suggest you to save often. The text size is really small if you play on FullHD, and the subtitles has a weird position in general. Some parts of the game are annoying or just boring, but this is probably my problem, or others think different about certain areas.

F.E.A.R. is a game, which still good to play in 2020, 15 years later when it first came out. I never played F.E.A.R. before, it was my first time, but I played too in 11-12 hours on Extreme difficutly with not too much death's, with 195 HP and lot of reflex boosters (almost every). I can definetly recommend you to play it if you have a bit nostalgia, or if you just new to the series."
76561198017369951,1603680762,True,"Still holds up! A fun roller-coaster ride and just what I needed this spooky season: jump scares with lots of action in between. The AI is still some of the better AI I've faced in a game, and it sets up setpieces extremely well with level design alone."

Recommended, play on hard from the start and get a real challenge. Also this game has some the most satisfying weapons I've ever used. Would love to see a 2020 remake."
76561198002716193,1603624127,True,"Masterpiece in every way.

F.E.A.R. is an exceptionally good game in every possible way. It got a great story line, horror elements, a perfect AI, intense action and beautiful graphics and sound, even to this day.

Back in 2008, when I first bought this game, I did not know what to expect. I thought it would be a horror game in which you need to run constantly from some girl. I was half right. When I first played it, I immediately got a sense of dread and uncomfortableness and when the first horror elements came to play, I shat my pants. I could not play this game without someone sitting next to me. It was just to damn scary, and for that it will always have my deepest respect.

The story is powerful and interesting, I am not going to spoil it, this is something you need to experience for yourself. It has kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole game and made an impression on me that lasts forever. 

The graphics in F.E.A.R. are beautiful. They are dark and gloomy and gives a nonstop sense that something is going horribly wrong the whole game. The fact that you need to use a flashlight constantly and risking that you see something ungodly afterwards keeps you shivering. 

The sound is also perfect, the sound of bullet impacts, gun shots, explosions, and the bone screeching sound effect when you see something straight out of a nightmare really enhanced the experience. When you shoot a pistol or shotgun the blast sounds legit and really makes you feel that you are shooting a freaking gun instead of a pea shooter. The sounds enemies make when you kill their asses or blast them out of existence is also really, really satisfying. 

F.E.A.R. has some of the best AI I have ever seen in a video game, even to this day. The AI is simply perfect. Enemies communicate with each other; they react to your every move and adapt their strategy on it. Also, when you encounter a squad of four enemies and obliterate three of their buddies, the fourth one panics and his accuracy and will to fight drops instantly. Comments like “We can’t stop him” gives you a feeling of power, you are in control of this fight motherf*cker. Enemies can lose sight of you in a battle, giving you back your edge. They are definitely not the bullet sponges in games today.

The slow-motion feature in F.E.A.R. was also unique for its time and really helps you in your fights. If you are flanked by the smart AI Replica soldiers you use your slow motion to take back control of the situation. The only downside of this, is that the game is quite easy because of it. If you are having trouble with a certain part, just use your slow motion and everything will be fine. Especially when you upgraded its bar to the max. 

The game has a perfect balance between intense action and horror and sometimes both at the same time. 
I never had to change so many diapers on myself as with this game. Nowadays I played F.E.A.R. so much I know every jump scare, every horror scene and fight so it is nothing special anymore but still it gets me sometimes. 

I cannot think of anything bad about this game. It is just perfection.

F.E.A.R. has a special place in my black heart and will always be one of the games that I can play anytime, anywhere. The replay value is high for me. In my opinion, it is a masterpiece. 

I recommend F.E.A.R. in every way. You must have played it at least once before you grow old and senile."

You want good gun action, look no further. Even the graphics still hold up really well.

If you're someone who doesn't like horror games very much, like me, F.E.A.R. not. Despite being a game literally called F.E.A.R. it's actually not super spooky. Yeah it has the dark atmosphere, the occasional short horror segment and even some minor jumpscares sprinkled in (very few), but it's not too bad and you probably won't be losing any sleep over this game.

76561198113351917,1603228676,True,"Had a real fun time with this game alright.
The gun fights are a blast and the enemy AI makes it really fun since they actually work together to flank you, flush you out and defend against your attempts to push;For once you're fighting enemies that aren't just brain dead robots. What I love the most, is if you cut their line of sight on you, they'll check the place where they last spotted you and will actively search the area , making having the element of surprise all the more satisfying when in most games enemies will know your location no matter what.
It's a real fun challenge with them on higher difficulty settings as well.

[b] Shocking how this game is nearly 2 decades old and the AI in here still rivals that of most games today. [/b]

If you're looking for a lore filled experience, you might find an interesting story here but it's mainly told in a straight forward manner. You can however pick up bits an pieces of the story to help fill the gaps that the game doesn't straight up tell you. I feel like the game was mainly to show off its cool gun play than to have a lore filled plot.
I haven't actually discovered any bugs or issues which is strange considering I'am playing on a potato laptop with barely the minimum requirements to run this. So I suggest giving this game a try especially if it's on a sale so you can buy the bundles. It's definitely a series worth playing if you enjoy a good FPS or if you just enjoy the nostalgic aesthetic those early 2000s games have."

This was my very first modern triple A experience, back when I still used a 720 square monitor. 

My mind was blown away, however, because I had no scope of what a good game is, I forgot all about it.

Brought this on steam when it came out and played again, and It dawn to me just how amazing this game is. Yes, the graphics are outdated to today's standards, and shooting without slowmo feels wrong in every way, but the immersion and reply value of this game puts some of the modern shooter titles to shame.

If you can overlook the graphics, I believe you will have the greatest time of your life playing this masterpiece.

76561197972297308,1603032245,True,"I remember playing this game when it came out, and replaying it 15 years later it's still just as fun as I remember it.

With tight shooting, a nice variety of weapons, smart enemies, and a creepy story, what more could you want?

Playing on  extreme difficulty (which I recommend for people who are used to FPS games), as long as you play smart, fight from behind cover and listen to enemy conversations you should be fine. If you get hit you die really fast, but you have a slow motion ability to bail you out of sticky situations, and there are plenty of first aid kits scattered throughout the game.

The enemy AI is great. They will rarely make mistakes, but if you listen to their interactions you can usually tell how they're going to act. And sometimes you even get funny interactions like this one:
- Enemy 1 walks down a corridor and gets shot.
- Enemy 2: ""Move in!""
- Enemy 3: ""No way.""
I don't know why, but I just thought this sounded very natural. ""That guy just got shot over there, and you want me to move in!? Forget about it.""

F.E.A.R. is an FPS game first, horror game second, but if you're a fan of either (or both), I definitely recommend giving F.E.A.R. a try.

Now I'm really looking forward to playing through the expansions and sequels which I have never played before."

В основе - FPS в хоррор тематике с вкусным slo-mo, расчленёнкой, относительно умными ботами и захватывающим(С) сюжетом. Местами радует ""старыми"" механиками типа ""жри аптечки вручную"", а не эти нынешние авторегены.

Даже в 2020-м шпилить приятно. С помощью рандомного гайда из комьюнити даже воссоздал впечатления от своего ПК тех времён. Чуть Reshade, капля 'raytracing' и игра идёт прям как в тогда - 30 фпс.

Разумеется очень многое сейчас выглядит устаревшим - анимации, освещение, текстурки/модельки.
Но при этом ощущается оно поразительно хорошо для 15-летней игры (в этом смысле можно сравнить с HL2, пожалуй).

Так что ежели каким-то чудом пропустили это творение - рекомендую восполнить пробел.

F.E.A.R. may be an old game, and it's clear when it comes to the graphics and sound, but it's also one of the most enjoyable games to play.

There wasn't much in the way of creepy stuff, a jump scare and a few moments that where kind of predictable, but I think that the action kept it from being creepy.  Also the first 7 intervals dragged on a bit.  But those where pretty much the only downsides.

Grab it on sale if you can, give it a go, but do a google search if you encounter FPS issues on Windows 10 as there is a fix for those.

⍟ «Extraction Point» is a good non-canon sequel with even more horror moments. It pass pretty quickly.

[b]The only game I'll ever call timeless[/b][hr][/hr]
F.E.A.R. is a game that I think everyone of a certain age knows of whether they've played it or not. Weirdly my first experience with it was on youtube, where people fixated on the 'horror' segments where a blocky kid in a red dress appears in a window or whatever. There are no real jump scares, and it's not a scary game, but we all thought it was when this was peak performance. The story and the spooks hardly matter though, and it's not at all why anyone's still playing it.

At a time where the 15GB install was enough to make me buy a new hard drive, the visuals and gameplay were just downright astounding. Leaning around an office cubicle to blow a dude away in a spray of blood, sparks, and plaster dust with a SPAS-12. It made me giddy. It didn't run well, but it looked amazing, and gave me my first fluidly tactical experience in a shooter (because Rainbow Six and SWAT were very tactical, but man, the movement). Nowadays? It holds up, it's like the experience I thought I had when I was younger. Playing it at 144hz with crispy resolution and a pair of sennheisers, it's a super smooth, immersive experience.  

The weird thing is that it's just kinda set in an office block and a bunch of sewers, yet the environments feel great. You'd think they'd be boring, but the way they just blow apart when you're annihilating clones, filling the air with dust and bits of computer, they're fantastic. Just as they start getting old, they open up into a more executive suite, or you spend some time in city streets, or a lab. It's grounded but elevated by the whole slow-mo thing, and the fact that you're shooting clone soldiers with future-guns. In fact, whenever it deviates from its core features, it starts falling short: ceiling turrets, ghosts, laser drones, they're all the weakest elements of the game, and 'boring' offices and 'regular' dudes with guns are where it shines. It's an ironic sort of game, but it's been my favourite single-player FPS since '05, and I can't see that changing any time soon."

It's a very good and atmospheric game. Gunplay is solid and very satisfying. Sound is excellent and adds a lot to the atmosphere.
although graphics are a bit outdated, it still looks quite good due to its lighting effects.
I played it back then, so I was prepared for its jump scares but its still quite creepy.
And then there is the absolutely great AI, propably one of the games with the best AI I've ever played.
I definitely recommend this game, it's a very unique experience!!!!"
76561197965346000,1602552844,True,Some of the best game play / storytelling in a FPS/Horror game. Worth a replay.

76561198125347341,1602457418,True,"I'm going to compare F.E.A.R. to you going on an imaginary last minute roadtrip with some side/barely friends. (Stay with me here, it makes sense, trust me I'm telling you it does)

You kinda wanted to go but you didn't want to deal with the extra baggage (Having to purchase this game in a bundle with a bunch of other shitty games, but for the most part you can ignore them). 

There's a bunch of hoops you need to go through to actually be able to go on the trip since your parents don't know these kids, and don't really trust them (Downloading some dll files to make the game not run like shit or in some cases function at all). 

They said we were going to Yellowstone to check out geysers which sounded alright, but somehow ended up at The Grand Canyon checking that out and to be honest probably ended up being more fun then if you went to Yellowstone (It says its a horror game but it just has anywhere between weird to creepy aesthetics with the occasional jumpscare, honestly its just more like Half-Life in that the environments have a *this place reeks* atmosphere with awesome gunplay and cool looking, smart enemies which is better then if it went full horror (DOOM 3)).

You don't really know whats happening most of the time and kinda are just following along since you only like half know everyone but the end collage of videos and pictures one of them made for literally no reason sort of puts everything into perspective (At the end of the game you get a weird exposition dump that seems to attempt to make up for the entire game never making sense story-wise and to be honest I still don't really understand it but to play this game for the story must mean you're some kinda of weird masochist).

There's also this one girl who went who is pretty, but you never got past first base with her and the only thing you really got from her is a nice ass to look at every once in a while (Pretty much the gameplay is good but like it never gets into that rhythm that turns any game from a fun game to a masterpiece).

Don't get me wrong, the roadtrip was fun, but its not like if you went with all your best friends to some cool place that meant something to all of you (Half-Life).

Basically the game is fun but that's about it.

76561198983374589,1602442687,True,"Ah yes, F.E.A.R.. This is one of my favorite shooters out there. I also think it is one of the best if not THE best shooters out there. Its also a horror game. 

The gameplay excels in this game (which it should ofcourse). The gameplay really works well, despite it being an old game. It can be seen as a bit outdated but I think it aged really well. For some reason this game achieves a certain feeling, a gameplay feeling that only shooters from this era can achieve. It is a horror game so the levels are very linear, as linear as a game can get. The shooting mechanics feel really realistic. It really feels like the bullets do serious damage to the enemy. The gunfights are really really cool. You can zoom in for more accuracy (no ADS), you can lean left and right, different types of weapons, throwables etc. The enemy AI is rather smart. They feel alive, like they actually have a mind of their own, unlike some more recent game AI's... The game is a horror game so the atmosphere does have a very horror vibe to it. There are some jump scares and scary moments, but honestly I got more scared by the actual hostile enemies than what was supposed to scare me. 

The progression is divided into sequences. First sequence is a horror scary moment and then a sequence consisting of shooting bad guys and then repeat. Thats it. Repetitive for some, fun for others.

Story is pretty good, it does has some lore to it.

Combat is still rock solid, although with a bit of insider knowledge available commonly these days, I could see the tricks at work. But it still winds up being solid. The scary bits as many have mentioned are a bit nothing--not quite, in my opinion, enough to break up the ""fights with guys"" angle. When there are other enemies (the tanks and turrets) they behave much more conventionally for an FPS of that or even earlier vintage. But the regular goons are great--they jump through windows, they flank and go places the player hasn't been, and their chatter is engineered to make you think they're even smarter than they really are. It's enough to distinguish it thoroughly from Half-Life, though. The environments are good, the enemies are good if a little samey for an SF title, interactivity is sufficient, and the ending is as abrupt as MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL."

The characters are definitely forgettable, with the notable exceptions of Paxton and Alma. My final complaint has to do with how samey all the levels feel.

The kickass shooter by Monolith has aged, but it has aged well and still feels awesome. Back in 2005 this was a showcase for what the latest graphics cards could do, but there is much more than dated eye candy. Brutal combat, dark and moody environment, creepy supernatural things, evil story and stellar soundtrack were bound together in a way that has stood the test of time.

Some people have complained about technical issues with the game. Maybe I got lucky but the Steam version runs fine on my Windows 10, out-of-the-box.

At the moment it seems that Steam only offers the original F.E.A.R. as part of FEAR Complete Pack which includes all FEAR titles. Such all or nothing choice is regrettable. The expansion packs and FEAR 2 are more of the same with some improvements in graphics and small gameplay changes. As such they are almost as good investments as the original game. However FEAR 3 feels like a soulless attempt to milk a few more dollars out of the series.

Get it, but get it during the sales. Unless the original becomes available as a standalone purchase."

I don't think many first person shooters or horror games have done their single genres as well as F.E.A.R. does both genres.

Very fun, even after many years, definitely a tense game.

The gunplay is a lot like Half-life 1&2, but the guns aren't that varied from one another, but they are very fun to shoot. The slo mo is cool and necessary in order to survive. I wish there was more mobility like in Max Payne in order to make the most of the slo mo. The enemy AI is very good and always keeps you on edge as someone might pop out at any moment, adding to the horror. This game is very scary without relying on many jump scares. It has clever ways of forcing you to see things to scare you. Creepy imagery and audio make an intense atmosphere that turns me into such a pussy. I do think the action is better executed than the horror though. This game is a total classic and should be played."

The first couple chapters are a bit slow and feel repetitive, but the game steadily intensifies over time and the twists still pack a good punch (even knowing the ending beforehand from having played it before, it was just as effective the second time around). 

The sound design is really good and I feel like for when this came out, the enemy AI is not horrible. Weird favourite thing is shooting the replicas in the foot and they start to hop around."

76561197973397137,1601576720,True,"I've been playing F.E.A.R. since it came out in 2005. It has since remained my go-to for atmospheric horror and horror-based shooters. Despite its age, I feel it holds up really well compared to other games of that era. Even now, 15 years later, F.E.A.R. gives me goosebumps and when October arrives (like today) it has become my annual tradition to play through the game to get into the Halloween spirit. 

The graphics, though dated, are beautiful and while they do exist, the game doesn't rely on jump scares to keep the horror theme. It actually builds dread and unease over time and makes the effort to draw you into its weird world.

If you're looking for a horror game that isn't just gore and jump scares, F.E.A.R. is where you should start."

76561197972380182,1601511909,True,"Do you like running thru dark, gray halls and dark gray sewers and dark gray warehouses? Well this is the game for you!

Seriously though, it is a game of it's time so you have to go in with certain expectations. But other than that it does have some creative gameplay. The shooting is fun. The enemies have ragdoll physics which were new when this game was released. There's a stake gun that lets you pin flailing bodies to the wall. 

There's a horror aspect to it as well that mainly tries to use jump scares. You get used to them. 

It's a classic for a reason and as long as you go in with the right expectations you will have fun."
76561198041561934,1601507392,True,One of the best games ever
76561198027218016,1601494694,True,"The best out of the entire series, If your interested in this you should get it for the gunfights, their quick and hectic. The AI is a lot smarter then you'd expect for something that came out in 2005, it uses grenades to force you from cover, it endlessly works to flank and get an angle on you.  It still looks really nice too, the graphics are clean and have aged extremely well. It's not very scary, that might take away from your desire to play it but it really shouldn't, it's difficult to be scared when carrying a submachine gun, a rifle, a shotgun and a weaponized nail gun. 

But my overall impression is positive, it was a lot of fun shooting it still looks great for a 15 year old game, at this point it should run on just about anything you've got at hand. I will say the only issue I had was that the game will run at about 10 fps if you don't disable your HID compliant devices in your device manager because that interferes for some reason. 

I picked up the entire series on sale for like 12 dollars and now I'm wishing they'd made a better fear 3 because I want more of the first game"
76561198336152154,1601477594,True,Fear is a classic shooter that still holds up incredibly well in 2020. Its definitely the scariest out of the 3 main titles and has insane atmosphere for an action shooter. Really makes me miss the old Monolith even if all this was before my time
76561198251870802,1601445196,True,"Monolith Production's 2005 masterpiece (AKA F.E.A.R.) is a game that you can't call yourself a true FPS fan until you have played at least once.
The only real negative I can say about this game is its story if very mediocre and the police where only there to make the replicas less repetitive. That's really it. The only other negative but not a major one is the heavy gunners (or whatever their called) take way to many bullets and do too much damage, but that's it. Also one quick thing, you can only buy this game with in the F.E.A.R. bundle, you can no longer purchase by it's self.
There are a f*ck tone of pros, so get comfy. Amazing sound design. Amazing atmosphere. Great shooting. Slowmo is fun af. All weapons modelled really well. Great gore. Good voice acting. Amazing AI. Still looks great after 15 years. Amazing effects. Great lighting. Amazing level design. Good length. Free DLC. Great soundtrack. The amount of ways you can approach a level is near infinite. There are so many guns. Good melee combat. Not one encounter will be the same. If you replay a level, it will be different to the first time you played it. Great bullet time mechanics and is simply a super fun game.
F.E.A.R. is a must play, PERIOD! The amount of replayability is endless and the game shouldn't be called F.E.A.R., it should be called Monolith Production's 2005 masterpiece. 9.5/10, rightfully deserves."
76561198193484414,1601440320,True,Awesome
76561198170227350,1601422711,True,I've never played another FPS with combat like this so buy it if you love shooters. The real horror is when you plug in a logitech keyboard.
76561198084676159,1601362677,True,"In short: Elfen Lied as directed by John Woo and the Wachowski twins and as written by Tom Clancy.

Gameplay is F.E.A.R.'s strong point, as simply all the effects in the game are dialed up to 11. Shooting a wall produces sparks like white phosphorous, dust clouds can stay up for half a minute, guns sound mighty and thunderous, and standard enemies are never bullet sponges. When armoured enemies do show up, the game always provides the ammo, health and space to either stunlock them or dodge their attacks, the level design allows both you and the excellent enemy A.I. to make masterful moves in combat arenas, but not every engagement is a massive arena, many are smaller scale fights in hallways.

The weapons you use in the game are another massively strong point. F.E.A.R. manages an almost perfect balance with its weapons, as none are ever obsolete and none are ever too scarce to use, yet situations still often affect which weapon is ideal. Unlike many other games, I never picked up a gun in F.E.A.R. 1 and said ""man, can't wait to replace this"".
Should firearms fail, you can also go with the ever-satisfying kicks available.

The soundscape is another plus. The music is quite interesting, in that it never gets in the way and allows you to focus.
That isn't to say that it's terrible or that I hate music or that it's barely noticeable, but in that it almost perfectly compliments the game. If you put something like the Half-Life 2 or Command & Conquer soundtrack in here it would either be drowned out by the action or vice versa. F.E.A.R.'s soundtrack sounds simple enough to be a supporting element, yet complex enough to gel with the action. Otherwise, the sound effects are solid, especially on the guns, sounding loud and punchy, with the slight exception of some of the more outlandish guns, although their visual effects make up for this.

The graphics are interesting. Texture and model work is poor circa 2020, but the dynamic lighting is quite interesting, as it is everywhere, works great in combat and horror alike, and is very sharp, providing an interesting aesthetic, helped by the art direction, as most of the environments are quite drab, allowing notable objects to stand out better. So while on a technical level it is obsolete, there is a lot of design and thought that went into it to make everything stand out and still allow you to stay immersed. Plus, it works great on any computer younger than Keith Richards, though your OS may hate it.

The story is okay. Voice acting is good and I like the writing at points, but one of the main forms of exposition are static answering machines which kill the pacing a little, although they do add breather periods to build suspense. Many plot points run the spectrum from ""speculation material"" to ""poorly explained"", and the player being a silent protagonist makes it almost frustrating when it takes hours for the supporting cast to figure something out when you grasped it yonks ago.

Finally, the horror. Sometimes it can be just plain annoying, sometimes it can keep you on the edge of your seat. Most of it is just startles, though, and it is often undercut by horror sections being almost completely detached from combat sections, and often switched to extremely abruptly. Just in case you didn't get that it was a horror section, the game pops up a little indicator whenever something spooky happens which just kills the mystery. The scariest parts are when it doesn't prepare you.

Overall, a fantastic game."

Idk if there is a way to get around this but it runs fine until a cutscene plays and then it runs like it's been shot in both legs.  I'll probably toy with it a bit more to try and get it to run smoothly but 20 frames is not happening man.  I can settle for 30 if I absolutely must.

Will update this review if I can work out the kinks.  Still $10 for the bundle is not a bad deal :)

It bears mentioning that this game has one of the best AI systems that I've ever encountered.  On top of that the gameplay is very inspired and appealing.  You'll likely spend a lot of time in bullet mode because stationary pop shots won't serve you very well.  The horror elements of the game are... underwhelming most of the time but I'd be lying if I said a few of the jump scares didn't get me.  Little dead girls are creepy O.o


****Update****

Found it, this is going to be slightly annoying but the problem is my HID devices.  If you run into this too you'll have to open Device Manager, go down to Human Interface Devices, & disable ALL of the HID-Compliant devices :/

Switching to ""Yes Recommend"" because this is a fairly easy, albeit annoying fix.  Forgivable given this game released in 2005"

76561198049852592,1601090366,True,"I had heard of F.E.A.R. when it first game out but skipped it over because I didn't have a computer good enough to play it and the commercials were too scary for me. 

Fifteen years later and I picked up all the F.E.A.R. titles for $8 in a Humble Bundle and finally got to experience this great game.

The combat took me a few tries to get into. I kept trying to play it like a modern tactical shooter: staying in once place, popping out from behind cover, taking careful aim before firing. I soon learned that this is not the best way to play the game. This is very much a run and gun shooter in the tradition of Doom. 

The enemy AI is also fun and formidable. Clone soldiers will flank you, try to flush you out with grenades, and call out commands and warnings to each other in response to you actions. The result is explosive and hectic firefights that play out in small skirmishes over excellently designed levels.

The story is pretty good... it's told mostly through audio logs in the form of phone messages and laptop data. The characters aren't very compelling but the game has an interesting premise that kept me wanting to see what happened. The game is actually not very scary... there are a few horror sequences but are pretty well telegraphed ahead of time and easy to deal with.

There are some negatives. Parts of the game can drag on to long, and I did get stuck a few times trying to figure out how to progress. The way forward is sometimes hidden by and obscure entrance or a door won't open unless you turn a particular valve that looks similar to other vales which you can't interact with.

Overall I'd say this a very good game and still well worth a play through in 2020."
76561198083391103,1601069090,True,Still the one of the best fps games of all time. I always come back every year and replay this game just like I do with Half Life 2. This game doesn't even need a remake but that would be nice.
76561198138219989,1601061755,True,The legendary game is finally in my library. And what makes it better - it came in a full F.E.A.R. bundle. Now a have at least a weak of fun ahead of me...
76561198144382135,1601060479,True,"The DLC logs hours separately in Steam, but all told, I got about 30 hours out of FEAR, which can apparently ONLY be bought now in a package with DLC and FEAR 2 (GOG is a different story, I'm sure). At $11 on sale, what a steal, especially as it includes the FEAR 2 DLC which is hard to come by. 

FEAR is a much overlooked game of its era. I played it for the first time just a couple years ago and it was more engaging than any modern-day single-player shooter I've played. Without giving too much plot away, the game's atmospheric transition over the course of the game is handled superbly. Playing against the A.I. in this game will make you wonder why more modern shooters have not embraced A.I. design like this."
76561198041944087,1600930184,True,yeah its good. the scary stuff is whatever. the shooting is awesome.
76561199063040792,1600853738,True,Sadly F.E.A.R the oldest game in the franchise is the best game out of the three. This games evolutionary AI for 2005 still holds up today. Along with your character Pointman's slow-mo ability used for leaning from cover taking out multiple replica's while finding boosters to enhance your health and ability. Is quiet an enjoyable experience with a faint but noticeable story that is truly rich. To bad the next two games squander the story and gameplay by changing the original games mechanic's for a COD shooter with better graphics. All in all the F.E.A.R franchise is worth playing in full but the first game is by far the best with a little more disappointment in each entry after the original.
76561198060192727,1600789329,True,"F.E.A.R. Is a golden oldie as I'd call it, the gameplay is awesome with slow motion and limited enviromental damage which is cool for a 15 year old game. Straight up amazing AI they are so smart! It's a pitty AI in games nowadays are terrible when old games like these are just 10x better developed, must of been back when games developers were trying to make the best games on the market rather than who can make the best revenue lol 

Game is 10/10 a must play"
76561197989716933,1600709616,True,F.E.A.R has not aged a day since it's debut. With challenging gunfights and atmospheric horror elements it's still the definitive spooky shooter to play with a dynamic lighting system that some modern games would still kill for.
76561198144652346,1600699503,True,I'd recommend this game. Its definitely starting to show its age but still enjoyable to play through.

76561198127606812,1600227104,True,honestly one of the best shooters ever made
76561198086297500,1600216428,True,One of the best fps games still at 15 years old. There's not much to say that hasn't been said but this is an amazing experience from start to finish.

Even without great knowledge of it, I still did well and had a great time.  I could play this game over and over and still enjoy myself.  No bugs or game crashing glitches, however lights and dust clouds occasionally seem to have strange textures that expand further than they were supposed to.  All in all, I'd rate it very highly as one of my favorite horror FPSs, if not my ultimate favorite.  It's a shame about the sequels.

Edit to include reviews of DLCs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate:

Extraction Point offers more of what I loved about the base FEAR game and added a few extra fun bits as well, like slide-kicking doors open, new weapons and enemies, and just overall more FEAR.  The story is okay but the main draw of FEAR for me is the enemy AI and as ever, they are tactful and interesting.  I really am so distressed about the sequels still.

Perseus Mandate's story feels better, but the graphics somehow took a dip, which I don't mind at all.  More weapons and the quality-of-life improvements from the first game (i.e. slide kicking/punching doors open) are still there with a little extra to give it life away from just being a cash grab for the first game.  All-in-all, FEAR, Extraction Point, and Perseus Mandate are the greatest aspects of the FEAR Trilogy."

76561198195289958,1599312835,True,"JUMP TO SIDE #B# FOR SCORE AND SMALL REVIEW #A# IS THE MAIN REVIEW 

#A#
The first F.E.A.R Game was the best game's in it's lineup by far when I played it on back on  XB360 years ago and even recently, hell i even kept the console to just buy it again and play it on there, coming to PC it needed some work, like 1# low fps fix's, 2# small captions fix's (still not fixed on my end) and even just the 3# straight config of basic controller support through steam control config was needed to get this game to run ""optimally"". Even now 4# None Existent Rumble Support (this drives me up the wall) 5# studders during transitions between rooms (at 300fps or locked 60fps doesn't change this) are just some of the issues you will face when you try to play this game on ""modern"" hardware in 2020. Its def 5/10 on general ease of use/jump-in and play difficultly, you will def need to fix that fps issue coming into this game if your having it out of the gate, easiest way to see would be just run the game through a test run in settings and see if your dropping to 17 fps when you where 150-300 in the main menu, then hit up the guides section and install the patch it needs and ur good to go.

Gameplay wise though its a blast, unique enemies and there ways of attacking/flanking/retreating at and from you are something that will surprise you all the time, there almost ""thinking player level"" the ways they react to environment changes and your actions in combating them, they talk and communicate between each other (which can be fun to just listen to sometimes as you laugh in the shadows like the slowmoing madman you are) the FEAR to the situations your forcing them to get into is always a delight to play through, this unique gameplay is what makes fear ""special"" in it's maps/level design that is dynamic and sometimes even changing depending on the situations and combat going on in them to the point where you don't know after beating the game once where the enemies might pop up next, even though ill admit some events feel (knew that was coming) level sometimes in the story, its generally speaking a very fun game to play from my point of view and you will def enjoy it if games like (Fallout 3) are you bread and butter.

However I 100% wouldn't pay 50-60$ for the game collection at this point unless it got patched to all holy hell or (BY THE GODS) Remastered with some nice controller support, def a steam sale/cheap key buy for like 0-18 bucks for the collection and like 5-10 bucks for just the first game is as much as id be willing to throw at this in its current state on PC.


#B#


1# General ease of use is 6/10 it def needs some work popping in for the first time, prepare to visit the guides section if you have an issue with fps.

2# Gameplay is 9/10, its unique enemies are responsive & tactical in there ways of getting at you and how they move around the game environment, they communicate to each other in none-active and active combat which is unique to each map design and makes the game feel modern even in 2020. With unnerving shadowy dark areas that respond to the actions you take in them to the point where you can turn the tide of a fight just by tossing a well placed round or frag at some breakers to turn off the power in an area and cripple your enemies one by one hunting them down like a haunted house simulator. it really is something to behold and witness first hand

3# Price, I'd pick it up for a nice (5-10 bucks) for just the Fear1 standalone & the whole collection for (10-20 bucks) (I payed $11) but beyond that i wouldn't touch it beyond that price range, the repeatability just isn't there sadly, id say your looking to play this full play through style no more then once ever 2-3 months maybe, its a dust collector for sure but its fun to dust off and play every now and then.

Overall id give 7/10 for pc version & 9/10 for 360 console version."

76561198056185248,1598954744,True,"[h1]I was 7 when I first played this game. Yeah.[/h1]

Saying that this game had an impact on my life would be a bit of an understatement. This game and everything that happens in it was so unbelievable for my young brain that I would literally stick around some areas for [i]hours[/i]. Maybe it was literally fear (get it, FEAR?) that prevented me from just blasting through the game like some seasoned Quake 3 player, but I was in awe from this game.

Now I've decided to replay this game. And it was awesome.

I actually thought this game is quite long (like 7-8 hours), but my memory of most of the places and my experience in shooters helped me to get through all the encounters with ease on the Hard difficulty and literally speedrun it. No encounters lasted for more than 20-30 seconds because I would literally obliterate any enemy that was on my path. 
Of course, if you'll play this game first time, it won't be as short as it was for me.

[b]Summary:[/b] [i]This game is a very great mix of atmosphere, horror and insane action that lasts from the very beginning to the very end. Any gamer should at least give it a go, and any FPS fan should finish this game.[/i]
I really wish Monolith Productions could make a new FPS game. You have my reverence.

Expansions are something that I was interested in, but not as much as the base game. Timegate Studios has done a really good job with both Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, but they both have visible flaws.

[i]Extraction Point[/i] is, from a gameplay standpoint, a summary of the entire F.E.A.R. experience in a smaller package with a few additions to spice it up, like new weapons and gadgets. It even puts lots of effort into the horror sections, making them scarier! [spoiler]Holiday's death scene was literally the scariest and the most gruesome scene in my childhood, that's how I remembered this expansion.[/spoiler] 
The only beef I have with this expansion is a weak plot and a bad work on the voice acting. It reuses voice lines from the original game and adds little to the overall lore of the game, which is probably one of the reasons why Warner Bros. decided that this is not considered to be canon. 

[i]Perseus Mandate[/i] is interesting, because it tries to do something different and expand the lore a little bit, which I approve. But overall it's a weaker F.E.A.R. experience for several reasons:
- it puts more emphasis on action rather than horror and it lacks that F.E.A.R. atmosphere (I even had to tone down the brightess of the game to make it look closer to the original)
- it puts out a new faction of bad guys, Nightcrawlers, that aren't as interesting to fight against as Replica soldiers, and makes them the center of the campaign.
- new guns are underwhelming, especially the Nightcrawlers' main assault rifle.
- the plot still is as weak as the Extraction Point's, but at least it tries to add more to the lore.

You should try both of these expansions ONLY if you loved the original F.E.A.R. and want more."
76561197993272444,1598909683,True,"F.E.A.R. remains one of the greatest FPS of the past 20 years. The horror stuff was always the low point of the game and that's even more true now 15 years later since the whole world collectively  got over references to Ringu & Ju-on long ago. Still though, the combat feels just as good now as it did back in 2005. On higher difficulties the combat is fast, dangerous and exhilarating. The ridiculous amount of medkits you find means that the game is never really super hard as long as you remember to use them, even when playing on extreme, but the fact that any given encounter can take you from full health to dead in a matter of seconds feels really good."

Also the story is generic and the game isn't really scary despite being action ""horror"" and seeing the same little girl creeping on you gets old fast. I would recommend the Max Payne Trilogy over this game easily as the Max Payne games have more variety and much better looking scenery! It makes up for it's repetitiveness with it's amazing Ai and shooting and gunplay! No firefight and gun battle is the same! You can reload the same checkpoint and do the game firefights over and over and it will be at least slightly different each time! The multiplayer is completely dead and the story is not really anything special and that fat boy character sucks and is annoying. I'd recommend Max Payne 2 and 3 over this."

76561197987544964,1598208976,True,"F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) is a first-person shooter where you play as the Point-Man, the newest operative of the F.E.A.R. team, a unit that specializes in dealing with paranormal threats. A cannibal psionic named Paxton Fettel has somehow escaped from his cell in the secret headquarters of the large corporation Armacham, and telepathically taken command of an army of clone soldiers. It is up to you and your team to stop him and put an end to the threat. However, right from the get-go, you are plagued by disturbing visions of a little girl in a red dress, and you soon come to realise that there's more to Armacham than just your mission. 

This game originally came out in 2005, but make no mistake, this game rarely comes across as dated. Indeed, I will echo what countless others have said and say that the gameplay in this game is leagues ahead of many shooters coming out today. F.E.A.R. is an absolute blast through and through. What issues it does have in story is made up for with its sheer mastercraft in gunplay and level design. 

[h1] The Good	[/h1]

[list]
    [*][b] Intense, hard-hitting, badass, clever & stylish gunplay[/b]

The distinguishing feature of F.E.A.R. is its gunplay. Any battle in this game leaves the room in shambles; bullet decals litter the walls, props lay strewn across the floor, bloodied bodies pile in the corner. Combat is tense, fast-paced and always satisfying to take part in. And that's all before you use Slow-Mo. Slow-Mo allows you to slow the game down to a crawl and gain the upperhand over the enemy, as you take aim at a Replica soldier's head and watch the bullets slowly whistle through the air and impact his skull. On higher difficulties, this ability is essential as it allows you to properly react to the changing conditions of the battle without getting showered with bullets. Replica forces have insane reaction times and without Slow-Mo, the game plays out more like Counter-Strike in that skirmishes last mere seconds (which, if you prefer that kind of thing, is totally do-able as well). A good comparison is that the combat in F.E.A.R is John Woo meets The Matrix. 

I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention the excellent weaponry at the Point Man's disposal. Every single weapon is viable in this game, even the pistol that you start off with. Your arsenal is more of selecting which weapons you feel are the best for the situation, and the list is staggering. Conventional weapons like SMGs, shotguns and assault rifles are available for use, as are more experimental weapons like a rocket launcher that fires a barrage of rockets each shot, or a laser gun that literally rips the skin off enemies before turning them into a skeleton. All weapons sound great too, which adds to the impactful gunplay. 

    [*][b] Excellent level design and enemy AI	[/b]

The Replica forces in F.E.A.R. are no joke. They flank, provide cover fire, take cover if shot, knock over props for additional cover, throw grenades, and essentially do everything in their power to intelligently engage you. They constantly callout to each other depending on the condition of the batle, which greatly reminded me of the HECU in Half-Life 1 and adds a great deal of immersion to the game (nothing like hearing a Replica soldier scream ""SHIT"" in Slow-Mo as you toss a grenade at them). 

Of course, a large part in what makes these guys such an engaging enemy is the level design. Every battle is carefully constructed to ensure that the player has chance to take cover and assess the situation, but also gives the Replicas room to manuevre and flank you when given the chance. Thus, the combat is consistently engaging as you never know when a soldier is about to pop in right behind you. Indeed, there were multiple instances in my playthrough when a soldier (and not Alma) gave me a jumpscare when I checked behind me to see them bearing down. 


While this game is no Half-Life in terms of setpieces, there are a couple that are very well-done. These setpieces intertwine with F.E.A.R.'s core gameplay design very well, such as a sequence where multiple enemies are engaging you from elevators. 

    [*][b] Horror elements	[/b]

The horror elements in this game are done well (though some of the scares get old pretty quickly - see below). At the very least, you always feel like you're being watched or that a scare is right around the corner, even when it's not, due to the excellent sound design and atmospheric lighting. Contributing to the sense of unease are a couple of hallucinatory sequences that completely pull the rug underneath you.

[/list]

[h1] What needs improvement	[/h1]

[list]

   [*][b] Repetitive environments/levels [/b]

You will spend most of the game trudging through the same style of offices, factories and city streets. While the core gameplay keeps the game entertaining, I do wish we could have had more variety in the levels that we go through. The office section in the middle of the game in particular is prolonged and there really isn't anything to admire. 

    [*][b] Some horror elements[/b]

While the horror is generally well done, there are scares littered throughout the campaign that get old really quickly; you can only see a phantom figure walking across the screen with a loud radio feedback noise and get scared so many times before it becomes easily predictable. I'd say that overall F.E.A.R. is not a scary game at all, but rather tense & unsettling throughout. 

    [*]  Story retreads familiar and predictable ground (but is logical and keeps you invested) [b]

The story itself is very predictable. If you are the type of player that pays attention to all the audio logs throughout the game, you will be able to connect the dots as to what happens at the end very quickly. Even if you aren't the type to scour every corner for intel, a lot of events in the game are largely predictable. 

However, the story is told well, and everything that happens in the game does happen for a reason - I don't see any logic issues or contradictions. 

[h1] Final Thoughts	[/h1]

F.E.A.R. is a fantastic game that many will probably remember more for its excellent gameplay then its horror elements, although they both integrate to create a well-rounded horror/first-person shooter hybrid. Definitely recommend."

This game and Halo: CE singlehandedly ruined videogame AI. Not because it's bad mind you, but because there hasn't been anything as cleverly put together since. Not even exaggerating [i]that much[/i] either, [url=http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/gdc2006_orkin_jeff_fear.pdf]there's like an MIT paper on this crap[/url].

In case it isn't clear by now, you should really play F.E.A.R. There's some caveats to running this on modern systems, though:

[list]
    [*]You'll need to download and install the [url=https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/789-directinput-fps-fix/] DirectInput FPS Fix [/url]. Otherwise, the game will run like a slide show for whatever reason.
    [*]The FX anti-aliasing that comes with the game does [i]not[/i] work in conjunction with the soft shadows. I recommend forcing 4x MSAA through Nvidia Profile Inspector. If you don't know how to do that, check out [url=https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/F.E.A.R.#Anti-aliasing_.28AA.29]PC Gaming Wiki[/url].
    [*]For some reason, when you enter bullet time with an uncapped frame rate, there's way too much smoke on the screen. So just cap the game at your monitor's refresh rate through the Nvidia control panel or Profile Inspector. If you don't how to do that, that's cool.

    [*]Every now and then you'll see some flickering textures and some general odd stuff that doesn't look quite right.

Alright, so I *would* prefer to recommend this game, as its generally enjoyable.

That said...

On Win10 its practically unplayable without a vast amount of needless tedium in creating special files or trying to run other wrappers about it to get it to run in anything other than the base graphics resolutions, which generally creates a great deal of issues for those with more than one monitor. And even without +1 monitors, the micro-stuttering and graphical freezes during the game will result in massive amounts of needless deaths and frustration.

I'll end this by saying I don't remember having all these issues when I first played and beat it, so it's very possible something changed along the way."

76561198413482850,1597498794,True,Still holds up.
76561198004565778,1597471020,True,"I remember F.E.A.R. being lauded for its achievements back when I was in high school, and I never got the chance to play it until now. I can say with little doubt that age hasn't diminished its playability once you get everything working. 

Really the three main things you need to do to get the game to run pretty flawlessly are to check ""disable fullscreen optimization"" in the executable's properties, download a dll file to fix the framerate issues (which you can find on pcgamingwiki easily) and if the game still freezes randomly, you can force the game into windowed mode and have an app called Borderless Gaming fix that issue.

I couldn't find a way to get an xinput controller to work with the game, but there are a couple of controller configurations already made that are competent enough to work with the game. Only things to take note, if you want to walk without using aim or crouch, you'll need to map a separate button on the keyboard in the game's settings. You then go to the controller configuration's thumbstick map and make it so that the walk button is unpressed when the thumbstick is tilted all the way out to your liking. 

The other thing to take note when using a controller config: do not use Analog Emulation for this game. A rustling cloth sound plays the moment the game detects a movement input is pressed. Since Analog Emulation essentially presses the WASD buttons in a fast pulsing manner to make it seem like you're moving at different speeds, it will mean you will hear that sound effect played several times in succession because of it.

Anyway, even after 15 years, F.E.A.R. is still very fun, albeit repetitive. It wears its influences of John Woo and the Matrix pretty proudly all while having a very creepy atmosphere overlaying it. Definitely its weaknesses are the lack of varied environments and enemies, but it keeps things interesting with how enemies react in firefights depending on the level design as well as how you approach them. The AI in this game is very top notch, even today.

It's definitely worth looking into if you're a fan of shooters and horror."

76561198147082464,1597371149,False,"I'm going to be short and honest, I was not a fan of this game. I think the really high review rating of this game is attributed to a lot of people who played this back when it came out and are thus biased by a nostalgia factor, but 15 years later it's just not that good in my opinion.

F.E.A.R. puts you in the boots of Point Man, a member of the First Encounter Assault Recon team, who is designated to detain Alma Wade and Fettel, paranormal entities that have escaped their maximum security prison and begun to wreak havoc on the city. You have to go in, shoot your way through the hordes of soldiers that they have mind-controlled, and stop them. The game tries to be a horror-FPS, but ends up being an FPS-horror. There's a whole lot of shooting, and very little horror, and the horror that is there is the kind of stuff you'd find in a bad GMod Scary Map. Lots of low-tier jumpscares, moderately spooky atmospheres, and random bodies and blood flying from places they shouldn't be. I think the scariest thing in the whole game was the enemy type I like to call the Cloaker, cause they remind me of Cloakers from Payday 2. They're almost entirely invisible and completely silent, and the only thing they do is parkour everywhere and then run out of the shadows to bitchslap your shit. But while we're on the topic of AI, if there's one good thing to say about F.E.A.R. , it's that for a 2005 game the AI is surprisingly good. They're well-designed, they make call-outs to each other both to their and your advantage, they flush you out of hiding spots, they flank you, etc. Pretty solid. 

A TL;DR and some PROS/CONS-
PROS:
-Solid AI for a mid-2000s game
CONS:
-Repetitive gameplay
-Repetitive enemy types
-Lackluster horror elements
-Frustrating combat at times due to underdeveloped FPS mechanics (no ADS, no sprint, and more)
-Uninteresting story that becomes muddled throughout the game
-Unoptimized for modern computers and screens resulting in stretched resolution and reduced text size (apparently fixable with a community patch)

TL;DR If you don't have the nostalgia factor of already playing it back in the day, just don't bother. There's better horror games out there, there's better FPS's out there, and there's probably better horror-FPS's. 1/10"

Honestly incredible game, a masterpiece. The only complaints I have are the store pricing (look on another site like Fanatical or something for a key, I got mine for $2) and some issues with logitech mice, but there is a dll out there that fixes it. Just so fun, immersive, it feels good to play. Incredible, go buy it.

[h1]F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point[/h1]
A very solid expansion worth your time. I wouldn't call this a masterpiece like the base game, but it's just solid. The horror elements are much more in your face and over the top, on a few occasions coming off more humorous than scary, but on the whole it was well done. The brilliant lighting they did in the base game is mysteriously gone so it looks a bit dated and flat, but the environments they built are solid in this expansion.

[h1]F.E.A.R.: Perseus Mandate[/h1]
Just a really forgettable expansion. The lighting work was even worse than Extraction Point, making the whole thing look just terrible. The majority of this is just sequences of combat rooms with very little atmosphere or horror elements. It still has the same terrific combat system, so that carries this expansion, but on the whole just a lot worse than the rest of the content. If you really just want more of the combat, give this one a shot, but you aren't missing much if you skip out on playing this expansion."

Issue with frame dropping (however easily fixed with a outside patch)
Character models are a bit outdated (some worse than others) 
Music, while present, is scarce

Overall F.E.A.R. is one of the most unique and fun FPS's I have ever played and also one of the scariest horror games I have ever played (kids can be scary dude). I would wait for a sale however as this game, while fun, is not worth the $55 price tag.

76561198060322149,1596871236,True,"Very Realistic Shooter, even the player's shadows mimic the player reload and weapon switch animations. The Enemy Soldiers react to everything the PLAYER does to them and their squads. Whether the Soldier tells one of them to check out a noise, crawl under a large obstacle to manuever to a better position, reacts to the player's quick reflexes, flanking the player's position. So much more that adds to the realism of this game. 
The game contains horror and first person shooter action (without the horror), something rarely seen in media. A good example of this type of media mashup would be the film ""Predator"". The FPS action is a sort of ""relief"" from the horror you encounter in-game, since your human instinctual fear of the ""unknown supernatural"" is relieved with the human instinctual fearlessness of the known ""Man vs Man"" combat in regular non-horror fps. All in all this game did very well mixing Horror and Non-FPS horror in one title once."

I believe it was one of the first FPS games to make scripted events such a big portion of the gameplay and I admit whole-heartedly that it works."
76561198245409252,1596753953,True,"One of the best action games of all time. The AI is relentless and is one of the reasons F.E.A.R. is remembered for. The other being its fast and incredibly entertaining gameplay. All the weapons pack a punch, kick up dust, send paperwork and sparks flying across the room and leave enormous bullet holes in the sadly samey and bland environments; a point-blank shotgun blast will turn your foes into minced meat, a shot from the plasma rifle will burn replicas to a crisp and the rocket launcher will blow them into smithereens and it's all super fun to experience. The cherry on top is the added slo-mo mechanic which turns almost any section of the game into a scene from a John Woo film. 
The horror is hit or miss for me-sometimes it has a lot of buildup and tension and other times it's nothing but cheap and predictable jumpscares. 
However the story is the weakest link- its characters are mostly forgettable, the villains' motivations are illogical and it only servers as context for the already mixed horror.

A must-play for any fan of action FPS games. Just wait for a discount unless you want to buy the whole franchise for 60 euros."

[h1]F.E.A.R.[/h1]
If like way down the line, we learn that the programmers responsible for Rainbow Six Siege, came out and said ""Hey we based our movement off of F.E.A.R."" I'd honestly just not be surprised. This game moves like butter, or meat. Specifically how responsive Meatboy (or my dick) is. No delay, ability to tilt. MMF. 
Yo you know what's really good? Well made A.I. NPC's. This game has it, NOT LIKE CAW A DOODY. Dude, you can hide from the enemy A.I. They do call outs, if an A.I. gives to many call outs, other A.I will tell them to ""Shut the fuck up, He can hear you."" Mind boggling levels of immersion. A.I. will chuck grenades at where they think you are hiding, but line of site, and sound are very important. Moving between cover is important.
Scary games, can be lame sometimes, EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME IS 15 YEARS OLD, IT WILL SUBVERT YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF HORROR. Punishing your exploration, and item collecting with more dedicated scares than the mainline story.
Hand to hand combat is smooth, you can bust down doors with your melee, slide in and around the battlefield using the bullet time feature. God what a good game, I could beat my dick 5 times a day at how good this game is. 
The game used to be a computer melter, It still looks good, it still has just some amazing effects, and the first time you turn an A.I. into a mist of blood, it'll change something in you. Water still looks good, and the crazy part is, I'm pretty sure most of it is just high end filters. Also the lighting, sound, and music are all high quality.
BUT THE VOICE ACTING, OH GOD, MY PP HARD. Voice acting sounds more like a bunch of people actually experiencing what's going on. Super good.

BUT WHY CHARGE SO MUCH FOR A GAME WHERE THE MULTIPLAYER IS DEAD?!?!?!?!?!

Price is terrible, and multiplayer is dead (and removed).
But this game is still fucking amazing 15 years later, absolutely get it, play it, and if you don't enjoy it.

AI is smart. They react to you, your movements, sounds, flashlight. AI communicates with each other effectively, and uses the environment/cover to their advantage.

Shooting mechanics are above average, aided by the slow motion effect (which also makes for some pretty brutal death splatters). What I don't remember from 15 years ago, though, when I first played this game, was how overdone the rag doll physics are. It can be immersion breaking.

Dynamic lighting is fantastic and one of the main highlights of the game.

The game does a really good job at mixing up combat with jump scares (not cheap ones, though) and suspenseful sections. Much of the game will be spent playing with chills running up your neck. The dynamic lighting (again, fantastic for its time and holds up really, really well) and music tone adds to this.

This game (and the two standalones, and FEAR 2) are so good in my book that they definitely warrant multiple playthroughs. The gameplay, while the game definitely looks dated, still holds up like some more modern FPS titles. It's a well-balanced mix between FPS and horror-survival. Enemy encounters feel natural, and become noticeably more challenging as the game goes on. The gunplay is balanced and offers a level of variety in how you approach fights, especially with the added slow-motion feature, adding new opportunities to bring down enemies.
The story is definitely somewhere in the middle, but leaves a lot of open ends to expand upon. Granted, it's easy to lose yourself in the frantic gunplay and dark, isolated corridors than it is to pay attention to the story.
Overall, this is definitely a title for FPS fans looking for something a little more out of their games, fighting in cramped corridors and confined spaces, often against enemies that have some kind of special ability. Is it worth full-price? Maybe. It's pretty good, but unless you're getting it in the bundle (which includes the two standalone expansions), it's probably not worth full-price. Is it worth it on sale?

Lots of nice jump scares too. 

Really do recommend if you're feeling nostalgic. 

8/10 for shooters of its age."
76561198004540262,1596056156,True,This game rules
76561198028984862,1595980237,True,"F.E.A.R. was one of those strange games that came about at a time when the survival-horror genre was not quite mainstream and FPS games dominated the new release shelves. Overall, though, the game is something of a rare anomaly. The horror elements are mostly just a few jump-scares and horrifying images, but there's some kind of subtle secret sauce to this game that makes me come back even a decade after its release. 

The secret to this game is three-fold. First, you have atmosphere. The environments are dimly lit, but not in the manner like ""Doom 3"", which came out around the same time. The low-light in environments that are usually brightly lit in everyday life brings a certain creepiness, The mundane-ness of the environments also plays to the game's strength of atmosphere. The intense moments are actually intense (more than I can say for some games) and the quiet moments of the game bring out this sense of impending dread. That feeling of dread is the key. It keeps you on edge. 

Second, the mystery in the story. Obviously, I won't get into spoilers, but this game has a definite mystery on the initial play-through. You discover things in a very natural feeling way as you traverse the levels. You run into NPC's that actually have goals and purpose. All this gives you a sense that there's something big going on, but doesn't give away its hand until the climax. Even then, it leaves a lot of provocative question marks at the end. 

Third, my personal favorite, the AI. I've been gaming for decades now and of all the games I've played, this one does enemy AI right. Better yet, it does it in a way that no other game has ever matched since. The AI in this game actually use tactics and will keep you on your toes constantly. They react in a way that seems natural. They actually seem to register a bullet hit with legit feeling. A leg shot will make them stagger. Enemies use cover while others use cover-fire in realistic ways. In close proximity, they're almost impossible to take at hand-to-hand. Overall, the challenge these AI soldiers pose, even on Easy difficulty, is outright staggering. It actually makes the game legitimately challenging to play. You can't go into this game with a ""spray-and-pray"" mentality. 

I have a couple minor nit-picks. One, the only annoying thing about the AI is that they do tend to be either able to spot your reflection off a soda can in the corner of a room and send guys after you, or they won't see you standing three feet away in a lit corner until you start shooting. So, the actual sensory aspects of the AI do lag a bit in that department, but it does add to the game's charm. 

Two, the game does sometimes bug and cause items or characters to become glued half-in-half-out of walls or surfaces. This is so rare, though, that its not a major detraction. 

Third, the lack of any HD optimization is a bit of a bust. Best it can render on my computer (which I'm running an MSI Duke 1080 Ti and Ryzen 7 CPU in a custom built gaming rig) is 1600x1200 pixels. It doesn't affect the graphics too much, but a good 1080p optimization at the least would be nice. 

The bottom line, this was and still is a great game. It broke a lot of the rules for FPS games of the time and did it in a rewarding way. This one is still a huge favorite for me and my brother all these years later. We still reference the ""Cheezy Pooz"" snacks and goofy homages to ""Office Space"" here and there. There are some minor comedic elements, but they don't beat you over the head. A solid game, from top to bottom. Get it. Yes, the game has aged, but it's aged gracefully for how old it is."

76561198421049335,1595957871,True,"This is my favorite horror game ever created (and I have played quite a few ranging from Verde Station, Resident Evil, Layers of Fear, The Evil Within, Betrayer, and Penumbra to Lost in Vivo, Condemned, Alan Wake, and beyond). I've completed every game in the series (except 3) at least twice. I absolutely love the series' main storyline, the background lore, the settings you explore in the game, the mechanics, and the enemy AI. The main story is complex and complicated and will likely take some independent research and thinking if you want to grasp the full story of what exactly is going on and why (much beyond playing the games). The background lore (who gets involved, where they are, what they're doing, and why all this is happening is fascinating in much the same way and I highly recommend researching it in addition to the main story. The settings you explore range from warehouses, military installations, secretive government labs where malicious experiments were performed, office buildings, and destroyed city streets later on in the series. They are all executed very well and capture the feelings of isolation and insecurity very well...anything could be around the next corner and the game ensures you do not forget that throughout. The mechanics are remarkably well done, the gunplay is fluid and the use of bullet time (slow motion) is very enjoyable to use. The enemy AI is incredibly impressive to this day. These are not your average call of duty enemies that will try to strafe you and run out in the open. The enemy AI in this game is cohesive, they use cover, they use explosives to flush you out, they act as a unit. Beyond that, even this game's lighting is incredibly well done. The first installment in the series was released in 2005 but it doesn't look that bad graphically because, in large part, to the lighting. It is semi-dynamic and gives most areas the perfect ambiance. This series is fantastic and, in my humble opinion, is worth every cent of full price, it is creepy, the gameplay is fun and rather unique, and the story is exceptional. All of the games in this series are definitely worth a buy for horror fans...except three, stay far far away from F.E.A.R. 3."

76561197998810023,1595712514,True,Fun FPS game. It shows its age in graphics and gameplay but still enjoyable.  Story is mildly interesting not too deep.  Reminds me of half life 1 in its older style of run and gun gameplay.
76561198041453907,1595708928,True,"I'm very inexperienced and lazy when it comes to leaving long reviews, so I'll just say this is one of the best FPS games ever made. Playing video games since about 1991, nothing has surpassed the immersion, atmosphere, and entertainment this game bestows."
76561198101160818,1595688888,True,Scary!
76561197997336036,1595619906,True,"UPDATE: 

After trying out the DLL fix I have to say it fixes the FPS issue. 
I will change the recommend to YES but do have in mind that the physics does get a bit buggy at times when peaking at 600-1000fps. Maybe limiting the frames to 100-144fps would help this, uncertain if it would but I would recommend looking over it.
I've so far seen ragdolls getting very glitchy and I even manage to get stuck inside a door after just couple of minutes of gameplay ;D




F.E.A.R is a great game but I highly recommend you stay away from this game until they fix the issues it is having.

Runs extremely poorly because of software related issues(Sub 30fps)

In-order to fix the issue you will have to uninstall certain software which might affect it such as Logitech software, Razer softare and so on, atleast this is what I've found is the cause of the frequent crashes and fps drops. 

So it's either a poorly coded game, or they havent looked over this game for a while and the out-come is that the game is unplayable. In order to complete the game in todays time is rebooting it every 5-10 minute to remove the fps-drop which will then come back. 

Sad over this since this game was such a masterpiece when it came out and still out perform the newer titles by a mile, sure it might not look as good, but just how the AI and story was put together was sure a game I will forever remember.

Stay away until they fix the issue."
76561197991304497,1595489179,True,A very good pc game with an amazing A.I and combate full of detail and cool effects. The best action shooter with horror elements.

76561198312478485,1595469897,True,"Summary:
	I’m still not sure where I stand 100% on F.E.A.R. Personally I enjoyed it and thought is was a great experience with the horror/fps genre, however I cannot say for sure if I would recommend the game. First, of all Steam does not even let you purchase the first title independently and instead drags the price up by only selling it with the series’ bundle. Second, my time with F.E.A.R was not all good, in fact it ended abruptly with a game breaking bug that told me to start over or give up, and despite all the fun I had I did not want to hit rewind just yet and play all through it again. Last, I am afraid most players looking for a horror/fps simply have better options: Resident Evil, Dead Space, and many zombie games are probably better; Resident Evil looks way more composed for a horror game and Dead Space looks as if it’s just a better game and has a much stronger following. If you are interested in F.E.A.R I would recommend trying the first game on GOG since it can be bought independently and for much less than the Steam bundle.

Audience
	A great FPS shooter; personally I categorize F.E.A.R as an atmospheric single player FPS beside games like Bioshock and Halo. This is a mature adrenaline filled experience teenagers and adults can love, filled with blood, gore, guns, bullets, and action movie effects that embody testosterone: Slow motion effects, explosions of debris and gore, massive guns firing rockets, lasers, or a flurry shotgun shells; everything this game does is for those looking for a unique mature FPS experience.

Graphics
	This isn’t the prettiest game, even for it’s time. Games like like Star Wars Republic Commandos, Star Wars Battlefront II, Resident Evil Four, Shadow of the Colossus, Halo 2, Metroid Prime, Monster Hunter, Prince of Persia all came out the same year or earlier. However, what it may lack in style or in overall textures it makes up for in stunning effects. Environmental effects, the way the bodies of enemies react to various ammo types is great. On a technical level its better than a lot of games I’ve played. The greatest drawback is the visuals look average, a lot worse than the good and a lot better than the bad.


Sound
	The sound design carries this game. I can’t say much for the music it’s not Halo and it’s definitely not bad. The focus here was on ambiance and it pays off massively. The static of you UI to kicking around cans as you explore the levels. The clones’ voice actor carrying half the game and what makes your foes so impactful Even Alma’s occasional giggle all is handled well and while I may know squat about sound direction I know this shit sounds good to the player and that's all that matters.


Difficulty
I only played on normal and I only died to stupid personal mistakes. There's an abundance of healing items, armor, and ammo. The game doesn't throw you any wild curveballs, a few scares, heavy armored mechs jumping through walls, but nothing to crazy. The difficulty is not forced and is paced well through the game, steadily introducing more enemies and scenarios. It is not too difficult, more expierenced fps players should go with hard, less with normal, and people who don't play games should go to easy.

Story
F.E.A.R isn’t a story heavy game, not like the RPG’s I usually play are at least. F.E.A.R likes to address some interesting themes like corporatism, ideas like humans meddling with powers beyond their control, technology evolving faster than morality, etc. Most are touched briefly or are not directly addressed by the narrative but can be seen while playing the game and doing some exploring into the world and reasons behind all the madness. For what’s there it works and is quite interesting and pleasant, especially the narrative’s way of keeping the player in the dark, we all know mostly what happened but not the details and it’s a great motive the game uses. 


Bugs
I planned on beating this game, however I had to stop earlier because the game, got bugged. It was a pretty common bug to, and fairly odd. I was disconnected from the server...on my single player, offline, story oriented session...except its not a session its just a game save. The issue is centered around a loading issue with the graphics and I’m assuming a bug with the engine. From what I found there was no “end all be all” fix, just some situational fixes of which all failed to work for me. 

Game time / Length
From what I’ve seen and heard its roughly 9-10 hours however I was estimating my run would’ve ended at about 8. I had to stop earlier because the bug, but from what I got I felt the game was a little longer than needed or could at least have been compacted or spread better. It wasn't entirely too long, more of it felt awkward as a player. A mix of too much mindless gun fights towards the end and not enough exploring dedicated towards small scares or world building. The pacing was overall good, but I will gripe that I wished the combat was broken up with more horror segments or at least some more exploration dedicated to finding phones, laptops, or gory scenes left to our imagination; but that’s more of a personal gripe, because I think most players wouldnt have minded even more gunfights to bulk the game.

Price / Quality
It’s a great game and I haven’t experienced many titles like it, although I’m just now trying to branch out into horror (specifically in this past year). Overall, it was very fun and that’s a good word for F.E.A.R, because it isn’t meant to be deep, or incredibly terrifying. At the end of the day it was a game, that was a blast to play up till its end, game play and all.
Now for the price: I couldn't find F.E.A.R’s individual price and tbh I bought the bundle so there’s that. But the game on Good Ol’ Games (GOG) is a nice 9.99 us $ and on sale is 2.49$ which is above and beyond worth it. 
For me personally F.E.A.R is gonna stick and I cannot wait to come back and try it again once the disappointment about my bugged play through leaves my system. For roughly 10 hours for a play through, roughly a buck per hour it’s actually pretty good, think about all you can take away from it and enjoy, and if it leaves you wanting more another play through should be very rewarding."
76561198029094011,1595453912,True,"A really cool action horror game, A.I. can be derpy sometimes but for the most part its impressive how they flank you and give callouts to one another. multiplayer doesnt seem to work."

The horror aspect was very well done, without a lot of use of jumpscares, but more subtle spooks. Story was also really interesting. Overall, this game was a good time and do recommend to play it."
76561198120135255,1595329011,True,"[h1] Introduction [/h1]
What is F.E.A.R based on? Who is our protagonist? What is our purpose?
It is complicated to explain the story of F.E.A.R because it is very subjective, You can either relate it to the protagonist or the main antagonist known as Alma Wade, I'll try my best to cover both point of view

F.E.A.R. is supposedly based on a real life story (partially) and the events of the game are seen entirely through the eyes of the protagonist known simply as Point Man, We are part of a special force called F.E.A.R (First Encounter Assault Recon) team, we are selected on the basis of our unnatural reflexes and other talents our very first assignment is to contain a threat posed by an unknown militant group which has now taken over Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) which created them in the first place, our job is to neutralize the threat but soon we find out about many interesting secrets about our past and identity and thus begins our journey in the world of F.E.A.R, I won't say anything more because any other info will just spoil the game for you so I'll conclude the introduction section here

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
F.E.A.R runs on Monolith's Lithtech engine and offers a unique gameplay in terms of weaponry and other techniques you can use in battle
Every weapon serves a purpose in the game, some weapons are effective against certain enemy types while some weapons are practically useless against a certain enemy type. You also have the ability to enable slowmo to get past the enemies and land a critical blow, there are also health and reflex upgrades throughout the game to allow you to increase your health and reflex boost permanently and if your gameplay is more on the exploration side you'll be rewarded for exploring the game 9/10 times which makes the search satisfying

Another good aspect of F.E.A.R is the weapon balance and enemy Artificial Intelligence, the enemies are not bullet sponges and neither easy bugs to squash you can't just rush and shoot your way through the game, you require strategy to move from point A to point B and furthermore the enemy AI doesn't make it easy for you they coordinate with each other and even force you to leave your hiding spot by either strategically throwing a grenade or by  flanking you, THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO CHARGE AT YOU AND DIE KEEP THAT IN MIND, I have played many games and saw many great examples of AI and F.E.A.R has one of the best AI in video games I've come across in my 18 years of playing video games

The music composed for this game is also a work of art and it really sets the mood, also the implementation of physics also amazed me the game felt very realistic and smooth to play.

[h1] Modding / Addons [/h1]
When it comes to modding, I actually didn't use any mods to play this game but before writing this review I searched for mods and there aren't a lot of mods for this game but in my opinion this game is worth it even without mods, you can enjoy the game without mods so its not a big issue.

[h1] Problems / Issues [/h1]
The problems I came across after downloading and launching F.E.A.R are few but can be fixed
such as,
[list]
[*]FPS drops
[*]No option for higher resolution
[*]No official updates to optimize the game for modern computers
[*]You can't buy F.E.A.R and its DLCs separately (you have to buy the complete pack)
[/list]

There was a simple fix for the resolution problem and FPS drops, I downloaded an unofficial patch and that fixed the game for me, you just have to search either the community section of the game or google it BUT IT IS EASY TO FIX THE GAME AND IT IS WORTH IT

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
+Great gameplay
+Great soundtracks
+Great physics implementation 
+Great Story
+Weapon balance
+Satisfying battles with enemies 
+Great AI
+Variety of weapons
+Mod Support

-FPS Drops
-No support for higher resolutions after 1024 x 768
-No official updates for optimizing the game
-Cannot be purchased separately from complete pack
(Most of the issues can be fixed with a patch)

[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]
F.E.A.R offers a fun gameplay and stood the test of time, it has aged unsurprisingly well most of the game mechanics hold up to this day 15 years later (as of writing this) , Its worth the price as well (if you buy the game on sale) 

Despite all the problems I still recommend this game it is definitely worth buying but please buy it on sale and save your cash its not worth paying $60 for complete pack I got this for around $14 (complete pack)
So go ahead and buy it and have fun

76561198049745680,1595033747,False,"TL;DR: AMAZING GAME, DO NOT GET IT ON STEAM.

F.E.A.R. is a masterpiece in first person combat, which it manages to blend with horror elements exceedingly well. The environments make excellent use of dynamic lighting, and harsh shadowsa, and the enemy AI in the first game is some of the best in any game I've ever played.

Gunfights are hectic affairs. the enemies will try to flank and catch you off guard. The loud, bassy sound of gunfire echoes through the halls. When it's over, all that remains is dead clones and environmental objects scattered about the area in the chaos. The environments never look the same after a gunfight is over. The bullet time mechanic elevates all these other elements, and puts the visual spectacle at the forefront. You'll watch the trails of bullets flying past you, you'll watch enemies fly back or in slow motion after you blast them with a shotgun, you'll watch the shock waves of grenades as they explode enemies to bloody chunks, and send environmental objects flying all over the place. The sections between combat are great too. This game is atmospheric as hell. Nothing in this game is pants-shittingly terrifying, but the horror sections do a great job at keeping tension present between combat scenarios, and holding your interest throughout the game's run time, which is all they really need to do anyway. 

I genuinely cannot praise F.E.A.R. enough, and if you're a fan of First Person Shooters, then this title is a must-play.

All that being said, i can't in good conscience recommend buying this game on Steam. The only way to buy the game on this platform is in a $60 package deal with the rest of the titles in the series. All of which suck donkey dick, if you'll pardon my language. As good as this game is, i can't justify a $60 price tag on a 15 year old game.

Worry not though, you can get F.E.A.R. on GOG with both of it's expansion packs for $10. Go there instead of wasting $60 to get a good game from 2005, packaged with 2 shitty games that you'll never play."
76561198064114664,1594983418,True,One of the greatest FPS games of all time with Japanese horror elements. A testament to its quality that it still holds up in 2020. Highly recommended!
76561198181735102,1594938524,True,Game made me paranoid of climbing ladders.
76561198090358980,1594896161,True,"Made a great debut to the series, the physics system is really surprising for a FPS, the interactive part doesn't reach the height of Half-Life 2 but the particle system really does. Just few minutes of gameplay, I felt this game stunning even after i finished Dead Space 2 on other platforms, it features both thrilling vibe and jump-scare graphics. 
A little bit shame that EAX Sound Effects can't be enabled on modern hardware, this option is strictly limited to certain Sound Cards & Legacy Windows OS, really picky for an old game.
Also I heard the Multiplayer mode F.e.a.r Combat has been revived, so the standalone community-patched version is worth trying too."
76561197996079479,1594843549,True,"Fear 1 & Extraction Point are fantastic, Fear 2 is ok, Fear 3 and Perseus Mandate are  forgetable. 

Fear 1 is 15 years old and still an absolute (terrifying) joy to play: it's scary as hell and the AI and gameplay would put some current FPSs to shame. OK, there's not a tonne of different enemies, but they're well done, and there is just enough story to keep you going. Sound effects are excellent, and the graphics, while definitely dated, are actually damn good if you take the game's age into account. Excellent game to get the heart rate up."
76561198295596524,1594813355,True,10/10. An absolute classic but I would recommend purchasing fear platinum on gog for $9.99 instead of the price gouging series bundle on steam. I got lucky and found the the fear complete pack for 10ish bucks through humble bundle but otherwise steer clear.
76561198128980217,1594793784,True,"One of the all time greatest Fps horror titles. No idea why this isn't sold by itself or not backwards compatible on the xbox one. I guess they just figured no one would buy FEAR 2 & 3 otherwise. Very atmospheric campaign with wonderful combat with a few odd glitches and annoyances. Sometimes enemies will continue to shoot and hit you after they kill you, and sometimes they will hit you through a wall. Unless you play on higher difficulties, these are very minor flaws. The game doesn't have much variety in the enemies but the pacing and level design is well thought out. I love the grounded and dark environments.  One of my favorite games ever!"

F.E.A.R. is a 00's style FPS with everything that it entails. It tends to go for the semi-realistic (black ops) side of the FPS spectrum and has heavy horror elements.

It's an incredible game, famous for its gunplay, sound design, horror immersion and especially its AI that behaves in incredibly human ways.

Its plot may seem all over the place sometimes borrowing elements of Japanese horror, military high-stakes and overabundance of the ""blood-everywhere"" and ""it's-dark"" horror tropes, but these only end up serving the game's vision pretty well.

76561198132792574,1594396046,True,"F.E.A.R. is apparently a very influential and beloved FPS from the mid-2000s, and considering the state of shooters at that point in time, I kinda get how such a completely mediocre game with a few distinguishing features could be rocketed up to classic status. To be clear, it's not bad; the gameplay is pretty cool, and capably does what it sets out to do. But it's not good enough to prop up the insipid, edgy story or boring presentation, and only just barely manages to hold up for the game's entire excessive length. As a result, the whole package is just fine; nothing special, nothing abhorrent.

F.E.A.R. purports to be a horror game, but it's the lowest-effort horror imaginable: flickering lights, moving objects, gory corpses and pools of blood, screams and sounds of crying babies, musical stings, flashing images onscreen, disappearing apparitions, obvious hallucination sequences, a spooky little girl with long hair in front of her eyes and a ruined dress, just all the hits. The annoying thing is how well it works a lot of the time; when paired with the first-person camera, it creates a fairly tense atmosphere for the game—at least, it is when they remember to do it, as opposed to when they ignore that aspect of the game for a few hours in favor of just doing gunfights in well-lit spaces (these are the best parts of the game). In any case, it's just annoying, and feels artificial and forced a lot of the time.

The plot is similarly unfun. It's essentially a compilation of as many edgy events and Deep-State conspiracy tropes as humanly possible, with an excuse tacked on as almost an afterthought for why the gameplay should be based around gunfights. The characters are one-note and impossible to care about. It's just not interesting to learn about or satisfying to watch unfold; instead, you just find yourself waiting for it to be over so you can get to the next gameplay segment.

Other aspects of the presentation aren't much better. Apparently the game was considered great-looking at the time of release, which I simply refuse to believe. I guess it has a lot of graphical bells and whistles, like sparks and bullet decals, but the game overall is very unappealing to look at. It's nothing but brown and black and gray, with extremely boring urban-decay and industrial environments only occasionally broken up by a tastefully decorated office space or something. The only high points are the solid weapon feel and the out-of-place-but-quite-welcome silly gore, but those are both gameplay-related enough that I'm willing to stick to the statement that the gameplay is the only good thing about the game.

It is pretty good, though. F.E.A.R. is a tactical FPS through and through, with a dedication to tension and spur-of-the-moment thinking that's pretty admirable. The central mechanic is slo-mo, which is always fun; it helps with all the things that slo-mo normally does in a shooter, encourages mid-shootout prioritization and planning, and regenerates pretty goddamn quickly, allowing it to be a major part of how you play the game. The other big selling point of the game is its much-lauded AI, which is legitimately impressive even today: enemies use alternate routes to sneak up on you, notice your flashlight, tactically retreat, flush you out with grenades, pin you down, get around obstacles, and just generally fuck with you in very human ways. The endlessly abusable slo-mo means that this often doesn't amount to much, unless the game throws ten of them at you and they have a good flanking route, but it's cool to see it all play out either way. The real threat comes from the game's fancier enemies, which tend to absorb stupid amounts of damage and kill you in seconds. They're more frustrating and less fun, but luckily pretty rare.

Overall, combat feels appropriately tense and tactical, mostly due to enemy health and damage being a bit high, so good job there; it's not always fun, exactly, but it's always involving. It's helped by lots of small touches, such as the aforementioned good weapon feel and gore, as well as little upgrade syringes that don't do a whole lot but feel rewarding to collect. However, it does wear a bit thin over the course of the game's runtime, which is a few hours too long, and when the game takes its final plot turn in the last couple levels it gets straight-up annoying, like everything else. 

So yeah, F.E.A.R. is a cool mechanical exercise [strike] if [/strike] and nothing else. If you feel like you'd enjoy a tense tactical shooter with liberal use of slo-mo, this does a pretty good job of being that. If you want a cool horror experience, or an engrossing story, or an atmospheric journey, this is none of those, despite its best efforts. I give it the most tepid recommendation I can give, unless you're interested in game history, in which case I recommend it slightly more than that."

I would want a game where you are point man and at least the events of FEAR one already happened. Then you are tasked with fighting another supernatural thing not just things related to Alma. This could be fighting a wierd ""satanist"" organization that summoned a demon or something. I just think this universe has so much more to give."

76561198010665934,1594251547,True,An instant classic title that still manages to outdo modern FPS games with it's AI enemies and scares. Just make sure to turn off the steam overlay before launching the game as it causes the game to not start on Windows 7 and get the fix in the forum threads as well.

76561197978840194,1594186525,True,A very solid shooter. Has a well deserved reputation for solid AI. The lighting and atmosphere in the levels is top notch however it doesn't quite get there with the horror aspect which relies a ton on jump scares and is nowhere near subtle enough to make you feel true dread.
76561198156988985,1594098132,True,One of my favorite games of all time. Holds up well today and I go back to it each year for a quick campaign run.

76561198006259150,1593928288,True,"Yeah, the graphics haven't aged well and the horror elements are fairly tame compared to something like the Dead Space or Resident Evil franchises, but as shooters go, you can't get much better than F.E.A.R. The Rakow assault rifle has to be one of the most fun weapons in any FPS ever, and the dynamic lighting, destructible environments and particle effects make F.E.A.R a god among shooters. The icing on the cake is the enemy AI. Replica soldiers aren't dumb grunts who will charge blindly into a hail of gunfire, or stare slack-jawed at the grenade you've just tossed at their feet until it splatters them all over the nearest wall. They are smart, coordinated, understand suppressing fire, cover and flanking, and will punish you mercilessly for your carelessness. You underestimate them at your peril.

If you're after a legendary FPS with some interesting horror elements, a variety of entertaining weapons, an intriguing story, challenging enemies, and some truly epic set-piece fire-fights, F.E.A.R fits the bill admirably. What's more, you can run it on a toaster and it plays nice with Linux. Highly recommended."

76561197996644633,1593876601,False,"A once great title with plenty of scares but has aged poorly.

Given the age (15yrs+) revisiting this title is disappointing, lighting is a high contrast bring pitch black corners but blinding white flash lights.

The price is just bad, OUT RIGHT CRIMINAL.

Avoid this title."

The only thing that was enjoyable throughout the boring gunplay was the bullet time ability which added hilarious ragdolls. 
The jump scares were all predictable and never did much to keep me from advancing cautiously, in fact it was not scary at all unless little girls somehow still scare you. 
The music was decent at times.
I did not try it on the highest difficulty which was probably the reason I breezed through this game in under 5 hours.
I wish I played this when it first came out. 
If you were to play it now I would recommend playing on the hardest difficulty."

You feel hunted the entire game as you hunt your way towards your targets, and the abundance of SFOD-D Operators who are not equipped to deal with the paranormal threat like you (Point Man, the protagonist and lead operative of the First Encounter Assault Recon team) are. The only issue is that there are two timelines for after this game - the Vivendi games  (Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate) and the Monolith ones (F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin and F.E.A.R. 3 - I personally prefer the latter but EP is very fun.

I'd definitely recommend buying this."
76561197965886605,1593608200,True,"I love this game. There's a creepy atmosphere that i would compare to the Japanese Horror movies that i love and a character that will remind many of Sadako/Samara from Ringu/ The Ring.  The graphics, sound and firefights in my opinion were top of the line when this game first arrived and they hold up pretty well. I don't want to spoil too much but give this series a shot."
76561198190006102,1593576208,True,"Alright, I just have to stop playing the game for a moment and say this is one of the best FPS games I have ever played in my life.
With many FPS games in early years, the characters face would appear either on the HUD or in a short intro cinematic. You could hear the occasional grunt when taking damage. In F.E.A.R you don't know the person your taking control of, you don't know what he or she sounds like, we aren't given any backstory as to why he or she is a Covert Special Forces soldier, all the reveals of the unknown soldiers identity and backstory is not included because Monolith want to make you feel as though your that soldier. YOU are the one causing destruction, YOU are the one who is responsible for the task given, YOU are the badass, everything is YOU in this game.
Kills when using the bullet-time mechanic are extremely satisfying and funny on occasions, when throwing a grenade into 3-4 enemies, they'll get ripped apart by the impact or comically ragdoll in the air until you finish them off with that one last shotgun blast to the face or body, adding extra immersion to this is assisted by a swaying camera depending on how close you are to the grenade and static vision on different angles of the camera. This has all been implemented perfectly and is something you don't really see anymore in games.
The little girl who incessantly appears throughout the game is pretty scary the first few times but then becomes a bit old the more you see it, still it does fit in really well with the games setting.
The horror theme isn't the type that tries to jump scare you every chance it gets, more so it tires to mess with your mind. You will see horrific imagery of faces that pop up at times, walk down a straight corridor or open room towards screams of agony, trying to get past fire and avoiding black figures that attack you. It's almost like whenever some of these visions occur your in the exact same room but in a different world. Weird but brilliant stuff.

F.E.A.R really does stand the test of time and I would highly recommend this for anyone into First-Person Shooters or just games in general. In fact it's one of those games you really should play at least once before you die.
Monolith are responsible for Shogo, No One Lives Forever, Condemned: Criminal Origins and the timeless BLOOD games. I would highly recommend checking BLOOD out.
You really get the feeling Monolith had a lot of fun making this and put a substantial amount of effort into it.
I give this game a 10/10!!

It won't scare you if you're into horror games but it will give you the shivers from time to time. That is unless you're easily scared, then yea, you might have a tough time. It's a shooter with psychological horror themes sprinkled on top. I am not really into horror games (because most of them are walking simulators with arse gameplay) the combat and good AI pulled me through. The story doesn't even seem to be the focus, it's the shooting and level navigation that I really enjoyed. Although the story is somewhat compelling and keeps you interested. Not too much dialogue to bore you and not too little to make the universe feel empty.

- Decent graphic with impressive technical lighting, shadow, particle, reflection and physic to backup the experience.

- It physically has fully realized character in an fps game (Look at your legs, look at your reflection, look at your shadow, look how silly they are when they kick, but its one of the thing for me that sells the immersive experience).
- Creepy atmosphere (Strange event, flickering lights, approaching footstep, ominous sound until you realized you just kick a can of soda).
- Game's re-playable (give this game another year or so and you'll be back to relive another moment of fps genre).

Looking across the city skyline at the flat bitmap scenery will make you think you've traveled back to the early 2000s.  And in a way, you have.  This game came out in 2007.  So this is to be expected.  However, don't let that stop you from enjoying this game.  I have replayed it many times and enjoy every play-though,  even now in 2020.  It really is a legendary game.  One thing people may not like is that you can't ADS on most of the weapons.  It only just zooms you.  But this really isn't that big of a deal and since most of the combat is focused on CQB.  If you are a fan of FPS games you will enjoy this game, as long as you realize that you are buying a game from 2007 and understand you are getting an experience from that era."

[spoiler]  Roaming around in the ATC building seeing a lot of the staff and security decimated from the replicas made me feel bad for them at first, but later through out the game you learn that ATC is another one of those evil corporations doing shady stuff and killing anyone who might get a glimpse of it.

While there's 4K support, the game has aged a lot and really could have used a bit of remastering.   The key problem is that the game isn't optimised well for modern systems so you get punishingly bad framerates and memory leak issues that make the game far too much of a hassle to play.

76561198009350989,1591545224,True,"A spooky game with superb shooting gameplay.
For an old game the graphics and general aesthetic still holds up, in a large part to the dynamic lighting which still looks great to this day.
The firefights are enjoyable and are held up by the enemies reactions to the player and their actions. Enemies call out their positions and their tactics, which allows for the player to react and adjust accordingly. The slow motion mechanic is satisfying to use and creates humorous moments where an enemy may ragdoll crazily when killed in slow motion. The player slide kick and flying kick are amazing to pull off in slow motion. Honestly, I'd probably replay the game again in a large part to the firefights, it's just fun to play.
There are horror elements and most sections are quartered off into spooky segments and firefight segments. There are some pretty good scares in there, but of course, you still have a gun so you have little to worry about."

[h1] I used to own a boxed version of F.E.A.R. but was too scared to play this game [/h1]

When it came out, I really wanted to like this game but… I was too afraid to play it. The game came out in 2005 and I was 15 years old then. Now, I really did like horror movies when I was a teenager but playing horror video games, HO BOY, that was a different story. While I could sit as far away from the TV screen as possible, playing a horror game required that I sit close to the screen which made it easier for the monsters in games to come out and kill me – at least that’s how I felt. So when I saw F.E.A.R. on store shelves I had to buy it to face my fears (no pun intended) but… I never went past level 3 because I was so scared of the little girl in the red dress. She reminded me so much of that little girl from “The Ring” movie that I just chickened out and sold my copy to someone on NOT-ebay. Fast forward 15 years later, I figured it was about time I played the game that scared me so much as a kid. Well, I’m happy to say that I finished the game and that I had a jolly good time.

[h1] I don’t think F.E.A.R. is a good horror game [/h1]

F.E.A.R. as its name suggests, is a horror game right? I mean, its name is the emotion creatures get when they are scared, so obviously it’s a horror game right. Well… YES and NO? F.E.A.R. is actually a first person shooter with horror elements. Hmmm… Maybe a Horror game with a heavy emphasis on shooting? No… Look, here’s the deal: F.E.A.R. wants to be a horror game and when it wants to be scary it can be BUT it often forgets that it’s a horror game and just focuses on shooting dudes. 

The majority of my time spent with F.E.A.R. was while shooting cloned super-soldiers and security guards and only ever so often, and for only a couple of minutes at the most, I would get scary scenes that would reveal some plot elements or give me a good jump scare. These scary scenes make up about 20% of this game while the other 80% is shooting dudes.
Does this make F.E.A.R. a lousy game? Heavens NO! F.E.A.R. while light on horror elements, is still an excellent shooter.

[h1] You are the new recruit that can do it all [/h1]

You play as a nameless protagonist who has just joined First Encounter Assault Recon (F.E.A.R.). This group of highly trained marines/super soldiers comes out when regular super solders or SWATS can’t do their job because it involves something supernatural, like ghosts… boo! So one day, you receive a call that a certain telepathic individual is mind controlling an army of super soldier clones and needs to be stopped. Even the game makes fun of this. Anyway, you arrive at the scene and start investigating. Big surprise, it turns out there are other things involved in this than just a crazy telepathic mind controller. As you are investigating the location and killing soldier clones you start seeing weird scary illusions of a delivery room and a little girl in a red dress. While the rest of your team doesn’t last long on the battlefield, you, despite all odds, always seem to be able to survive each encounter. It is your job to see this case until the end, kill the bad guy, figure out what the deal is with the little girl in the red dress and …. Maybe even figure out who you are?

[h1]The shooting is excellent [/h1]

Like I mentioned above, while F.E.A.R. does have some scary moments they are very brief and rarely spring out. Luckily, you have plenty to do while you wait for the scary moments to pop up because there are a lot of bad guys to kill. Each level (chapter) in F.E.A.R. is played with you trying to navigate through a linear first person level while killing everyone along the way. You can hold 3 different weapons. They range from small handguns to deadly disintegration rifles. Shooting feels amazing in this game. It’s the kind of polished first person shooter experience that you only see in games like Half-life https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/ 
or Halo https://store.steampowered.com/app/1064221/Halo_Combat_Evolved_Anniversary/.
The guns feel amazing, aiming feels responsive and, most importantly, it’s really fun. There is a leaning mechanic which I got so addicted to that I tried to finish every single encounter by leaning from a corner. You also have a few more tricks up your sleeve. Since this is an older FPS, you don’t have recoverable health but instead have to resort to finding first aid kits and bullet-proof armor. You can hold up to 10 health kits in your inventory and use them when in trouble but you can’t hold armor. You also have reflex mode, which is the slow motion in this game. Depending on how you play the game, this can either be extremely useful or something you often forget you have. During the first few hours, I barely used it but by the end of the game, I found myself using it quite often. 

[h1] A warehouse, a corporate office an abandoned building complex… Scary enough for you? [/h1]

The entire game takes place in the above mentioned locations. While you aren’t shooting dudes, you will be navigating the level until the next gunfight or scary moment. Often, your road will take you through a dark hallway and that’s where you pop out your flashlight. Don’t just rush to the next fight though. Explore a little bit. You might just find some permanent health and reflex boosts as well as some extra health kits and weapons.

[h1] Smart enemies but not too smart [/h1]

People often praise the enemy AI in this game about how smart they are. While I have to agree that the enemies are smarter than the average FPS AI, some of their behavior is… questionable. For example, they won’t just stand and shoot, they will run, hide, flank you, surprise you and call their allies for help, however, they will also happily charge at you, one by one, while you mercilessly mow them down from the same hiding place. I guess this really can’t be helped since many of the levels have tight corridors and there aren’t that many ways the enemies can engage you. Overall, I certainly agree that the enemy AI will keep you busy, no matter which difficulty you choose, but I just wish they wouldn’t charge so often into my shotgun. 

[h1] Don’t buy this game ON STEAM [/h1]

At this point, I think I’ve made it clear that I’ve had a great time with this game. I would whole heartedly recommend you go and buy it right now BUT, I can’t, at least not here on Steam. See, Warner Brothers know that this game is great and popular and that people want it. However, they also have Fear 2 and Fear 3 which, I guess, aren’t as popular as this first game. So, because they are greedy, slimy, consumer-unfriendly, publishers, they made it possible to only get this game (and the two expansions) if you buy the entire F.E.A.R. franchise for 60 $. 

60 $ for all F.E.A.R. games is actually an OK price BUT, here’s the thing, you are able to buy F.E.A.R. 2 and 3 separately but not this game. So, they are hoping that you will fork out 60 dollars just so you can play this game that’s 15 years old as of writing this. If you want to buy the entire package, go right ahead but, if you just want to play this game, here’s what you should do:

[h2] Go to GOG, and buy F.E.A.R. Platinum instead of this bundle [/h2] 

And since it’s a GOG version, share it with a friend because GOG is awesome.  Not saying that other F.E.A.R. games are bad but if you just want to play this original one, GOG is your best answer. F.E.A.R. is a fantastic first person shooter with some nice horror elements. I absolutely recommend you buy this game ... just not on Steam.

The DLC 'Extraction Point' plays like a downgraded version of the original with boring maps which go on and on. The combat can sometimes be frustrating when you surrounded by enemies which may come out of nowhere. The original had a more catchy story to compensate and less enemy surprises. On the positive side this is a game again in the good LithTech engine and it has added a mini gun."
76561198139361166,1590885351,True,Fun gunplay and the enemies feel like a challenge without feeling cheap.

Bullet time is still a very fun mechanic. As mentioned, more action than horror, but it's a classic for a reason.

By the way, make sure you research how to fix the fps drop before playing. No, you're not the only one. Yes, I am fairly sure it happens to everyone."

[h1] Positives: [/h1]
+Game uses a bullet time mechanic allowing you to perform some really satisfying kills.
+Features some really great A.I that are smart enough to become very deadly in combat. They are also very vocal making combat more engaging.
+Level design is very good, not just allowing you but also the A.I to take routes to flank each other.
+Particle effects and destruction leave rooms with big bullet holes and smoke everywhere.
+Music is good in combat and in the more ambient parts of the game.
+The lighting.
+The sounds.
+Comes with a DLC (Extraction point) which some consider better than the original game.
[h1] Negatives: [/h1]
-Some textures can look outdated.
-Environments can be very repetitive since you will be mostly traveling indoors.
-For some reason you cant buy the game separately from the two other games which i find really weird."

With that said, what it does do, it does well.  The combat is pretty intense, and there is no shortage of it.  It is also interspersed with some more quiet, creepy encounters that I never really got used to.  

All I can say is: Look at the screenshots.  If you like shooting at the same enemy in a bunch of not that different buildings, then this is the game for you!  I will give a positive review because it is a very competently made game."
76561198293768944,1590371890,True,One of the best first person shooters out their. I used to watch my college roommate play it but never tried it myself until over ten years later. The game aged extremely well and mixes horror with action perfectly.

76561197993676001,1590233959,True,"While the other entries have their charms the original F.E.A.R is still the best of the series. Back when it was released this felt like an important game. This game tries to be a lot of things, and it does most of them well. 

What made F.E.A.R memorable were the clever AI, kooky guns, jump scares and the wonderful ever-present feeling of existential dread. While playing this game I would find myself thinking [i] “It’s not as scary as it’s supposed to be”[/i] and then noticing a faster heartrate, dry mouth and getting caught out by the same jump scares that got me back in 2005. That's good design.

I always enjoy 3-way conflict. Here it's between you, the Replica and Armacham soldiers. I always wondered if the Replica soldier idea was designed much later their in-game behaviour. After all, the soldier’s all talk to each other and use squad tactics. So, what exactly is the “psychic commander” doing? Nevertheless, enemy A.I is still better than a lot of modern shooters.

Level design is noticeably absurd with endlessly twisting corridors. It's hard to believe you are in a functional building. Some sections feel a little repetitive. 

The story pulls you in, revealing, bit by bit. I can’t play this game without listening to every phone message. Fettel was a highlight, with a Peter Lurie’s wonderfully creepy delivery. Here, he’s in small doses rather than incessantly in your face, as per F.E.A.R 3. 

It’s hard to say whether new players would enjoy this. But it certainly has strong nostalgic appeal."

76561198152815988,1590104060,True,"It's like Half-Life and Resident Evil got together and had a child together. In other words, it's epic yet also keeps you on your toes like those 2 game franchises have. The AI is smart, so during gun fights, the move around and use cover so you have to pick your shots well or you'll run out of ammo and be left using melee to get through. The only cons I have is if you are more for graphics for your games, then this game isn't for you and plus the game lags at times. Other than that, the game keeps you engaged and using options on how to either out-flank the enemies or go in guns blazing. I hope this review helps. Enjoy the gaming experience for those who decide to try this amazing classic fps title when games were about keeping you in suspense instead of being a straight-forward and rather boring experience in gaming."
76561199013355436,1590057136,True,"Hands down one of my all time favorites. Runs good on new hardware. Graphics have aged but character models and weapons still look great. The combat, over arching suspense, and horror make this game a must play."

76561197994567313,1589856542,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of the quintessential PC FPS games. It's a game that can be favorably compared to the original Half-life. It could be considered a hybrid of a horror game and a shooter, and it is that, but it's also more than that. 

In general, I dislike horror games, but this one does everything right. Some horror games with shooting gameplay include horror elements by having the actual enemies you fight be horrific or gruesome. F.E.A.R. doesn't do that. The majority of the enemies you fight are humanoid soldiers. You're heavily-armed, and it's not that there are powerful nightmare monsters that can dismember you with a thought to be afraid of. Instead, the horror in the game is delivered through the sound design, the lighting and ambiance, and the creepy, unexplained paranormal phenomena that occur.

And the jump scares. Oh, yes. My favorite one - yes, I actually have a favorite, and look forward to it every time I replay the game - is when [spoiler] you approach a ladder to climb down, and during the process you have to turn around; as you turn around and start climbing down the ladder, Alma appears right where you were standing at the top of the ladder just a second before. It's perfect.[/spoiler]

There's gore, but it's not too gruesome, and the jump scares aren't too pants-wettingly terrifying. The game also shifts between horror segments and shooting segments, so you're rarely frightened during a shooting segment, and rarely fighting for your life during a horror segment. I appreciate this shifting back and forth.

The plot is interesting, too. It starts off a little bland, and you're not given much to go on, but over the course of the game you find out more about the backstory and lore and what's going on right now and it all starts to piece together and gets really interesting. The stand-alone expansion packs flesh out the story, too.

The gunplay is fairly standard, but satisfying. What makes it really stand out is how intelligent the AI is, even by modern standards - enemies call out to each other and coordinate attacks, flank, use cover and grenades, dive through windows, etc. To keep up with these intelligent enemies, your character has a slo-mo ability that can be triggered at will; you can also lean out of cover, and you have a few additional melee abilities such as a jump-kick and slide-kick. The guns themselves feel very powerful, and lining up a slo-mo headshot is particularly satisfying.

In summary, I appreciate nearly everything about this game, it still holds up well after all these years, and it's a blast to play."
76561198865067201,1589654416,True,"This is a very good game! Definitely check it out, the combination of horror and action is done tastefully, without feeling corny. The AI is also worth mentioning, as it was programmed so well here."

76561198452856063,1589487050,True,Great shooter. It's simple very much so in the sort of vein as CoD would be except a little spookier. That said the AI is fantastic and the environments give you a real creep factor that the other games in the series never really accomplish. 8/10
76561197970642570,1589479429,True,Still great after all these years. Get it.
76561199033738800,1589464031,True,It goes by its name. The FEAR factor is high. I am still playing and discovering the game and its story.
76561198047333591,1589409385,True,"FEAR is not nearly as flawless as 20 year old boomers would like you to believe but it's still a pretty decent game with a surprisingly interesting story. 

The game is dead simple in terms of game play. You just stroll through levels and shoot brain dead dummies in the face while in slo-mo. FEAR really doesn't offer too much as a shooter but it's still satisfying enough to turn someone into a bloody mist, nail them to a wall with a stake through the head, evaporate flesh from their bones or simply watch them flail cause your shots knocked them off balance. The mechanical complexity of FEAR is very low but the spectacle is high.

This is very much aided by over the top effects. Every fight will have dust kicking up, surfaces getting chunks torn out of them, etc. All while there's slow-mo bullet trails in the air and sparks bouncing off of enemies armor as you shoot them. Some sound effects could be meatier I think but overall it's still rather nice to decimate enemies in this game.

A lot of people would like you to believe that enemies are smart but personally I never experienced that. I will commend them for often properly using cover and throwing grenades but that's about as far as it goes. In theory, they can flank you but most levels don't give them that opportunity. A lot of their perceived intelligence comes from their radio chatter. There's a lot of lines there, and they create an illusion of squad coordination between replicas while also giving you feedback on the situation. 

Another annoying thing about enemies is that variety is very poor. Most of the time you will fight grunts that can't do much more than shooting or throwing grenades. There's occasional snipers and guys with rocket launchers but they're too rare. Assassins are cool but barely used. Meanwhile turrets, mechs and laser drones should've been cut from the game entirely. They're not fun to fight and their segments could've been used for something better. Personally I think they should've expanded on assassins and had an enemy who could take advantage of walls and ceilings to spice up the more enclosed levels.

Where FEAR really stands out from generic shooters is the story. Usually a story in FPS is the last thing you'd care about but Monolith really put some effort into this. If you dig into the phone calls and laptop convos and main narrative you get a story about the classic mysterious experiments that unravels into something genuinely tragic. There's a lot of nuances in the game but the main point I think is the relationship between Wade, Alma and Paxton. You keep getting little details about Wade's experiments, how Alma was abuse or Fettel's childhood. I don't want to just retell the story but needless to say I found it intriguing.

Overall FEAR is well worth playing to this day. The game is only about 8 hours long without rushing or anything and pros outweight the cons."
76561198857851395,1589405293,True,"This game holds up way better than a lot of modern games. There’s some really great dynamic lighting effects that hide the dated textures while creating a genuinely creepy atmosphere. The enemy AI is pretty smart and will often flank you if you try to camp somewhere and take advantage of small holes in level geometry to get you. Really feels ahead of its time when it comes to AI and level design. 
Except for a small number of encounters I really felt like this was a firm but fair challenge. You always get a reasonable amount of time to react before you have to take on a room of 10 guys. 
Only gripes are that I had to troubleshoot a few performance issues for running this on a modern system and there’s no way to switch to hold to aim from toggle aim. 
8.5/10, terrific shooter that I’ll be revisiting for sure.
Also, I got all the games/expansions in the series for like $4. Wait for a sale or look around at key seller sites.

76561198128592391,1588811592,True,"I just beat this game, my first time ever playing it. No nostalgia here. However old it may be, this is one of the best first person shooters I've ever played."
76561198380597326,1588732979,True,Game's jank af but it's still one of the best shooters of the 2000s. Play if you want the best shotgun in video game history and watching clones be exploded John Woo style.
76561197999165516,1588697691,True,Very good atmospheric game.
76561198048872030,1588659557,True,"Extremely late to the bandwagon on this title, but I finally finished a play through of this game and it was definitely worth it. This game was an instant classic. The gun play was very solid, especially when you don't use slow motion. The A.I. created for this are insanely smart when it comes to the tactics they use to get the better of you. Add in the difficulty setting of Extreme and you've got a formula for one of the tightest gun fighting mechanics ever seen.

The horror is to be praised as well. Although the horror sequences are scripted and don't normally do anything to the player besides set them on edge, they are beautifully, beautifully done and the atmosphere created when blended with the environment, makes for a game that a lot of people may find themselves setting down for a moment, just to get themselves mentally prepared to dive back into it.

The biggest things I feel this game lacks in, are enemy variety, and the lack of enemies that give the feel of an ACTUAL boss. Most ""boss"" encounters are just enemies with a broken weapon type they don't normally have (that will deal stupid amounts of damage in the Extreme difficulty), or they will be lack luster heavy mech type enemies that pose almost no challenge if approached carefully with a big boy gun (like the particle cannon).

Overall, this game is an amazing horror FPS experience. If you haven't yet, pick it up and play it."
76561198062713417,1588559846,False,Boring. The AI is ok considering how old it is. I'd imagine most of the positive reviews come from people who played it when it was new.
76561197980563719,1588558750,True,"TL;DR: Worth playing if you're curious what was hi-tech and new in 2005.

For the most part, I enjoyed this game, perhaps because I played it first on the 360 back in 2006, was disappointed, and always wondered if the PC version was able to rectify the port's issues.  It's obviously aged, and by quite a bit, but it is an interesting time capsule of pre-Half-Life 2 gameplay mindset (F.E.A.R. obviously released the year after HL2, but most definitely has the story-telling and gameplay of a game pre-HL2) that has fun use of physics, and interesting scare mechanics (though, they're more jump-scares than anything that would make one truly fearful).  The main issue I see is its length: it definitely overstays its welcome, and you could tell the same story in about two thirds of the time.  The action is generally good, and playing on Extreme difficulty is a somewhat interesting challenge, but I would recommend playing a lower difficulty to get through the game quicker.  The weapons are okay, fun, but not much in the way of variety, and where the rarer weapons drop can be disappointing since you're limited to three weapons at any time.  Make sure to look up a site like pcgamingwiki so that you can get things like proper wide-screen, and soft-shadows as well as anti-aliasing.  It's a game that always had a lot of potential, but could use an edit and a re-master.  Only real negatives that truly bugged me were the footsteps (you sound as though you walk with a stride of maybe a foot lol) and the fact that the ghost-type enemies eat away at your armor; the latter just doesn't make sense to me, since the whole thing is supposed to be in a type of dreamworld."
76561198044607761,1588544956,True,generally a good shootem upper
76561197974936987,1588534173,True,"FEAR is a cool game, but I sure do hate the level design of wandering through similar looking areas in between action sequences because of weird level design. Also, a complaint that i manage to work around, but dont like, is that its really easy to go from full health to almost dead because it's hard to get good feedback on when you're taking damage, and the health icon is really easy to miss when you're in a firefight. Beyond that though, it's still pretty fun, the AI is great, and the mix of horror is a welcome change of pace to this day"
76561197992235452,1588529452,True,"Great game, I enjoyed it a lot. 
There is good reason it st1ill holds up today. Even if the game is getting older, the gameplay and graphics and music are great enough for it to be a timeless gem for gamers. Everyone should play through F.E.A.R. and both expansion DLCs. It reminded me of Half Life 2 as a shooter, you can find a lot of parallels. The story is interesting and lends to cool trippy events during the game, not all that scary but can be pretty thrilling esp the shootouts. The plot is good enough to follow and try to make sense of things as events unfold, and it stays mysterious and not completely explained. I am still unclear on the player's part in the story and why exactly out of everyone Alma doesn't just splatter your guts with her mind like a wood chipper.  You are a special super soldier, I guess they feel a connection... Anyhow, the mystery also helps pull you along in the game hoping it will find resolve and answers to the story, so never fully understanding it can be a good thing. Time to get into F.E.A.R. 2!"

What I like about the game:
+Good shooting and gameplay, especially dual welding pisols, karate and fantastic weapon arsenal
+Beautiful atmosphere
+Little horror elements here and there
+Very smart AI!

What I don't like about the game:
-Janky animations
-The soundtracks just doesn't fit. Except the menu theme.
-Norton Mapes. The fat man kind of destroyed the game - which is supposed to be HORROR and serious game. The devs could've fixed this by torturing this fatty a slow and painful death in agony but nope. Game would've been much better without him.
-WORST OFFENDER. GAME DOES NOT SAVE!!!!! Cloud saving does jack shit, the game does save locally but in a really strange way, unlike regular game that saves in normal documents folder, no it saves on ""public documents"" I literally never know this this folder existed till now, 12 hours of fucking progress is gone.

76561198056025386,1587932643,True,One of the best games ever made. Perfect blend of Horror/FPS
76561197993271418,1587930611,True,"For a 15 yr old game, FEAR is still fairly impressive. The story is a bit generic but does have some interesting twists at the very end. There are some genuinely creepy bits, so I'd classify this as an action-horror game. The first hour and the last hour lean into the horror, but the middle is mostly action. The AI is impressive, even by 2020 standards, and the effects are pretty cool. The biggest cons are that the gameplay is heavily dependent on the slow-time feature. So much so, that I'd say it's a total crutch. Going into any fights without the slow-mo charged is near suicide. There isn't a lot of enemy variety, and there really aren't any real boss fights, especially when you consider that any 'bosses' show up multiple times by the end. The biggest disappointment was that there wasn't any kind of a final boss at the end. There's some story exposition which reveals the twist, but that's about it. One other complaint is the lack of a mini-map or something that helps guide you, especially when stuck. In addition, sometimes you're flush with ammo, health, and armor and other times it's a barren wasteland. However, that's nitpicking. If you're looking for a retro flashback now that your computer can actually handle the effects of this game, you can't go wrong with the original FEAR."
76561197975827572,1587927766,True,"Still a great game i enjoy the combat and story alot, good scared all round"
76561198200366607,1587918308,True,"Let me start off first by saying that I had a lot of issues running this game. At first it wouldn't save properly making me play the prologue on a loop until it was fixed and the constant fps drops that really hinders the experience. I had to download a third-party fix to actually get it running properly. despite my issues of course yours may differ, and regardless, 15 years later if you haven't played this game, it's so worth it if you are a fan of over-the-top action games and tactical shooters, the A.I to this day is some of the most advanced tech I've yet to see. I'm disappointed in the horror aspect of things but of course that is up to you if its a scary game or not"
76561198053348783,1587864994,True,"Pretty cool FPS.

Too bad the horror segment brought down the enjoyement of the game a little for me

(Don't take into account the low play time and refund state; I first bought it on Steam years ago, didn't like it and refunded it; I more recently bought it on GoG, and had a blast; when I realized I could leave a review here I did)"
76561197971822440,1587812201,True,"A must-have classic. Apart from the character models, the game still holds up graphically and the gunplay is still excellent. Enemies are smart and will use teamwork to try flank and kill you, something you don't see in many modern games (where AI enemies tend to either insta-snipe-headshot you through a hole in a fence from 300m away with a pistol or spray 'n' pray out in the open like drunk storm troopers). 

It's a challenging, fun and cathartic game that desperately needs a modern successor. In the meantime, give this game a try, especially if it's on sale."

76561197978535002,1587744317,True,"Fun overall FPS, though the story is a bit weak and the play does get a bit repetitive.   AI is excellent and graphics are decent for a somewhat older game."
76561198061513199,1587722872,True,"While it is a rather short experience overall, it is to this day one of my all-time favorite games. While the physics can be a little wacky and the textures can be a little dated, those more-so add to the experience than take away from it. 10/10. Penetrating people never felt so good."
76561198063493580,1587698812,True,"F.E.A.R. is almost 15 years old, and it still manages to be a tantalizing example of how effective the first person viewpoint is when making horror and atmosphere mesh together. This is both a solid horror title and a fantastic shooter in its own right, with excellent A.I. that communicates with other enemies to try and flank and outwit you. The gunplay is fluid and all the weapons feel like they have ample punch. The best part of the game is the story, which is both original and fantastic; the overall play of the game is fairly similar to the immersiveness of Half-Life. Soundtrack is also great and amplifies the action and horror tenfold.

The only downside to this game is that it hasn't aged well in the graphics or coding department; the graphics are fairly muddy (but textures can be fixed with mods), and there's a really weird coding glitch where if you use a Logitech keyboard/mouse the game will stutter as if it's having FPS drops. If you get this problem when playing, check your device manager and disable ""HID-Compliant Device"" in the device manager (you'll likely have 3-7) and this will likely fix the issue. Apparently these are commonly linked with extra mouse/keyboard buttons and F.E.A.R. doesn't know how to handle them, so it glitches out and causes massive stutter. Other than that, this game is nearly flawless.

TL;DR: F.E.A.R. is fantastic and should be enjoyed by everyone who likes FPS and/or Horror titles. fantastic gameplay, story, atmosphere, and enemy A.I. Runs on a potato, but has some easily fixed compatibility issues with Logitech products. 9.5/10."

76561198098143734,1587452603,True,"Loved this game.  The A.I. is just fantastic and makes the gunfights a lot of fun.  The guns are weighty and there aren't a million different kinds so you get use to them, but they all feel substantial and powerful.  The shotgun is by far the most fun to use.  Turn your enemies into a fine red mist.  Also, the game is genuinely scary, and when you interact with Alma, it's creepy in a really atmospheric way.  I loved this!"

The story is a mess and there are gameplay issues like having super powered weapons like rocket launchers but no enemies difficult enough to use them on so you'll be dragging them around until the end of the game just in case (spoiler alert: the enemy variety doesn't change much).

Saying that I found the lighting really great with lots of really dark shadows and light sources that can be played with. The AI was really enjoyable to play around with and general gun-play with slowing down time was fun but almost essential for every single encounter so expect A LOT of slow motion gun fights and hiding behind pillars waiting for your slo-mo meter to refill (it gets tiresome).

Enjoyable, but a masterpiece? No. It was a stepping stone for the genre and is interesting to play because of that but it is far from perfect.

76561198009474997,1586789145,True,"F.E.A.R. Review

Terror will take you; just accept that!

Some key points that this game offers:

1.	Brilliant AI mechanics
2.	Slow Motion
3.	Paranormal activities
4.	Very challenging gameplay 

Gameplay & Controls:

The game is played either by keyboard and mouse, or with a controller; the choice comes down to the player and platform. Whether you play on console or PC you will receive the same brilliant experience. Game handling is smooth and very precisely done. 

You are part of F.E.A.R., First Encounter Assault Recon that specializes in all things paranormal. Things are going to get weird, very weird and unnerving indeed. A paramilitary force has attacked and infiltrated an aerospace compound, taking hostages and killing everyone else. There has been no demands or word from them.

The government decided to send in a team of Special Forces to assess the situation, but they were killed instantly under very odd circumstances that cannot be rationally explained. With no other available option, F.E.A.R. is tasked to evaluate the situation and eliminate the threat at any cost.

This is where you come in, a new member, recently transferred to F.E.A.R.

Graphics:

Incredible! The bullet dynamics and damage are very realistic. The detail of the levels is all beautifully created. The lighting and shadow quality for the game is impeccable. It adds a layer of realism and beauty to the whole game. 

Character models may not vary in quality, but the few that there is have all received their own share of quality treatment to ensure that every element of the game is picture perfect. Under the settings there are a wide variety of settings to customize your game, and trust me this monster is going to test your machines capabilities.

Sounds:

Thrilling, amazing and downright scary… Take your pick. The background sounds add life and horror to the levels. Between the gun fights and level exploration there will be a variety of eerie sounds that never bodes well! It might be static sounds, a child’s laughter… or Alma herself, you simply never know… You just Fear what might be around that corner.
Under the settings panel you have full volume control to customize how the sounds modify your heart rate.

Replayability:

F.E.A.R. has a number of different difficulties to play, you can really test your skills out on higher difficulties. 
For those that enjoy multiplayer, F.E.A.R. offers you just that, take things online with your friends and teach them the meaning of fear.

MGR Gaming’s Conclusions:
Spoilers ahead:

F.E.A.R. is through and through a masterpiece on its own. It incorporates a brilliant enemy AI system that will test your skills just as much as it will test your resolve. These soldiers act and adapt to each situation to constantly test you, they aren’t just programmed to offer resistance, they are actively trying to kill you. If you play F.E.A.R. on a higher difficulty it will give you a better understanding of what I’m trying to say here. 

They will flank you; they will pin you down, and unless you can take a stand and take control of the situation, you will be killed, over and over again! This is F.E.A.R. and there is no time for fear. Fight to live and then kill or be killed. You cannot appreciate the marvel of this AI unless you experience it for yourself. What this game offers is way ahead of the curve!
The SloMo feature really does help a lot, and in more instances than I can count it has saved my life and helped me come out on top. This is a brilliant little feature that they added to the game, not only to make things a little bit easier, but it adds its own beauty and creative look to the game.

The story line; there is so much to say, the strange noises, the visions, the scary girl in a red dress… These mysterious soldiers, how does it all tie in? There is a brilliant story to it all, be sure to give F.E.A.R. a playthrough and you will experience this brilliant story for yourself.

76561198159069252,1586785631,True,This game truly is a blast from the past and the gunplay is pretty good for its time and I just love the bullet time and the physics and atmosphere of this game 7.5/10
76561198065253788,1586761781,True, SWEEEEEEEEEEEET
76561198197596201,1586749785,True,"Very fun, can be scary, the gunfights are still awesome due to the A.I. still being better than 90% of games coming out in the year 2020. Turn the difficulty to Very Hard for the most enjoyment - it turns each encounter with the enemy into a matrix style slow-mo ""dance"".

 An impressive achievement I will return to for many replays in the future"
76561197986728830,1586733630,True,Still a fun game
76561198039265246,1586727106,True,"Every couple of years, I feel the need to re-play all the F.E.A.R. games.  They’re just that good.  Sure, the graphics of this original entry in the series can’t compare with modern games, but the creepy atmosphere and the challenge of an ahead-of-its-time A.I. are what keep me coming back for repeat experiences.  F.E.A.R.is without a doubt one of the best first person shooters I’ve ever played.  The combat is intense and bloody, the visuals are terrific and bloody, and the paranormal storyline is creepy and bloody.  Yes, blood and gore are everywhere.  It’s science fiction meets horror meets engineered carnage at its best.  The game offers plenty of jump scares and creepy moments, several which you may miss if you aren’t paying attention, and the gameplay is challenging, with enemy forces working together and sometimes sneaking up on you out of the blue.  In addition to dark, spectacular psychic visions (your source of insight into what is really going on at the heart of the story) the best and creepiest shots feature a young and darkly mysterious Alma spectrally manifesting herself somewhere on the periphery of your vision.  The music and sound effects add extra doses of darkness to the whole atmosphere.  With four different levels of play, F.E.A.R. offers a great experience to everyone from beginners to the most skilled of gamers.  While the storyline may leave a few questions unanswered, it leaves plenty of room for further exploration in the sequels.  One of the most atmospheric and doggone fun to play first person shooters ever created, F.E.A.R. is a game I will keep coming back to repeatedly."
76561198236143050,1586725196,True,Play it.
76561198306039311,1586683898,True,Idk what to say . It's just classic shooting game .
76561198099420303,1586619693,True,"I got this game because I wanted to get a horror game to stream on Twitch and I had always heard how scary this game was, yeah it was scary when it was made. Don't get me wrong it is a good FPS but the horror aspect no longer holds up. I got the whole series for about $13 so I can't complain too much. LSS good shooter bad horror."
76561198320140625,1586598114,True,"A very nice FPS and it will keep you engaged with the paranormal lady throwing shit at you and spooking you when you arent watching. Overall a good game and the enemy AI was IMO one of the best I have seen. Great job AI team. The game is long and may feel it is dragging out a bit, but thats ok, later you would love it. I highly recommend this game."
76561198132244015,1586549501,True,Shotgun and kicking people in the dick never felt so good. AI is still absolutely amazing over 10 years later. One of the best FPS games on the PC period.
76561198259386608,1586509982,True,"I always wanted to play through the entire Fear franchise after playing Fear 3 on the xbox 360 when I was a teen. 

I bought the entire franchise package on sale and really have a lot to say about the first game and it's two expansion episodes.

First off, the base game is amazing. It's probably one of the best FPS / Action titles I've ever played in my life. The gunplay is amazing, the jump scares are so well timed and actually fit. The lighting and sound design passes that of AAA games that get tossed out today...It's amazing, just absolutely amazing. A must play for all FPS fans.

Extraction Point is just as good if not a littttle bit better. It's a lot more intense and scary than the vanilla game. The action and pacing work a lot better since you're used to the structure of levels and understand what the game expects from you, which is great because Extraction Point slowly starts to twist your expectations and throw you through action packed spooky loops.

Skip the third episode, it's fucking bizarre and really out of place.

Tl;dr for this review - FEAR is a masterpiece and should not be slept on, you owe it to yourself to experience this title."
76561198123100625,1586507097,True,"the epic AI and game-play mechanics  gives many games a run for their money,"
76561198058097346,1586488409,True,"A good classic shooter, also considered a classic-cult probably due to the horror nature. For its time the game has stunning visuals & environments coupled with a slow-mo effect which really brings out chaos you're inflicting on the surrounding area & bad guys. You can kick in mid-air too which is cool.

Balls of steel are required if you don't want to shit your pants, because jumpscares do exist here."
76561198280133587,1586472889,True,recommendation
76561198268813641,1586469660,True,very good and AI is fun to go against but don't play the expansion packs they're a waste of time since they aren't even cannon
76561198068190589,1586459127,True,"Growing up i never thought much of FEAR never seemed to interest me, however after getting my pc and seeing the trilogy was on sale i thought might as well buy it and boy do i love buying it. The AI in this game is one of the best parts of this game, making smart moves to flank you and try to mix their tactics. I recommend this game to anyone that wants a challenge and a good scare also as a creepy child tries to mess with your head throughout the game"
76561197998626822,1586457877,True,"Despite being released back in 2005 this game set the standards for slow-mo and AI. It's a very unique shooter which on hardest difficulties challenges you at all times. Controls can be a bit clunky, but it isn't something that can't be tweaked. Oh, and the sad story of Alma is dark and brutal even for today's standards."
76561198005546861,1586408959,True,good action
76561197996887102,1586403858,True,"FEAR is a great game.  The AI behavior is startlingly intelligent, especially when compared to many modern games where the enemy AI is usually restricted to ""run at you, shoot and die"".  Also, the AI doesn't have to cheat to be a challenge.  When they kill you it's because they outmaneuvered you."
76561198317988078,1586383778,True,"5/5 Stars
Supremely good game and probably one of the best FPS's of all time. Shooting is highly satisfying, enemy design and AI is EXCELLENT. Story is passable. The horror aspect is usually pretty cheesy and rarely scared me, which I say as someone who's not the most fearless (ha) with horror games. However the horror *atmosphere* is very well done.

Graphics are good for their time but age... well, they're a mixed bag. Human models with faces look like action figures and everybody's animation tends to be rather stiff. Environments and everything in general tend to look too plasticy, although the masked human models look great since the face doesn't accentuate the plasticy look. However, the games EFFECTS are still gorgeous. Everything is cranked up to 11 and still manages to look super clear. This game also has really excellent shrapnel, blood, and water effects.

Major issues I had include your movement speed is insultingly low, like you're walking around with your pants around your ankles the whole time. This really doesn't go well with the fast combat, sliding, and kung-fu melee (although I rarely used the melee attacks myself.) Also, 3 weapon limit is a really bad choice paired with combat as smooth as this and weapons that are quite varied and fun to use. Realism be darned, I have Matrix-style bullet time and am fighting a platoon of super soldiers and some spooky girl who keeps popping up. Was it too much to ask to let me use your entire badass arsenal without dropping the third weapon every time a new one comes along, since my first two are usually an automatic and the Shotgun which are valuable in every situation?

Enemy variety is pretty low and given the game's AI, i would have liked to see more NPC battles or had friendly NPCs tagging alone once in awhile. You have soldiers you fight throughout the game, security guys that behave exactly the same but I think have lower health, elite soldiers that are slightly more bullet-spongy and carry the game's biggest weapons, a big tanky soldier that is entirely mute, and the other couple enemy types are pretty forgettable including weird ghosts at the end that die in one pistol shot because... That's how these weird vision ghosts work I guess? Also I can only remember one fight between the security guys and the actual main soldiers. I'm pretty sure all of your friendly characters are just animated props since they either are never in a point where you SEE them engaging anyone, and the one or two scripted sequences they do they die before you can do anything.

Also, the game sort of isn't sure what to do with itself at the end and reduces you to going through linear hallways, with just a pistol shooting the same appearing weird ghost enemies. Kind of a let down for an entire game that spent its time training you to in free-flowing combat with soldiers.

And lastly, the music is pretty bland. Nothing is really memorable, whether they're the atmospheric or occassional combat riffs. Not even the game's sort of main riff stuck with me. Intro's music is fine, but... still not something that sticks. I wish there was a mod that put more memorable tracks in for combat.

Despite those notable issues though, FEAR is an excellent first person shooter with fluid, well-designed combat, and is a fun time up until the last hour or so. Absolutely recommended to anyone who likes FPS's

And again, the horror isn't very scary, so don't be turned off if you don't like horror games. This is a tightly designed outstanding FPS with good atmosphere first and foremost."

That being said, this game can be unforgiving at times. I wish that they would gear you up for the boss fights a bit better. There was one time where I wasn't prepared for a boss fight and it was a grueling one (I had no ammo, no health kits, and very little health).

Overall, damn good game."

76561198935077372,1585891464,True,"F.E.A.R what a game. Please some developers out there, reboot this game.

Also, it would be cool if all the FEAR games got achievements and trading cards added."
76561198308229181,1585884139,True,"A fantastic old school horror and first person shooter. Great little game that is well worth the time and money to get, has a bit of re-play ability as well."
76561198005311994,1585883162,True,"This game is an absolute classic. Must play - gameplay and graphics hold up really well (but get the FEAR fps drop fix dll and put it in the game's folder. google it. otherwise you'll get terrible fps). The gun play is what makes it so good. The levels are mostly very same ish. Basically there's the first half of the game which is almost all the same environments, then the next 40% is all the same, then the last 10% for novelty. However, the game is so great you pretty much just don't notice. It's long, just long enough, and it has just enough guns and enemies to keep you entertained. The story is pretty crazy. This game gave me a bunch of jump scares."
76561199023671255,1585874499,True,"Even though it is a bit dated both graphically and gameplay style, it still has its moments. It relys quite a bit on jump scares and those still work despite how they look. It can be very challenging at parts but still holds up very well. I played this originally when it came out but never made it all the way through. I'm glad I picked it back up because it really is good. Can't wait to play the rest of them."
76561198029074010,1585859707,True,"Absolutely the BEST horror game I have ever played!  This game does not rely on cheap jump scares that just make you numb to the scary parts after 20 minutes, it really shines by getting into the player's head, making you think you saw something, hearing things, just messing with your mind to the point your own brain is what is scaring you more so than the scenes before you.  I personally hate jump scare type ""horror"" games because they really aren't scary, they just startle you over and over because the designers couldn't think up a better way to make you pee yourself.  F.E.A.R. is the type of psychological thrill ride that makes me want to keep coming back for more!  Looking forward to playing the sequels next!"

76561198204848788,1585719644,True, I have alot of nostalgia of this FPS classic. It surprisingly holds up pretty well.

76561199017074804,1585696945,True,such nostalgia
76561198028910997,1585679727,True,It's a very linear shooter with eerie elements.  If you're looking for an intriguing story with shooting mechanics and a horror element and don't mind dated graphics.  Give this a shot.  Though You will have to tinker a bit with the files due to from what I can only assume is compatibility issues.  But it's easily fixed via copy pasting a file.  Check the discussions boards!

76561198923703324,1585619265,True,"9.5/10

A technical masterpiece that will never be forgotten by true fps enthusiasts and must be experienced by every person who loves this genre.

This game's shooting machanics are damn near perfect and to this fucking day, barely any fps game has come close in terms of enemy AI. Its absolutely mind blowing how this game was so far ahead of its time. Its no wonder the ai gained a legendary status and is still talked about to this day. There  are several video analysis and documentaries about it.

Here is a video example if you care enough about this stuff . You may not notice it if you play it on easy difficulties and abuse the slow mo power, though:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQN3yKYkFmE

The sound design is also incredible. Everything about this game aged like wine (the graphics are still ok too).

Regarding the horror elements, they are ok. There are only a few jumpscares here and there but they dont work that well. Other than that, the game is perfect."
76561198410876030,1585618192,True,"As a first time player, I can confidently say that the game holds up even to this day.  Enemies are sufficiently challenging on max difficulty.  Though this is often because they immediately lock on the instant you step out of cover, their propensity to flank and ability to accurately toss grenades keeps one on their toes in a less ""cheap"" manner.  The shooting segments go down smooth; as the smoke clears after combat I am left in a state of tranquility only known to a soldier that has just asserted dominance over a room packed full of well-trained men armed with automatic weapons that three-shot from any range...

Which sets me up perfectly to shit myself as a little girl in a red outfit crawls out of the shadows at me at unnatural speeds.

76561197980324777,1585541222,True,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. I think I actually still have the cardboard box with the CDs somewhere. You should definitely play this game.

But do NOT buy it from Steam!

I mean, you literally CAN'T buy just the first game from Steam, because Warner Bros. KNOWS you just want the first one, because the other games are a disappointment. So they force you into spending $54.99(!!!) for games where the most recent one came out almost a decade ago. That is patently absurd, and honestly insulting.

You can easily find just the first game (with DLC) on other, totally legitimate, totally secure websites that reddit or whoever you want to ask will vouch for, from which you will get a 100% legitimate Steam code that you come right back here and redeem - for $10. I mean FFS it's on the HumbleBundle Store for $10!

If, for whatever reason, you want to sully the memory of the first installment by playing the sequels, by all means, go ahead. But seriously wait until they're on sale on one of other storefronts.

Right at this moment, the FEAR Complete Pack is on sale on Steam for $13.74. That is an okay price for the whole franchise. But in 13 hours it's going right back up to $54.99, and with it, WB's middle finger in our faces.

It has a great story, atmosphere, a great expansion and one that's not so good (PM just isn't anywhere near as good as extraction point) and the best combat ever. would highly recommend this game. 

Just be careful if you uninstall this game. If you do, make sure to remove the save files for the game in the appdata on your PC. If you don't, the game will crash on save game load."

I have a decent amount of patience, but damn it throws me off everytime a new area loads and the game decides to quicksave. Because of this being such a issue I figure that it'll actually save me the headache if I instead just let the game do the saving for me that way I don't have to 1-2 minutes incase I want to quicksave by hitting F5. Hit or Miss I'd probably say Miss - Recommand buying the CD somewhere from like Amazon or something of the sort. All complaints aside really fun and brings the paranoia out of me which I actually love - I see a shadow and I instinctively say ""Hell no - get the **** back here!"" and the gunfights are pretty cool too, but they defintely take some time to get used too - Its defintely unique. Score wise? I'd give 8.5/10 only because the frames kill my mental and heart a little bit each time it happends."

This game has the best gun-fu, bullet time, slo mo, kick-flip-and-headshot gameplay I've experienced, and makes me willing to look past the minimalistic story and largely ineffective horror.

It'll be safe to hide behind cover, peek out, and shoot enemies, but if you fling yourself into the mosh and go HAM, you won't regret it.  Also, the much-vaunted AI is great, and the frequent use of dynamic lighting is awesome.  Give it a try, I'd heartily recommend it."

That being said, I can also see why it was a little uneven as the first game in the series. I love the reflex mode gameplay, but I did not realize until I had played for a while that I would have to rely on it to survive nearly every enemy encounter. Also, it being the year 2020, some of the graphical aspects of the horror segments can fall flat for those used to the more recent offerings in horror games. However, some of them hold up surprisingly well, even given the time and technical achievements that have occurred in the years since. But the game would have been on the better side of generic were it not for the compelling story. The story is pretty mundane in the medium of film, but is very refreshing when paired with a first-person shooter.

While the game isn't even remotely scary, having the horror subtones is really refreshing and a pleasure to have.
The game's combat is straight up one of the best FPS combats out there and it holds up beautifully to this day. This is thanks to how good all the weapons feel(that shotgun is LEGENDARY) your explosives feel meaty and impactful, and the slow-mo is a genius implementation. All this and I didn't even mention the game's iconic A.I. which to this day, downright stomps over ANY modern shooter, let alone any game period, the game has it's reputation for a reason. 
The only real gripes I can think of is graphically, it looks like a potato and for some bizarre reason, the game absolutely HATES Logitech mice and will drop down to 15fps. The fix being that you have to disable the HID compliant mice in device manager, which then the game will run at 200fps at least, I'm pretty sure my new rig could hit 300fps unless the engine hardcaps.

Seriously, The base game works FINE with some performance issues, the Perseus Mandate expansion is buggy and crashes often, and the Extraction Point expansion, (you know? the good one?) Lacks widescreen support which even the base game had, and freezes at random.

As far as the game goes, it was definitely fun. AI was very advanced for its time, and combat was fun. For some reason, subtitles didn't work for me, and I could barely understand the audio in game due to my hearing impairment. Had to look up what the story was about after I beat the game, sadly."

76561198815634101,1583098115,True,"First time playthrough start to finish. Pretty good story line. Its an action game with a small splash of story and a sprinkle of horror. Holds up in 2020.
Not one of the top games of 2005  Res 4, Shaddow of the Colosus, Battlefield 2 or Doom 3 would be games I would play again before this one but definitely one of the better games.

The good:
-Sound effects were awesome. They put alot of work to make the smaller details awesome. Hitting a garbage can and hearing it roll, accidently kicking a soda can in an intense moment made my jump more than once. Gun sound effects were great!
-Graphics are great and seem fairly up to date. The charachters are pretty meh looking but the detail to surroundings are great.
-Music is below average. Not many musical scores that seem memorable. The lack of the music really does subtract from the horror theme. Some rooms have music scores in it that really makes the experiences enjoyable .
-AI fights were sporadic and I enjoyed how enemies would move around and try to flank you.

The bad:
-Voice acting was okay.  Some lip syncing issues.
-Lack of different enemies. Way to few of them and didnt really come with a lot of back story on why I was fighting some of them.

The Ugly:
- The comm system that has your team talking to you is very low and hard to hear.
- The display of your weapons should be made bigger."

Therefore I got lost in a room where I should climb a stair and move to the other side using pipes, sure. I would've seen it, if floor wasn't shining a lot more than my actual objective so show me there was a upgrade underground.

I was interested in experimenting each game I own on steam for at least an hour, but after I died in this one I didn't want to try again. It did not introduce any considerable concept after the first 10 minutes of game, and I wasn't learning anything new. It could be a great game by the end and due to the reviews it currently has, but considering that the time I spent on it could've be used playing another thing. I wouldn't recommend as something to play due to the amount of another unique experiences out there.

I hope that is useful."
76561198017076013,1582921510,True,"One of best FPS ever made, up there with Doom, Half Life, Quake, Duke Nukem and the others. It's just fun to shoot things, most guns feel powerful, and the gunfights generally turn into ""controlled slow-mo chaos"" thanks to a combination of Max Payne in first person mixed with John Woo's movies ( depris flying everywhere, etc ).

The environments are not really varied though, but that's probably due to the AI, which is entirely dependant on the the surroundings to operate. It just wouldn't work in more open areas I guess.

The plot seems inspired by Asian/Japanese culture and I guess the references to the Ring or Akira are not a coincidence, but the game never goes full weeb, kinda like the Matrix.

One thing to note is that they never over-use the special enemies. The basic soldier squad is used all the way through the game, with some specials here and there ( heavy soldier, robots, turrets, invisible guys, etc ) to keep things interesting, but it's not like in most games where they introduce a new enemy and then use it ad nauseam to replace the ""weak"" ones.

If you have not played this yet then why you been living under a rock :)"
76561198147171783,1582742090,True,"Good tech demo. Not nearly as good a game as nostalgia-blind fans would say. I wish the review system wasn't so binary or I'd put this as a ""Yes, I reccommend it, [i]but[/i]"".

For the record I played on moderate.

The guns are bland for the most part. They were bland then and they're bland now. Not expressly BAD, really, they for the most part deal good damage and aren't frustrating to use, they're just sorta... there. The only exception is the particle lance, which still sounds like it's straight out of a Syfy Original Movie but at least it mitigates the problem of every enemy being able to tank 3 headshots before going down on the 4th and provides some hilarious visuals.

The combat is bipolar. It gives you all the tools and encouragement to play aggressively like you're some kind of John Woo movie protagonist, and that can be fun and rewarding, but then you find out that enemies don't actually lose that much accuracy despite flopping around like an epileptic fish every time you shoot them so they only LOOK like they have hitstun, and furthermore you're way more fragile than you'd think. I need both hands to count how many times I've gone from full health and armor to dead in seconds because they got a lucky grenade hit on me and then shot me twice. Or how many times I've dumped rounds into someone's chest at point blank range just to watch their body flinch and contort but the still manage to shoot me back while their assault rifle is twisting about in one hand.

But if you play more cautiously, taking cover, popping out to take shots, aiming for long-distance headshots, you get even more grenades thrown at you - which, by the way, I'm mostly okay with, that's actually a good behavior for the AI - and there will be times where the particle effects they're so proud of will block your line of sight for tens of seconds.

And, of course, as mentioned, pretty much every enemy is a bullet sponge capable of taking several assault rifle bullets directly to the head before going down. Even the ATC Security pissants will still get a shot or two in on you before you down them unless you're point blank with a shotgun, in which case you've likely already been shot getting there.

The environments are boring. The only thing giving them any character is the lighting and effects, which mostly just reinforces my opinion that this game is a tech demo and doesn't make them any more memorable. I just got finished playing it and I still can't recall a single area in the game that wasn't host to a setpiece. 

Which there are a lot of, by the way. The game loves its setpieces, though to it's credit they aren't usually that much of a pace-breaker since I can't recall them ever taking control away from you for them or change up the controls to something stupid like QTEs. Even the ""cutscenes"" are mostly just you standing there while things happen, and you can still look around and such. Not bad.

And the story? Nobody cares about the story. People who are way bigger fans than me don't care about the story. And this game isn't a horror game, it's just spooky at best, no matter what the tags say or the amount of bloody pools you're dumped into. The only reason you'd care about the story of F.E.A.R. is so that you can compare it to how weird and stupid it got in the sequels.

And even though I complain about some of the wonky bullshit the combat pulls, this game is not hard by any stretch. You can carve a pretty easy path through most of the game because it gives you ample armor, ammo, and so many on-command medkits that you'll end up using one to recover single digits of health just to make room for another one you found, and the slomo mechanic means that only the most instantly fatal circumstances have a chance of catching you off guard. I just found that the only times I died were when the game pulled something weird and counter-intuitive out of it's rear end that felt more like the game just rolled dice and landed on ""give the AI a sudden spike in competency and accuracy for a second.""

All in all, I do recommend it. It's a historically-important game that pushed graphics technology and visual design forwards, it's decent enough to play, and really it's just something fans of FPS should all play through at least once. Just don't go in expecting perfection just because some people will sing its praises until they deafen themselves."

Fear is a great one time play-through game. The suspense during missions is very high and the sounds and animations keep the player on the edge of their seat. The weapons are all very different and useful, The AI enemy is about the most enjoyable to play against, as in they were difficult enough in which any one guy could take you out if you were not paying attention. The layout of the maps are perfect for this type of game, old hotels, factories, etc. The game overall is a rush, however, by the last couple of missions, I was honestly burnt out; I couldn't wait to finish.

The reasons for not recommending: Sh*t didn't age well, alright? First of all, your frame rate is f*cked up from the start. It's fixable but it's still annoying. Secondly, there are god awful game breaking bugs, where your character would either float above the surface he's meant to walk on or completely get stuck in some object, where only spamming crouch would save you (sometimes). At last, the story is.... meh? 80% of the game is bare bone shooting, the plot being kind of diluted and unattractive.

The reasons for recommending? The ending as it ties up the story in quite an appealing matter. The whole story is rather average but in the end, you kind of want to know what happens next. As for gameplay..... it's okay-ish? Nothing special about it, even bumping up the difficulty follows the same pattern as plenty of other games: more difficult = more bullets to kill the guy.

Is it a must play? Nah, not really. Is it appealing in regards to the whole horror-shooting genre? Absolutely."

The series hits a higher point in 2 and slides hard downhill in 3 where it transforms into a generic shooter with bullet sponges and regenerating health. 1&2 are staples of mine for my horror library and be sure to grab the DLCs/expansions/whatever they're called if they're a bundle."

Action packed fight sequences with Bullet Time, and I even found some ammo management and conservation was important especially in the later sections of the game. Some eerie J-horror inspired moments that can either make your hair stand on end, or make you swear you saw something. Or even make you laugh in some circumstances. A solid game. Super Fun."
76561198086510168,1581881861,False,"the way the editor forces you to buy everything including the trashy sequels is awful, hence the ""no"". go find it on another game platform instead. otherwise it sure isn't a waste of time for a shooter fan.

models, textures,animations look a bit aged, environments aren't very varied but the work on sfx (lightning, particles, slowmotion) and atmosphere completely offset it imo. the way you destroy the places during combat is top-notch and the oppressing, paranormal covered op setting is sort of thrilling. musics and sound effects are also pretty competent.

the plot is a mystery unraveled through the campaign and thanks to messages you're free to skip so it doesn't intrude on your playtime too much. beyond that, the story is serviceable but not transcending and the characters while funny at times aren't very developed, especially since you often operate on your own.

horror is a mixed bag: most is script-based and a lot is ""in your face"" trying to take you off-guard. doesn't mean it won't work but there has been more subtle around.

combat is where the game shines like nothing else: weapon coupled with the sfx are punchy to a ludicrous point, the level-design is engaging and superbly puts in action a simple but reactive ai showing more complex than average behaviors, putting modern shooters bad guys to shame. it's however very hitscan-centered; you're very reliant on either slowmo, cover or consuming lot of health packs in your inventory to stay alive, none of which being that skill-indexed. that's more of an in-depth limit for people with very high standards, so if you just want a fun shooter you don't have much if anything to worry about.

in short, the overall package is pleasant and the gunplay is among the best for singleplayer fps. only issue is the way it's sold on steam.
in case you're also interested, there also are two expansions packs:
-Extraction Point is known to have some of the best arenas in the series and a few nice additions. that's a great ramp-up in action and horror but at the cost of a story all over the place.
-Perseus Mandate is on the other hand a step down pretty much everywhere. the new models and the art direction are sloppy at times compared to even the original, plot isn't a good selling point once again, horror falls flat more often, the fights have a few good ideas but the new faction is cringe-inducing and the level design is uninspired especially by the end. its campaign pales compared to the two previous games, and although it has a few, very cool bonus missions, you won't miss much if by any chance you don't buy it."

76561198151525227,1581726698,False,"[h1] It's a not-so-scary horror FPS with great gunplay. Everything else is sub-par. [/h1]

Take this review with a grain of salt... you might feel completely different about this game. This review is a chaotic one but here we go:

The game has a story to tell, but it boils down to spooky encounters that usually aren't that scary. ( especially if you wield a minigun or a rocket launcher! ) Levels can change on some really stupid points and everything feels poorly connected. It is early on explained why soldiers you fight look all the same, they are replicas. What this means is that you will be fighting same type of bad guys during the whole game and that becomes tiring. Later on, swarms of ghosts attack you and that is 0 fun.

Environments look awfully bland, same offices and street walls repeated on and on... add those 2005 pitch black shadows to the mix and you get quite a forgettable set of scenes. Dynamic lighting is a nice touch, some effects like water reacting to movement look quite good but that's about it. Gunplay is the selling point of the game, really. VK12 is a beast of a combat shotgun and it's fun to use - it's without a doubt one of the best shotguns in history of FPSs. I also had some cool moments with the pistol and the Penetrator gun. Unfortunately, combat quickly gets repetitive. That combination of explosive action and slo-mo isn't quite common but i honestly feel the game is overrated. Maybe i'm asking too much for a game that's 15 years old. I dunno.

I admire animations of F.E.A.R. like the ones that happen when you lift yourself up or slide down the rope. I don't know if there was a game to feature such stuff before this one. But now, almost every AAA game has them. On the other hand, normal animations of firing and reloading are done in GTA San Andreas style, all wonky and imprecise, which is not good for an FPS game! Weapon sounds also suck. For some reason both smg and assault rifle are burst on 1 click and auto on hold...

Sometimes i get those nostalgia goggles for the games i played a long time ago. This review is my honest opinion and a reminder that it isn't quite worth replaying (at least not the whole game) in the future. If you want to try it out visit isthereanydeal dot com and wait for a deal, 55$ dollars for the pack is nuts. Looks like someone is exploiting those goggles! ;)"

76561198161345343,1581542634,True,"Overall a great story, functional and fun game mechanics, and decent spooks throughout the game. A good example of a horror/thriller shooter.  9.5/10"
76561198263520519,1581535319,True,"F.E.A.R. and its expansions are all a great experience. The base game can feel a little bit repetitive in areas but it makes up for it in its combat, which always feels great and sometimes I find myself reloading a checkpoint just to do an area over again. The AI are intelligent, for the time anyways, and will call out what you're doing to their allies and react accordingly with flanking, holding position, knocking over objects for cover, etc.

As previously stated, the base game can feel quite bland in areas, it's a water plant for a few chapters, offices in the middle, an abandoned district, and a secret underground lab. While it may seem like it's varied it does start to seem repetitive after playing it for a while. The story is pretty interesting and I enjoyed it, it has a pretty neat twist at the end, but it seems like it takes a back seat to the combat, however it isn't unimportant. The base game is great, but I would say that Extraction Point is better. Also this game has one of the best shotguns ever.

The story is basically, a psychic commando named Paxton Fettel is awoken by a strange girl in a red dress, and he's causing mayhem all around for something (I'm not going to spoil anything for those who haven't played in this paragraph). It's your job as a member of F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) to stop him and his army of Replicas (a clone army) which he commands with his mind. Along the way, you and Delta Force fight ghostly apparitions (commanded by the strange red dress girl), as well as security guards. Basically what seems like some kind of terrorist attack turns into something much bigger.

********/SPOILERS AHEAD/********



[spoiler]Extraction Point takes place after right after the base game, and has you and survivors of Delta Force trying to escape from Paxton (who isn't dead after you blew his brains out) and your mother Alma (girl in red dress and a different form which is older). However, throughout the campaign young Alma is seen helping you with things (my guess is older Alma took control of younger Alma to help her escape which was the ending of the base game, and young Alma was always good).[/spoiler]

********/END OF SPOILERS/********

I would say Extraction Point is a big improvement over the base game in terms of environment. The areas seem more varied and memorable and have more awesome combat sequences. This campaign also seems to focus more on the horror aspect of the game. There also two new weapons in the game, a minigun which devastates infantry and a laser gun which is good at dismembering your foes. There are some new Replicas like the heavy with a minigun, one that holds the laser gun (sometimes), and one in a better version of the mech from the base game, but the real winner is a new apparition called the shade. their are two versions, one that looks all shriveled up and is only used as a scare, and one that's mostly transparent except for their red eyes and will actually try to kill you. The places these guys are set up in actually gave me a scare on my first run through. Also you actually get an ally to help you fight at one part.

Now for the less liked one, Perseus Mandate. Personally, I actually like this one over Extraction Point, but that's just personal preference. If someone says it's better to skip this they're wrong, and I definitely think you should try it. Combat is more or less the same, however there are three new weapons along with the two from Extraction Point. There's a new assault rifle with a scope which is somewhat boring, a grenade launcher which takes a while to master but deals heavy damage, and a lightning gun which bounces from enemy to enemy (like the Wunderwaffe from CoD zombies). There's a new security guard with heavy armor, and a new apparition called the scarecrow which pulls you underground. There's also a new faction called the Nightcrawlers, a mercenary group which is after secrets killing everyone in their way. I would say this story focuses on the combat aspect of the game. In this one you play as a different F.E.A.R. team (which has Steve Blum in it) and are looking for secrets of the company behind this whole catastrophe. This one has Paxton as its main antagonist instead of red dress girl. There's also a secret cutscene after viewing the whole credits that ends with another possible expansion happening (which we never got).

I would say all three are a great experience with great combat and weapons and challenging enemies on higher difficulties. I can't judge the other two games as I haven't played them, but from what I've heard 2 is OK and 3 is garbage. 

Now, I don't recommend buying this game with the package, it's pretty dumb that you can only get it with the other 2. I bought this with a $10 Steam key I found off of amazon which only gave this game and expansions, but if you want to try out the entire franchise it's a pretty good deal then, or you could buy them from GOG separately."

The bullet time effects and the steady but always rising difficulty of the game were amazing and story wise it gets the job done. It also looks great for being an older title with the lighting and shadow effects looking better than some more recent games. The only thing that was a problem for me with this game was that Logitech keyboards and mice drop the frame-rate of this game considerably making it sickening to play. There is a fix only that cures this instantly and after that the game ran smooth as butter. So if you are looking for a competent first person shooter with great bullet time mechanics this is the game for you, with the added benefit of it being at a reasonable price."

76561198067662462,1580711517,True,"TL;DR: Classic horror shooter that has aged really well. 9/10

Firstly, I have played and beaten FEAR three times since its release in 2005, once on Xbox 360 after release and twice on PC. I think that qualifies me to say that FEAR is a horror game inasmuch as the first Die Hard was a Christmas movie (it totally is and scared the fuck out of 10yo me). This game holds up surprisingly well for being 15 years old. The gun play is fantastic, the melee slide and jump kick are satisfying, and the bullet-time works so well that it almost breaks the game (in a good way). The story isn't the best, but then again most FPS games don't have a great story.

Plain and simple, this game is still good, and if you haven't played it yet and are a fan of FPS and horror, you owe it to yourself to try it out."

"
76561198003640818,1580677567,True,"Kinda keeps up with today standards.
Pros:
- Interesting story.
- Somewhat smart AI. They try to hide, flank you and etc.

Cons:
- Unavoidable damage in most cases, so it get really annoying while playing on high difficulties. When you kill an enemy, he usually shoots out half of the magazine during death animation, so if you're close - you're dead. If enemy can't be staggered or oneshot, it will hit you due to high accuracy on high difficulty and you can't prevent that.
- Enemies are bullet sponges. They require 4 headshots from a nailgun, holy hell.
- 3 weapon slots are too little for the variety and varying rarity of the weapons."

Shooting enemies has a nice, satisfying kick to it, and the enemies themselves don't act like sitting ducks waiting for you to get em, they actually move around and communicate with each other. The music is where the game could have improved a lot, and there isn't much music to begin with. The graphics and general look of the game are obviously dated, but they don't fail to immerse me in the game's world nonetheless. This is a definite classic."

The physics are still cool as hell and the slow motion is the badazz icing on the cake. The best part about this game is the gunplay and bullet impact. You feel like you're shredding through flesh and bone when you light up the enemies! It's one of the most satisfying shooting experiences around! The AI is also one of the smartest there is, still to this day. Enemies react to your movements in smart ways, they will flank you and their chatter is often dependent on what is happening in the environment or what you are doing at any given time. Highly recommended for fans of horror or FPS games!

76561198286203843,1580260464,True,Pretty good game. Reminds me of Half-Life and Doom 3 a lot. Gun play is really satisfying and the bullet time mechanic makes for epic gamer moments. I don't like how you can only hold 3 weapons at a time but there aren't that many guns in the game anyway so it doesn't really matter I guess. The game seemed a bit on the easy side even when playing on hard. It's also not very long. It only took me around 8 hours to beat and I was exploring thoroughly inspecting the areas for hidden goods. Still recommend picking the game up. Not on Steam though because for some reason you can only buy this game along with the other games making it around $50.

76561198415945066,1580187156,True,"Hands down the best FPS game I have ever played. In many ways, this is still unmatched with all the new titles that have come out. FEAR was the ""Crysis before Crysis"". Oddly enough, Crysis to me was extremely overrated - a visual spectacle, but gameplay was lacking. 

The Pros:
1. Great graphics. Holds up even today 15 years later (Jan 2020 as of this review)
2. The AI is still unmatched (yes we all know how it works, but still is unmatched). They adapt to your gameplay. Also a lot of reviews miss this - if you reload a save, the AI doesn't behave the same as it did earlier which adds a layer of difficulty to your game. 
3. The gameplay mechanics, physics and the dynamic lighting - never gets old to shoot a hanging lamp to have it change how the light moves in your room. Even gunfights make so much of a difference. 
4. The atmosphere is again unmatched. Several games have tried but this is noteworthy because it balances the eerie atmosphere with the FPS just perfectly. The campaign doesn't ONLY do jumpscares. There are moments when it builds up the scene and you expect something and its nothing, and other moments when you expect nothing and it makes your heart sink. 
5. The weapons in the game are perfectly balanced with their own strengths and tradeoffs
6. Levels are cleverly designed. Although they are linear, they don't take away the atmosphere. 

Cons:
Just wish the other two main games and the Perseus Mandate expansion retained this formula.  

The first game itself is worth it 100% regardless of whether its on sale or not. If its bundled, just buy the whole thing. Its worth it."

76561198176178450,1578849961,True,"F.E.A.R has grown to be one of my personal favorites, when it comes to First-Person Shooters. It combines the action of John Woo's ""Hard Boiled"" with the horror genre such as ""The Ring"" for example. 

The game has been an amazing experience. It has aged very well and still sticks out for a game that is turning 15 years old. It has great scares, advanced physics, and unique details in general. It's beatable within 4-5 hours, but I guarantee you once you play the game you're going to have a great time with it.

Extraction Point is a following to the story line of the main game. Showcasing what happens after the climax of the story. It did good as an Expansion DLC, and worth a play if you want to continue more with the plot. Perseus Mandate in the other hand, felt underwhelming and rushed. The voice lines of the character dialogues and enemy A.I were lazily made. It also contains some bugs, even though they weren't too bothersome while playing the game. The ending was anti-climatic, making it not very memorable compare to the other two.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend picking this up as it's regarded as a cult classic. Unfortunately there is no way to purchase the first game separately, unless you get the whole expansion pack. Purchasing it in another platform will be the only option to do so. But if you're still willing to get the full pack, I suggest to buy it on a sale since it can be too expensive for a full price."

Incorporating a unique AI system that at the time was boosted as the best in the industry, much like the gravity gun the incorporation of voiced dialog with smart AI scripting was F.E.A.R's big talking point months after the game launched. Although the tricks of the game have lost almost all of it's edge with the advancements of technology, the core experience is still their and still worth playing all these years later"

A raid mode would really help I feel to showcase the tight mechanics and AI more as well as get away from the idea of this being horror. Was interesting to have played Quake 4 and Doom 3 prior to this to see the evolution of this idea.

I figured by this time someone would have a fix for this by now, so I Googled for it and found a fix.

76561198161699037,1577486886,True,"F.E.A.R. is definitely a game to get if you are into horror and FPS games.

This game is solidly built. The A.I. is still some of the best in games I've seen. The Slow-Mo ability is very well executed, and Alma has to be one of scariest characters I've had the misfortune of meeting. 

Now, before I go any further, I would like to point out that I got my start in the series from the second game (F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin) on the Xbox 360. From there I went to the third installment (on the same console) and then I came to this game on Steam. With that out of the way, I can continue.

This game isn't just a standard horror-shooter. The story in this game is really well laid out, as long as you pay some attention to the dialog between/from characters, and what Alma has to say/what actions she takes. 

Now, on to the gameplay:

As mentioned before, this game has a Slow-Mo mechanic. It's not unlike a bullet-time mode. It's based off the background that your character has uncannily fast reflexes. In my opinion, this mode is not OP in the slightest. This is mainly due to the fact that it is temporary, doesn't last very long, and must be recharged (it doesn't charge very fast). This mode is mainly used to get out of sticky situations that normally you wouldn't be able to get out of. From my experience, this easily comes in handy in while playing through the higher difficulties. 

Speaking of bullet-time, lets talk about gunplay next. One thing I want to get out of the way immediately: DO NOT EXPECT TO ADS (Aim down sights) IN THIS GAME. That mechanic is reserved for sniper rifles, with a few exceptions. But for standard weapons, it just isn't going to happen. I will admit, this is annoying in the beginning of the game (along with the key bindings). However, you tend to get used to these pretty fast. The guns are well balanced (on normal difficulty and above), and do what you'd expect them to. 

In terms of bugs, I haven't encountered any in the few times I have gone through this world. No clipping through the floor/walls, not weird hitboxes, etc.

Now for the cons:

Some parts of the map can be frustrating (the garage as an example, or maybe I just suck). Sometimes the enemies seem to have an unfair advantage (but not so much that it's infuriating), and ammo can be scarce at times. During those times, grenades are your best friend (along with melee). 

TL;DR

Highly recommended. Great gameplay, good story, and one of the few games that can still scare the living crap out of me. 
"
76561198040240361,1577478982,True,One of the best FPS out there. Grab it on a sale ;)
76561198002168292,1577477833,True,"When I was younger, I always assumed that F.E.A.R. was a horror series that was providing legitimate scares (probably the creepiest coming out at the time). When I first got a PS3 I purchased F.E.A.R. 2 and found that certain parts of it were quite scary and found the combat to be enjoyable. I finally decided to start from the beginning and give the original F.E.A.R. a shot. I have heard several people boast about this game in that it has great combat, while adding creepy moments. Unfortunately, that is not what I got out of this game

[b][u]STORY[/u][/b]
The story of F.E.A.R. involves taking control of Point Man who has just been assigned to the First Encounter Assault Recon team. You are hunting down a man named Paxton Fettel who is wreaking havoc by taking control of supersoldiers with telepathic powers and storming a company called Armacham, killing everyone in his path. You are constantly hunting Paxton, but not progressing towards confronting him until the very end of the game. You make your way through Armacham while slowly uncovering more about Armacham's history, as well as Alma's history. Alma is the little girl in red that is haunting you as you make your way through the game. I was hoping for plenty of scares, but Alma rarely appears as you make your way through. The story intrigued me as it ever so slowly unraveled, but by Chapter 4 or 5 I realized that the game was not going to throw many new things at me. Luckily, the story did ramp up in Act III of the game.

[b][u]GAMEPLAY[/u][/b]
The gameplay features standard first-person gunplay. What makes it stand out is that you can slow down time to land your shots and dodge bullets. There are interesting weapons that you discover that have cool abilities, such as nailing people to walls with the Penetrator, and obliterating them down to bones with Particle Cannons. The base weapons (Pistol, Shotgun, SMG, Assault Rifle) are fine, but are nothing different from the average FPS. I did not implement the melee combat much, but it seemed interesting by offering drop kicks and other midair attacks. Even though I enjoyed the gunplay for a majority of the game, as I progressed further (maybe midway through Act II) I found it to get a little stale. In addition to fights, as you move through the levels there are several laptops that you ""hack"", as well as unread voicemail messages in the offices that you can listen to throughout the game. These often reveal little tidbits about the current attack you are encountering and the past involving Alma and Paxton Fettel.

Another aspect of gameplay to note here are the several cutaways for the story where you get put in brief dream sequences where you walk forward through ""horrific scenery"" to see key story scenes from Alma's past. There are similar sets where you get attacked by ghosts hovering towards you in a dark room set ablaze as story dialogue occurs in the background. I did not get much out of these segments and found them to just pull me out of the game.

[b][u]SOUND[/u][/b]
The music in this game is painfully average. You often hear 5 tracks throughout the story, and one of them is the MENU MUSIC. They do play different tracks when you encounter new enemy types, or when you get thrown into certain types of fights, but for the most part the soundtrack is quite plain. The voice acting is average for the most part, but the person that does the most with what they have is the voice actor for Paxton Fettel. Everyone other character on your team, or who you encounter through the story feature average voice acting.

[b][u]GRAPHICS/VISUALS[/u][/b]
The models and movements are good for the era that this game was released in. The characters look fine, and the guns look good. The settings you play through during the game are plain, boring, repetitive, and lifeless. There were only a few chapters where I found the settings to be slightly above average. The most impressive visual in the game are the[spoiler]invisible soldiers that stick to walls and creep up on you. The invisibility is pulled off well[/spoiler].

[b][u]OVERALL[/u][/b]
I would suggest the game for someone that is looking for different combat from the standard FPS. The combat is entertaining for a moderate amount of the length, but I feel the enjoyment may wear off after a while. If you are looking for a supernatural story but not expecting significant scares, this game will work out well for you. If you are hoping for good scares, don't waste your time as the game has not aged well with that aspect.

[b][u]F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point[/u][/b]
This one was surprisingly a lot better than the base game. I had a way better time with this one in terms of atmosphere, story progression, and gameplay. You work through a subway, a hospital, and an apartment complex rather than just a lifeless office building. The story is more intriguing as you see a lot more of Alma and the supernatural elements, as well as interacting with your teammates. The gameplay introduces a couple new weapons, and enemies as well. This expansion is a bit shorter but I think that makes it better rather than dragging. One thing that bothered me about this expansion was that it picks up immediately where it left off, making the impact of the previous game lesser.

Call this expansion F.E.A.R.:B.S. (BULLET SPONGE). I played this one on moderate difficulty and all of the AI are too accurate, and absorb waaaay too much damage. The story is boring, the environments are boring, and the gameplay is boring. I found this one to be way more frustrating than the base game and the other expansion. The story revolves around a 2nd F.E.A.R. team sent in to help the team from the original F.E.A.R. + Extraction Point expansion. This team, as well as any supporting characters in this game are lifeless boring characters. The story is borderline nonexistent, and the game is all about more firefights. Skip this one as there is no point to it.

The games are not optimized for Windows 10 properly. I had to download a file and put it in the games' program files in order for it to run smoother (Check Steam Discussions for details). On EXTRACTION POINT I had a problem inbetween Interval 04 and loading Interval 05. On PERSEUS MANDATE I had a problem inbetween Interval 06 and loading Interval 07. The game would crash out.

76561198322976564,1577165294,True,"F.E.A.R. is a classic nostalgic FPS game and the most enjoyable back in the day. While later become the most influential FPS now, it was less-received back in the day (especially if you played it on Console back then).

You'll play as Point Man, a special forces Operative investigating a biological/paranormal activity within the grounds and territory of Armacham Technology Corporation, responsible for creating a clone supersoldier the REPLICA based on telepathic communication, controlled by Paxton Fettel, the commander of REPLICA.

You use firearms from pistol, SMG, rifles, nail-gun, plasma gun, shotguns and many many arsenals. You kill enemies from clone soldiers to private security who is tasked to cover up the truth. There is also a ninja and a f@#K!ng ghost, the former you can kill with a claymore. Since you're a special operatives, you can perform Slow-Mo that allowed you to slowdown time, while targeting enemies precisely for a limited amount of time. The game collectables from Laptop and Voice mail to understand the narrative that led to the event of the lore and why F.E.A.R. is dispatched to the situation. Also, don't forget about Health and Reflex injector that scattered around every level to expand your Health & Reflex bar.

Cons, well....the game is really buggy on Modern system. From performance issue that occurred at later time as you progress, key bugs that made you accidentally pressing the screenshot button when pressing ""I"" key and crashes for some scenario. This issue most likely due to the game running on Modern system which can f@#ked up all sorts of sh!t for older games. There are fixes, but too many for me to link. So go to PCGamingWiki or search the Steam Community forums if you wanna see a solution on how you can play it.

There is also an issue that the Steam version is bundle, so YOU ARE REQUIRED TO BOUGHT THE WHOLE G0DDAMN GAME including the expansions, the second and the third game. If you want to avoid such issues because you're running low, I highly recommend that you purchase the game on GOG or wait for it on sale. Also Multiplayer is dead, but there is a community workaround, so...not all hope is lost.

Despite it's being a nostalgic and greatest game back then, F.E.A.R. suffers it's issue in the present day due to gamers has been moving to powerful hardware, unless those who wields a low-end hardware/laptop such as myself, but...go figure. For modern users, there is a BUT/CONDITION on playing the game again, assuming you have time to tweak some stuff before you play.

If what you're searching for is more like the first F.E.A.R. game, this is the expansion you should be looking at.

Extraction Point may not introduce any new weapons or enemies like Perseus Mandate does, but unlike the second expansion, it manages to keep the level of map design of the original game and is also much more faithful to it's atmosphere; but at the same time, while feeling a lot like the normal F.E.A.R. campaign, it doesn't feel like recycled material or too similar to the original game and will actually challenge you in ways that that F.E.A.R. never did in terms of difficulty.

It needs to be said though that for a 2006 game, Extraction Point is EXTREMELY unoptimized and will require fan made patches to work correctly, without them the fps drops and crashes when loading maps make it nearly unplayable at points, so make sure to take care of these problems before really getting into the game."

76561197998062418,1576852594,True,"F.E.A.R. Let's talk about it. 

If you've read my review on F.3.A.R., then you'll know what I'm going to say. It's a game that's made to frighten you, but more than that, it has an evocative story, an interesting (and useful) battle mechanic in that you can ""slow down"" your encounters for a limited time. Fun for the whole family, including Uncle Phil.

The Good: 

Again, the story, the FPS portions, the game in general.

The Bad:

The game has not aged well in a few ways, but those ways are easy to fix. The graphics have seen better days, and a curious glitch makes Logitech devices cause lower than expected FPS rates on modern rigs. Community content here on little ole Steam has addressed both of these things.

TL:DR

I like it, I play it yearly, you'll probably need to patch it. It's fun."

76561198808566155,1576696195,True,"As an old call of duty fan ( the original ww2 call of duty plus the expansion + call of duty two and three) I like a game that has a reasonably good storyline (at least a good reason to blow stuff to smeg and shoot annoying enemies in the crotch), This game has that ( a nice storyline that doesn't require you to run from winterhold to dragonsreach whilst escorting a sheep (slight over exaggeration ) or collect a thousand baby tears and unicorn farts to make a special key to go to the next level where you then have to do it all over again (don't get me wrong, I do enjoy grinding on games (Pervert, get your mind out the gutter) and exploring, however I get bored. Very. Easily, so I like a game like this because whilst it does have some nice time slow abilities and interesting weapons, it doesn't go entirely over the top with the extras (yes I call the ability to slow down time an extra 'cause I like gameplay to be based more on reasonable skill with a slight helping hand than instant god mode but I digress. this game allows you to explore and learn about the backstory of the game while still keeping you from wandering off and helping another settlement or get bored. I has a good atmospheric feel to it and it keeps you on your toes (metaphorically) pretty much all the time. It isn't full on horror but it gives you the feeling that loads of zombies could come flying at you any minute (they don't, just feels like it), so it is a pretty good game to introduce someone to the horror genre. The graphics are dated and feel a little bit old however it is still really good for the time period, it is definitely better than the original halo (combat evolved) graphics wise. The gameplay is pretty smooth, there aren't too many seams, clashes or bugs (so far). All in all a good game for the price. Ps sorry for the text wall"

F.E.A.R. is an atmosphere FPS with quite good graphics in spite of its age. It will run easily on quite old hardware.
Its main positive point is, precisely, its atmosphere: it's a mix of exploration (mainly linear, you won't get lost) tuned to maintain quite a stress level, interleaved with shooting sequences. And it works, at least for a few hours.
On the negative side:
- you will have a lot of laundery to clean your soiled underwears ;-)

"
76561197966299106,1576258643,False,"This game didn't age very well. There just isn't much going on in the story. You show up somewhere, kill a bunch of faceless goons in slowmo, and then do it all over again. The entire game. For 8 hours. 

The fights basically consist of shooting people in the head in slowmo. I put it on the hardest difficulty and it still wasn't that hard. Sometimes you run out of slowmo and you retreat until your meter fills up again. You just stand there for 30 seconds staring at a wall waiting for a bar to fill up. Wtf? 

The main character is a silent protagonist, so not too much you can do with that story wise. There is some stuff about some ghost girl causing problems somehow. The logs relating to it are scattered all over and not well organized. Often I would find one and then someone would start talking over the log or a gunfight would break out and I wouldn't even hear it. There is no way to replay it if this happens. What little plot there is just got flushed right down the drain.

There are a lot of moments when spooky stuff happens but it felt pretty canned most of the time. You see something move out of the corner of you eye, but when you look its gone. Or some boxes move on their own or something. I only had a jump scare like twice the whole game. Annoyingly most ghosts are completely harmless, but then some will kill you instantly. Often the game dumps you into a vision or something that's not real and its hard to know if you should be wasting your bullets or not.

I dunno. Maybe if you really liked the bullet time sequences from The Matrix. I didn't really enjoy it all that much."
76561198199016229,1576124182,True,"Amazing FPS classic that has aged like fine wine.
First off, despite it's name, F.E.A.R. is primarily an action game, and a damn good one at that. That being said, F.E.A.R. has many horror aspects that truly make it stand out among first person shooters. By horror elements, I dont mean cheap jumpscares or gory shock imagery, I'm talking atmospheric horror, you see just enough creepy and unnatural stuff to fill you with a sense of paranoia and dread, even as you are mowing down enemies with an assault rifle. One of the villains, Alma, is also very notable, her terrifying encounters are used sparingly, and a sense of mystery surrounds her, even at the end of the game. The story is also fantastic, managing to be action packed while simultaneously being mysterious and intriguing.

Now on to the action part. First off, F.E.A.R.'s enemy AI is unmatched to this day, and for a game that came out in 2005, that is simply incredible. Enemies are very intelligent, using advanced tactics such as flanking, stealth, sticking their gun out from around corners to spray bullets on you without showing their head (among many other things). Besides the traditional arsenal of modern small arms (your assault rifles, shotguns and what have you) you will also be presented with an array of wackier weapons, such as a stake driver, a triple-barreled rocket launcher, and a shoulder mounted 37mm cannon. Instead of a sniper rifle, you will use the charged particle cannon, which turns enemies into crispy, crunchy skeletons. The bullet-time mechanic is also highly advanced, allowing you to pull off some gnarly combos. Overall, the combat makes you feel like you're in an action movie.
F.E.A.R. is truly a must-play and an experience you will truly remember."

76561198024961383,1575669898,True,"Imagine a game with the level design of Half Life, the combat of a first person Max Payne, the tension of a classic horror game like Penumbra and you have F.E.A.R.

I always struggle to enjoy single player fps games. So when this games environment slowly crept deeper underground and became more industrial, it really reminded me of exploring the Black Mesa compound for the first time. Plenty of side rooms and connected pathways.

Enter the combat. F.E.A.R. did something excellent here, at times feeling like a tactical shooter because of the presentation and pacing of combat. The shooting and animations are by no means realistic, but the moment of coming up on a room full of enemies, peeking the door and popping off only the shots you need to is made incredibly satisfying by punchy and effective guns, as well as the fact that enemies can cut you down as quick as you can do to them. The ai is also fantastic. Never staying in one spot, using those looping pathways to flank and confuse you, and effectively communicating with each other to locate and neutralize you. This would make the combat maybe too difficult if it weren't for the focus ability (monoliths take on bullet time). Many aspects of the combat are obviously inspired by Hong Kong crime action movies. The environments are set up so during gunfights, its inevitable to have exploding fire extinguishers, glass shattering, papers flying and dust getting flung from drywall, all in a bloodshot slow motion effect that makes every shot 10 times more impactful. There have been multiple times where i, for example, am on a catwalk with an enemy underneath. I can decide to hop the railing and take the guy out woth a shotgun while on my way down in slow motion, and it feels as good as the Matrix has always made it look. 

Outside of combat, there is still plenty to be entertained by. You are a silent protagonist, an operative sent in to investigate some strange things going on at a defense tech company. As with many modern military shooters, your partners will often give dialogue to fill in the story, analyzing murder victems and such, but often times these cheesier moments are offset by something much more sinister that only you are witness to. Giving the sense that there is a bigger story here, or a more important one that only you are picking up on, ehile the rest of the soldiers concern themselves with specific objectives or their mission at hand. These moments come in the form of ghostly characters appearing, usually when youre alone, but either way, they are only there to you.

Honestly the best thing i could say for this game is that for an old game, it runs great. I have one mod which is a field of view fix, and i had to tweak an ini file to get my native resolution, but everything else works as it would have upon release (multiplayer is shut down but there are some mods to get it working). And on top of all that, its quite cheap. I bought it on a whim having heard of the series for well over a decade but never pulling the trigger.

In my particular case, I had never played FEAR, but I had known of it ever since it was released. Suffice to say that it had always caught my eye. I've finally taken the time to play it along with its 2 DLC in the span of 4 days.

The positive is the AI of the game truly holds up to today's standards and I believe even better than some AAA companies. They should be taking note.

Unfortunately, I wouldn't say FEAR holds to today's standards and technology (obviously). It would be unfair for me to criticize it that way but it should be mentioned so that people who would like to play FEAR are fairly warned. In those regards, those who are using Windows 7 and beyond...this game is not properly optimized and will never be because it has been abandoned. This is the final product and the game causes a lot of errors with these operating systems. GAME BREAKING errors. I had to dig so deep in the web to be able to find solutions to these problems, and one I couldn't solve so I needed to jump to the next level through console commands. 

I can see why it was so big in its time. Pacing is not that good and the scares are meh for today's standards.. The few couple of times I got scared was because of an enemy appearing behind me without me realizing it. It had great concepts and great wtf segments to cause the player to be scared that I feel The Evil Within might've gotten some inspiration from here.

I would highly recommend this game for anyone that is new to the series. It may be old but it's still definitely gold standard"

For example; the scarcity of grenades makes it more fun to actually use them. The scarcity of horror moments makes them more intriguing when they sporadically show up. The way Fear holds your attention by smart gameplay diversity and an ever building up feel of tension laying underneath.. 

The level design is superb and fits a 'hallway shooter' like this one perfectly. Another great aspect of this game: the mood the soundtrack brings about. The eerie set of synth sounds, even more so because of its provoking simplicity, resonates with the way the game looks and feels. The mechanics, the character progression, the way you find info to learn more and more about Alma's tragic life story.. It all fits one another just right. I could go on for a long while talking positively about this game. It's awesome, it's an FPS statement."

The combat is very satisfying with a system similar to max payne where you can slow time to get the upper hand or simply to look cool. Guns feel satisfying to use especially the shotgun. There is also some melee moves you can preform which is a nice touch. The game also has really nice physics. The ai is incredibly intelligent and you can tell there was alot of effort put into it. Enemies will try to flank if you stay in one spot for too long if they have a route, hide in fear if you are dominating them, or just make intelligent logical choices to survive unlike todays ai where you can tell graphics are the only focus. Speaking of graphics they still hold up pretty well in this game. There is a nice horror element i've never really seen in a fps action game like this. Atmosphere and story are top notch as well. Definitely going to play the sequels."

76561198273242289,1573493468,True,Defenitly a good mix of Horror and FPS that is fun and intersting

76561198012511360,1573430690,True,"Great FPS. I love the dynamic firefights where the enemy does squad callouts and it always surprises me where the enemies end up flanking me or grenading my behind. The selection of weapons is pretty good too, although I find the game always throws the assault rifle towards you. My only real qualm with the gameplay is that the difficulty (on hard mode) can be extremely difficult at the start, then extremely easy near the end when you have all the upgrades. Other than that, this is a fantastic dynamic shooter which will be refreshing for anyone playing FPS that all feel the same.

Everything else was pretty meh. Story was alright, but feels very prolonged and call-of-duty-like where you just go through building to building running and gunning and then hit F on a keyboard once in a while."
76561197998626572,1573429932,True,"I remember playing this game back when it came out, and it was ahead of its time. Replaying it now was still a lot of fun, although it's not perfect.

[b]First the good:[/b] 

The gunplay is phenomenal, and shooting most weapons is very satisfying. Some, like the rocket launcher and rotating cannon lack umph, but when you handle the shotty, or AUG, you really can't get enough of it. 

The enemy AI is not bad at all. They'll react to noise, your flashlight, and catching a glimpse of you. They're also really fucking good, even on normal difficulty. This is one game in which you can't just waltz through, popping heads and picking up collectibles. Your typical 3-man enemy squad, while incredibly simple to take down if you're on your toes, [i]will kill you[/i] if you stop to reload in the open, or otherwise catch you off your game. They will flank. They will take cover. And they have really good reaction times.

The game builds the atmosphere really well, and the creep factor is off the charts in some areas. Play this in the dark, with noise cancelling earphones, and you will really get in the spirit of things. Alma is one sinister little girl, and some scenes were masterfully done.

The characters and dialogue are not bad, although you never really get to know them. The level design is really good, with more than one path leading you to your objective, and having the option to bypass or flank enemy ambushes.

[b]The not so good (some spoilers ahead) :[/b]

The graphics are obviously dated. The maps are well made, as to not be too small, or boring, but holy f**k do you do a lot of walking. And your character only moves at one speed - a very slow jog. Combined with the hidden boosters, and intel, you will get very frustrated trying to explore every nook and cranny, as I did.

Additionally, you have to wade through way too many enemies. Most of them are just as easy to kill at the end of the game as in the first 5 minutes, the only challenge is that they're really good, and there's rather more of them. It took me 9 hours to finish the campaign, but I feel like the sweet spot would have been 6-7 hours. By the end I was getting reckless because I just wanted to get it over with. 

Although you're constantly finding out more and more sinister things about what happened to Alma, the main character remains silent, and even the handler doesn't really comment on the supernatural events taking place. The two recurring characters - Jin and a Delta Force dude - see some pretty freaky sh!t, but don't seem particularly perturbed. This is a little bit immersion breaking, as no one seems to be taking the revelation that a malevolent, dead psychic is trying to bring about the apocalypse seriously enough. 

The revelation that the Point Man is Alma's son is also made pretty early, but nothing much is done with this information. Really, the Point Man could be any enhanced soldier, and the story wouldn't change one bit, because Alma still tries to kill him, and he would still try to stop her. Similarly, no one stops to ask how in the heck this guy keeps walking away from situations where entire special forces teams are wiped out. A few lines of dialogue could have solved all that.

In the end, the game is pretty good, if a little grindy. Worth experiencing, if for no other reason than that it's better than some modern AAA titles for only a fraction of the cost."

[b] A Solid Shooter With Some Of The Best A.I. In Any FPS [/b]

[b] F.E.A.R. [/b] is by no means a perfect game. The story is pretty lame, there are issues getting the game to run, and the level design for the latter half of the game can get repetitive. Yet, the game is still good due to its gritty combat, highly immersive A.I., and a fantastic engine combined with great sound design to make every fight leave its mark on the world. 

The combat in this game is pretty good, with an assortment of weapons that pack a serious punch. There are shotguns, pistols, machine guns, railguns, and even an energy weapon thrown in the mix. Each weapon feels like it is suited for a specific scenario as well, forcing you not only to move between cover to get a better position but also makes you switch weapons depending on the level you are in. The shotgun feels especially amazing, and is one of the best in video game history due to how much damage it can do to both the enemies and the environment. 

The A.I. is what gives this game its legacy however. Each encounter with the enemy, especially on the highest difficulties, feels dangerous, and leaves you with a plethora of options on how to approach the fight. If you are aggressive, enemies will retreat and try to hide in order to flank you around corners. If you decide to hug cover, enemies will swarm your position from different angles, as well as chuck grenades in order to flush you out. This is matched with the genius voice work done for the enemy super soldiers, where they communicate with their squad and exclaim what their next move will be. It makes fights tense and unpredictable, which is rare for a shooter from 2005, nonetheless any shooter that is normally released. Despite being simple in its code, the developers were smart in how they wanted to create a combat system.

Finally, the game engine and sound design enhance the combat to make it feel what I would call ""gritty"". Every blast from a pistol has power behind it, a sub-machinegun shrieks with firepower, and the shotgun literally tears the environment (as well as enemies) into powder. Bullet holes litter the environment, limbs and heads fly off depending on the angle shoot at, and ragdolls cause enemies to fling around due to powerful explosions or high speed nails penetrating their bodies. It's magnificent, and gives claim to the game being the ""Crysis"" before [b] Crysis [/b]. I loved the combat in this game to death, and I wish more modern shooters took these physics and sound design quirks and added them into their games. 

The game isn't without its faults: The latter half of the game becomes a slog in a way, purely held up by its combat but failing to diversify its environments from anything other than office complexes. Additionally, the story is very poor, and the motivation behind the murdering of hundreds of soldiers is lost in the process. Lastly, the game was very difficult to run, with constant crashes occurring during tweaking of settings, and the framerate suffered heavily due to an issue with HID-compliant devices (disabling these devices through the Device Manager seemed to work amazingly). Still, this game managed to delight me with its shooting mechanics and combat, and as a big fan of shooters, it was a breath of fresh air. 

I would heavily [b] Recommend [/b] this game to every shooter fan out there, because even with a lackluster story, performance issues, and repetitive level design, at the core of [b] F.E.A.R. [/b] lies one of the best combat systems ever implemented in a FPS.

[h2] Final Verdict: 7/10 (Good) [/h2]

76561198059789070,1573369341,True,very good game reminded me of far cry
76561198077715261,1573307592,True,cool game
76561198088028147,1573279765,False,"This game aged really poorly, somehow this game is about 7gb to download and it is inexcusable for it to have such low quality graphics. I'm playing this on virgin slayer 12 year old elite gamer highest quality. Firstly there is no controller support unless you put this or that software in it. Yet the game says ""Controller support"". I'm sorry if you're going to CONTINUE to take money for a game at least put controller support, if not mark it as free. I should not have to go get some third party app to do it. 

the main menu feels cheap and put together fast
it's similar to timeshift by Sierra and  Vivendi Games where every enemy is a bullet sponge 
they are quite cheap on ammo 
the first time I played the game even before seeing the first menu the game crashed 

Now I could play a lot of FPS games with a mouse and keyobard but the way the mouse is programmed kills anything left of an experience. You move left or right way too quickly and no matter how you tweak the sensitivity of the mouse it won't fix every axis where it should handle.

the ""stealth"" sneaking behind enemies is hilarious it feels like when I used to play timeshift on ps3 online against people new to the series. The overall aiming and so forth of it needs serious work. The briefing menu before every mission reminds me of really old PS1 games. 

the levels I played were boring and uninspired

the voice acting goes from good to enemies in the levels that seem like drunk men playing outside with static walkie talkies where they batteries are about to die from a garage sale 

I had more fun playing Bioshock 1 or 2, the darkness 2 which came out around similar times, well, it's on sale, otherwise don't waste your time on this one paying full price unless you're living in the past and just marking funny for games that you had good memories of playing growing up and haven't touched since. It's not worth it."
76561198120907742,1573270158,True,"Great game for the classic horror fan. Not only does it include many classic horror tropes, but great gunplay and fantastic A.I.! Would totally recommend to anyone who has played Half-life or Doom!"
76561197991202316,1573253762,True,"GAMEPLAY: A fun tactical shooter which seems to also have some horror elements. It was fairly linear, but well designed. Finding upgrades felt mandatory and not optional. The enemies felt like an actual challenge. Too bad there wasn't a whole lot of variety of enemy types. 
STORY: The story was interesting, but not exactly original. You will most likely see the twist coming fairly early one. Unfortunately the rest of the series stays on this plot line and did not explore new concepts. 
CHARACTERS: The characters were pretty flat. With the exception of Bishop, who got one scene that did make me laugh."
76561198015292616,1573206966,True,"One of the greatest FPS games of all time. While relatively short what it provides in length is more than made  up for with depth. Even in 2019, the A.I. of this relatively old game is second to none. They will actively use cover, grenades to flush you out, and flanking manoeuvres all to great effect. And most of all you will be able to hear them use combat comms while engaged with you. This may take the form of issuing orders to other members of their squad to outflank you, swear at you,and express surprise at the demise of one of their own. The combat of this game is also first rate. You have a plethora of weapons to use throughout the game and all are useful. All have top-notch noises when firing them and all display good recoil (Not too much, not too little). To add on to this, the dust and particles that get kicked up when a firefight happens is fantastic, at times there is so much dust that you can't even see the enemy. Rounds fired will leave indents on objects and carve out pieces of walls in the environment. The story and horror of the game is also fantastic. Especially on an initial play through you may get surprised by the horror elements. All in all, this is a game that has to be experienced by any FPS fan or gamer in general."
76561197981260160,1573173275,True,This is a brilliant game and is still better than many of today's first-person shooters. The story is of a depth rarely seen and fluidly unfolds through gameplay without pulling the player out of the action and into cutscenes and static dialogue.

76561198156213501,1572908933,True,Arguably one of the best shooters out there. F.E.A.R. is a lot less about the horror elements and a lot more about what happens when simplistic ideas and designs flourish. It also helps that the level design and AI complement each other extraordinarily well. No two fights are the same and the slow-mo lets you end fights before they start if you time it right.

76561198050988070,1572655329,True,"Spooky game, but the action is so intense and off-the-wall I forgot to get scared sometimes. I guess having bullet-time reflexes will do that to your brain.

The story can be vage at times. Reading loading screens, listening to voicemails and collecting data from specific laptops are quite useful things to do if you want to get the whole picture. This isn't really necessary of course, it's a very straight forward plot after all, but going out of your way to find those extra pieces of context definitely helps enriching the experience even if just a little bit.  

The spooks and frights department is alright, they pulled all the stops no doubt but it's clear that the point of the game is battling the relentless Replica Forces, no matter how many girls from The Ring they put in the cover. Those cloned bastards will do everything and anything in their power to kill you on the spot, displaying remarkably smart AI and attention to detail while doing so.

As for the expansions, Extraction Point is a direct continuation of the main campaign. New enemies, weapons and even crazier visuals and set pieces. A high quality expansion. Perseus Mandate on the other hand, not as enjoyable, it's just more of the same at this point. While it has some very creative and creepy parts, boring levels and annoying enemies that won't die even if you shoot them in the head point blank with a shotgun didn't do this expansion any favors.

The visual effects with every shot giving such a weight and flair above most, so many dust clouds, so many bullet holes in the wall. The enemies are the best group of baddies that can be seen....the a.i. will call you out at about anywhere if they see you, your flashlight, or hear your weaponry and organize to kill you, also play on the highest difficulty, sometimes it'll be unfair...but the baddies make it worth. The story is fine, i'd rather not say more. The sounds of the weaponry has a real nice bass behind it, with the power of a shot being backed up with its stats too. Bit buggy which is usually solved by lowering graphics apparently or is just collision weirdness. A complete package...expansions are optional...and are meh. In short Great game play, extremely good presentation, horror john wu, tho the horror is not much a focus, worst part about the game is you have to buy  it in a pack with the other games...and the others just don't come close.

Original post:

One of the best action-horror games I've played in a long while. The story is a bit confusing, but the game is sure to give you some scares and you will feel the tension along your journey if you play with headphones on (the audiowork is very good !) 

You will spend most of your time shooting, but the game gives you a wide variety of weapons to do so, and shooting in this game is really fun. The weapons feel real; if there's an explosion near you, you will stumble and your aim gets all jiggly. If you try to shoot while jumping/running, the aim will get a little messed up, and you will have to deal with lots of recoil. You also have slow motion in your arsenal (like bullet time from Max Payne), and let me tell you: it's beautiful. You see individual bullets flying around you as you try to dodge them and still hit your targets. Shoot an enemy at point-blank range with a shotgun and you will see his limbs detach from his body, and particles of dust and concrete will fly up as your bullets hit a concrete wall, leaving a hole in it. The attention to detail holds up pretty well, even by today's standards !

The enemies will give a hard time if you play on higher difficulties, and there's a lot of different types of enemies. Their AI is really good; They communicate with each other and some will try to distract you so others can flank. The level design is also very well thought-out, as it allow for easy flanking tactics and setting up room for you trapping your enemies; and the other way around too, they will set up a trap if they see fit ;)  

If you have some extra bucks to spare, this is definitely a game worth picking up."

8/10"
76561198035356224,1571632449,True,"F.E.A.R. is one hell of a first person horror experience.

Monolith has always released absolutely terrific games, even if some of them have been underwhelming [SHOGO, Blood 2 getting fucked in the ass]. F.E.A.R. doesn't try to do too much crazy stuff, but given that it was released in 2005, a western developer mixing Japanese style Psychological horror with Western First Person elements was and still mostly is unheard of, even today.

You've got a whole arsenal of weapons to choose from, and you can carry 3 at a time. Some assault rifles, smgs, shotgun, pistols, a nail rifle, etc. All of them are unique and fun to mess around with, and are great in their own situations.

The real meat of this game is the enemies you fight. No-name clone soldiers. It's how they function that really still blows me away, even in 2019.

Like all Monolith games, you are a glass cannon. Even on lower difficulties, you can't take too many point blank shots from anything before dying. Your enemies are going to do everything they can, diving through windows, jumping down from railings, flushing you down choke points, and some literally go lone wolf while you are focusing on their buddies to go through empty rooms you've already cleared out to come from behind and kill you. This game was released in 2005, and even now a days not many shooters have this much attention to detail in the ai. F.E.A.R.s enemies are very much alive. They will communicate with each other, spot you using your flashlight, and then devise a strategy against you depending on where you are and when they got alerted. 

Hiding on the second floor? That's alright, they have grenades. Kill a group and think your safe? Last one will go silent and fake you out only to follow you closely along to surprise ambush you for revenge. Enemies can climb jump and vault all around you, and it's always just you vs them. Plan accordingly.

The scares in F.E.A.R. may seem stock or generic by todays standards but it'll still find ways to get under your skin. Again this did come out at the end of 2005, but the cerebral approach to the horror laid foundations for plenty of games down the road.

F.E.A.R. is an absolute classic Masterpiece. It turns 20 in 2025, and that's just crazy to me. Monolith still exists but they haven't done a FPS since F.E.A.R. and it's honestly sad. 2 was an attempt to add more to the formula but added too much action. 3 did the same thing Dead Space did and added coop, which completely watered down the horror aspects. Nothing compares to the original, and you can only get it in the F.E.A.R. Collection on steam, which is always 60 dollars, but on GOG, the game is 9.99 for F.E.A.R. 1 and it's expansions. 

Absolute classic horror masterpiece."
76561198044888590,1571627513,True,"A VERY solid shooter. Not so much a horror game, but it definetly has horror elements. FEAR spends most of it's time in combat and it leaves it's horror scenes and combat completely separate. I wish there was more horror, but ultimately I enjoyed the shooting."
76561198142904979,1571624966,True,"Still a great shooter, with fantastic AI.

The levels are a bit boring looking and samey, and the spoooky story is a bit flat, but this is well paced and fun. Yes, there's a few enemies who are a real pain, but the difficulty level is pitched perfectly. The graphics are good enough that it doesn't detract from the game.

Weapons feel great. Pretty standard setup, but shooting is tight, and no piece feels redundant. Very effective shotgun + slomo = oh boy!
AI puts modern games to shame. They suppress, flank, try to stay out of player's sight when not shooting.
Lights/shadows is something else. They're not just for immersion, but can warn you about enemy. Oh yeah, AI can spot your flashlight so keep it off when approaching them.
Very little feels scripted to limit player, almost entire game is organic gameplay. Cutscenes happen between levels.
Spooks are rather uninteresting, but you don't fight them until final part of game, which is kind of meh anyway"
76561198027102438,1571082645,True,"Bottom line: Like shooters? Please do play this one. Not really into FPS? consider skipping.

Short version:
+Terrific AI results in a good FPS
+Relatively good compatibily to modern systems
+Still relevant to today's gaming standards
+OK sound design, soundtrack has its moments

+\- Not that scary
+\- The EPs didn't get much praise, but personally, I felt they actually make up for a slightly better experience overall - there's a bit more story, some smarter scares than the original, some variance in atmosphere and surroundings

-Extremely linear
-Surroundings are oh so repetitive
-Thin plot
-The experience in general can feel rather monotanous



Long Version:
As I'm already through FEAR, Extraction Point, and near the very end of Perseus Mandate, I think I'm eligible for writing a review.
This is a good game, no doubt. If shooters is your thing, that is.

I myself made a slight mistake with FEAR - I've been wanting to play list for a long time. I didn't know much about the game besides the famous creepy girl and that it's a shooter, but being the story hog that I am I was hoping the experience would be somewhat tending to the direction of psychological horror and story-based-ish.

As soon as I launched the game for the first time and figured that FEAR stands for First Encounter Assault Recon I had a feeling that I was wrong (And as of today that feeling was right).

What's beautiful about FEAR is that it actually aged quite alright. Running it on modern system would require some tweaking (which is forgiveable, almost 15 years after release), and technically the game works alright and the graphics look relatively fine.
FEAR's AI remains one of the best to be seen even today, and is definitely the highlight of the game.
There are some different kinds of enemies in the game (not that much, mind you), and with most of the the combat is always challenging and usually fun, as the AI isn't stupidly predictable and enemies can even put some clever teamwork to beat you up, and would sometimes even just make you do the first move yourself.

Now this is all very remarkable and if FPSs are your cup of tea you may enjoy the game pretty much.

As for me, I'm NOT that type of guy. While I'm still convinced that this is a good SHOOTER, I do believe that besides the splendid AI it falls to the trap of being too much of everything else that's a completely generic FPS -
The story is there alright but it really isn't that much of anything, even though it feels they really tried but..... I felt it ended up being a rather thin plot besides some selected key moments.

The level design is very, VERY repetitive, so is the atmosphere and general surroundings around you. And it does get boring.
It's extremely easy to distinguish between areas which are meant to be ""scary moment"", areas which are intended to be ""battle grounds"" and areas which are just ""tunnles"" between the former two under the disguise of some narrow industrial-ish corridor.

This becomes tiring quite fast and soon enough all that's left is the gunfights you'll keep having, as the only substance the game has to offer, pretty much.
And then again, if you ARE into shooters, you should be satisfied.

As for the Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, from what I've read they didn't get as much praise, and yet I believe they're actually better than the original.
FEAR without a doubt lays the foundation for what COULD BE a good shooter which is ALSO interesting and has more intriguing features besides being JUST a good shooter.
In my opinion, the expansion packs, while still suffering from the same symptoms I've mentioned above, manage to lift the general experience slightly - there's finally SOME variation in the various ""landscapes"" you're running through while shooting your enemies to death. Yes, there are still many offices and sewers but there's a little more to it.
The plot is still rather thin but here there's actually a little more to it as well, you actually feel a little bit of character around you and there's more story progression within the game and not just the first&last 10 minutes.

The scares, which I haven't mentioned by now, are said by many to be ""cheap jump scares"", but personally I thinkg they were cleverly done in the EPs and managed to create some actually unsettling moments, unlike the original FEAR where I felt the scares weren't always that much of scares...."
76561197981595935,1570981294,False,"Unfortunately doesn't live up to my memory of it.

The story is the usual thing about secret experiments gone wrong, and the test subject is on a psychic rampage. The spoopy element is so generic and hammy that, a bit like Dead Space, it's more there for fun than to actually spoop you. It has no bearing on the gameplay until the last 10 minutes, where you have to fight ghosts that move linearly towards you like a Unity tutorial game. The music is as generic as the rest of the game, consisting mostly of waterphones and dark ambient sounds.

The fighting is most fun when you're against human enemies who move quickly from place to place, sometimes rushing you and sometimes holding back and forcing you to make the first move. The slowmo mechanic sort of ruins this though, as it makes it really easy to pop out of cover and pick off everyone in your line of sight before they can react. All the other combat encounters are some kind of slow, chunky damage sponge that doesn't use cover, or a melee enemy that just runs towards you.

The weapon variety isn't great either - you have 3 or 4 weapons with usable amounts of ammunition for 90% of the game. When you do get a heavy weapon, you feel compelled save it just to dump all the ammunition into the next damage sponge enemy.

The lighting and visual effects are great for 2005, and they really make use of it to create a moody and foreboding atmosphere. Unfortunately the rest of the game is just too monotonous for me to recommend it.

I want to give special mention to Norton Mapes, who's a recurring character in the game. His entire character is just that he's a fat dumb nerd who sexually harasses his coworkers and leaves wotsit packets everywhere (also he has a giant belt buckle that says RTFM). It's such a bad attempt at comic relief that it makes you wish he was just another joyless NPC."
76561198121086817,1570946337,True,"The best in the series, the main game itself is amazing and love the dark story that most games today in the Industry lack. I played this game with a crack to see if I would enjoy it before buying it and ended up buying the whole bundle and play again. Lighting and gun play are testaments to time. If I were to list the FEAR games from best to worst it would be like this.      *F.E.A.R.
*Extraction Point (DLC 1)
*F.E.A.R. 2
*F.E.A.R. 2's DLC
*Persus Mandate (DLC 2)
*F.3.A.R. (Decent CO-OP game bad F.E.A.R. game)

At least play FEAR 1, Extraction Point, Fear 2, and its DLC."

F.E.A.R. is frightening.  Whether or not that's a good thing depends on the moment of play.

[b]DISCLAIMER: THIS REVIEW DOES NOT EVALUATE MULTIPLAYER MODE DUE TO SERVER SHUTDOWN.[/b]

[h1]Story[/h1]
Set in the year 2025, players take control of the Point Man, a soldier working for America's covert First Encounter Assault Recon team; a military branch specialized in paranormal threats to national security.  F.E.A.R.'s narrative threat is a laughably absurd situation involving a corporation that has lost control of a man they've been experimenting on to turn into a psychic commander that can telepathically control well over a thousand armed and trained clone soldiers; which also just so happen to be at battalion strength and have been standing around in hangars waiting for activation.  ATC HQ, located in the city of Fairport, has gone dark and Fettel, the commander, was last seen leading a detachment to some sort of old hospital.  Almost all of the rest of the story is a wild goose chase as Fettel moves from one part of the city to the next while the Point Man tries to catch him.  On its own this would make for a terrible and silly story but thankfully, F.E.A.R. has something much darker and more interesting buried in the shadows of its story.  As players explore, they'll come across messages on answering machines and unlocked laptops that slowly drip feed more and more information on Fettel's creation and what sorts of things ATC has been up to.  It's genuinely interesting and creepy stuff and while the story ends on a disappointing but bombastic cliff hanger, it at least manages to tell an interesting background story that shoves its way into the fore.  These bits can be missed of course, and F.E.A.R.'s twists and turns are in danger of being ignored entirely because of this, but they're usually easy enough to find that it isn't an issue.  If you come in expecting characters, don't.  No one is very personable or relatable.
Also included in the game are Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, two expansion stories that add to the F.E.A.R. narrative, but they don't add much.  Extraction Point spends almost all of its run time following the Point Man as he tries to get to an evac point.  A lot of what happens in it is nonsense that will never be explained.  Perseus, meanwhile, takes place near the end of F.E.A.R. and on into the beginning of Extraction.  As a different F.E.A.R. operative, players are raiding a separate ATC facility to get their hands on valuable intel but soon find they're not the only highly armed team making such a move.  Mandate also confuses the narrative a bit by interlinking characters that really have no business interacting with each other.  Both these two expansions, like the main campaign, end on cliff hangers.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
F.E.A.R. is a bog standard first person shooter with one good twist that carries the title's gameplay: slow-mo cinematic gunfights.  Not scripted, mind you, but fights unfold in such a visually and audibly appealing manner that they're almost poetic forms of combat.  Dozens of bullets leave rippling trails in the air behind them.  Explosions send out visible shock waves that hurl objects, debris, and people in all directions.  Shotgun blasts can rip men in half as their two parts fly in opposite directions.  Even something as simple and basic as an SMG sprays blood in every direction while the bullets pierce through soldiers to slam the wall behind them and kick up huge gouts of dust and smoke.  It helps that pretty much every weapon in the game, even the handgun, just feels and sounds so satisfying to use.  Point Man can carry three of them as well as up to four types of grenades.  The game also features a surprisingly robust melee system with humorous but deadly bicycle kicks and leg sweeps.  Unfortunately it isn't always a good time.  Time between fights can sometimes become drawn out too long and this can feel like time is stretching out even further due to the highly unappealing and repetitive environments the game offers.  Exploring the same cubicle or sewer tunnel can be mind numbing as you scavenge for supplies and permanent buffs to your health and slow-mo meters.  One of the biggest enemies you'll face is your flashlight.  It has a rather small battery which will keep you constantly turning it on and off to recharge.  While this is good tension building for the first hour or so, it quickly becomes an aggressively annoying chore that is made all the more aggravating by the fact that when the game does try to scare you, it disables your flashlight anyways.  Perseus is kind enough to double the light's run time, but still requires a recharge all the same.  Enemies in F.E.A.R. are interesting but mostly harmless on the medium difficulty.  They limp when injured, can turn to fire their weapon one handed as they run away from you, and do much much more.  They don't really stand a chance against a man who can see time in slow motion, but the way they react and fight makes them entertaining enough even on the less challenging difficulties.  EP and PM seem to purposefully increase the difficulty somewhat, mostly by making damage negating armor more scarce, but also by introducing some rather annoyingly bullet sponge tier enemies as well.  Perhaps the only thing holding back F.E.A.R.'s gameplay from being full blast entertainment is the highly clunky and restrictive movement, which feels a league behind its quality shooting and effects.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
F.E.A.R. has its ups and downs.  Environments and animations are easily its lowest points with samey and mundane looking surroundings and stiff, misaligned, and often low effort movements and reuse of animations.  Environments do have nice, crisp textures at a moderate distance, and while these fall apart on closer inspection; they look great during gameplay.  Lighting is a big bullet point for the game and its stylistic use of hard, solid black, and sharp edged shadows is very striking.  Strangely, although many things can cast shadows including muzzle flashes and bullet tracers, your own flashlight can not, of all things.  Enemy and equipment design is rather subpar and uninteresting with only a couple standout designs.  The horror in the game is primarily of the tense discomfort building kind, which lends itself a constant feeling of unease with mind bending hallucinations and genuinely creepy moments.  This is bolstered by what is really not a soundtrack at all, but rather a soundscape of droning, shifting, ambient noises, patterns, and rhythms.  Physics can be a bit wild but this ultimately adds to the experience more than it takes away.
On the technical side of things, the game's checkpoint saves are highly jarring as they instantly turn the screen a solid black for a few seconds before resuming play, or maybe this is just some sort of attempt at horror by scaring me into thinking my PC crashed.  The expansions also had the very strange issue of failing to load a level due to a server disconnect, which is fascinating as the campaigns don't connect to a server in the first place.  Beyond these issues however, the game is solid."

76561198041318077,1570341040,True,"For a game going on 14 years old, I was impressed with how well it still holds up. Combat was frantic and exciting with how intelligent the enemy A.I. still is, not to mention the bullet time mechanic really makes this games combat something special. Graphics were STILL nice to look at, with a few rough spots (namely some faces and textures). Sure, it's not going to blow you away now but for something this old to still look decent is always a positive. 

Story was a bit weak, but didn't really detract from the overall enjoyment for me personally. The greatest negative, however, is the bland and repetitious environments that frequently left me thinking ""Wait..have I been here before?""

Overall, I would recommend it if you see it on sale. Well worth the couple of bucks I spent!"

Came back to it after 11 years (more or less ) to redeem myself, this game used to spook the hecc out of me when I was little. After all this time , I still remembered some scenes and when they were supposed to happen, that's how memorable this game is. Nowadays it managed to take me by surprise only 2 or 3 times ,it's hard for me to get scared by any movie or game lately, but even so FEAR has a perfect mix of atmosphere and ""jump scares"". 

Everybody's talking about the A.I. , indeed it is capable of ""thinking"" and taking decisions, other than charging head on at you (for example , flanking, throwing grenades , circling around your back etc.) but these things shine only on a difficulty higher than normal , because in my opinion normal is quite easy and a fight with the enemies usually is short so the A.I. doesn't really get to show what it is capable of.

This game and its expansions look good for their time , the base game even has 1080p resolution support , even though the expansions do not, for whatever reason.

As far as the story goes , it is really good , I would go as far as to say that FEAR is a must play for anyone who hasn't played it already. (if you are not squeamish or easily scared ,that is xD )"

My gripe is with the expansion packs. The first one, Extraction Point is everything an expansion pack should be. Expands on the original, offering new locations, weapons and enemies. However it is awfully optimised. I'm getting 5-10 FPS on a 2060 card in places. Also getting a very annoying error where certain saves won't load. I keep getting a ""out of memory"" error. Patch it, unacceptable."
76561198005650121,1569880572,True,"F.E.A.R. is an incredible FPS that absolutely deserves it's status as a cult classic staple of early 2000's PC gaming. You've doubtlessly heard about the AI being incredible, but it's less likely you've heard about the fantastic level design that works *with* the AI as opposed to simply being something the AI and player navigates through; the amazing particle effects and details in the environment that can give away an enemy position, and paint the walls of whatever cubical you're fighting in red with blood. 

It's really just goddamn fun to play. They got the gameplay loop in F.E.A.R. down so well that it could pass for a Nintendo game. It looks pretty good for it's age too - the lighting (and the developers use of it particularly) is fantastic. Also, grudge girl kinda spooky ngl. 

TLDR; Easily stands up with the best of the best for FPS games, AI/level design/sound/lighting/gunfeel are all stellar. Kinda spooky. Highly recommended."

If you enjoy over the top action with spooky supernatural elements, you'll love this game.
The bullet-time mechanic plays a huge part of the game, you'll be using it 90% percent of the time.
It can really help you get out of some sticky situations. 
Playing the game on the hardest difficulty is a must, because you really have to utilize the slow-mo.
And it feels very satisfying to just barely survive encounters with enemies. 

In my opinion, this is the most atmospheric shooter I have ever played. Every time I play through it, it sill always gets under my skin. And that's really saying something.
The soundtrack is an absolute masterpiece, and one of the most underrated. It really fits with this game.

The story is also quite entertaining, and will keep you anxiously wondering what will happen next.
The game as a whole will constantly make you feel anxious.

Aiming and movement feels precise and snappy, and WOW how everything flows because of that. With some experience, you'll be hopping in and out of ""bullet time,"" out-maneuvering the impressive AI enemies and kung fu kicking them in their faces. As many have already mentioned, even the graphics, especially for a 2005 game, hold up to this day - and that is mostly due to the amazingly atmospheric shadow and lighting work. You can see enemy shadows cast on walls, lights flicker and shake around; causing tension and unease. You always feel on edge and pumped with adrenaline. Although I don't do well with the horror aspect, the addictive game play always has me coming back for more. Once I am finished with my first play through, and the fear factor is out of the way, I will definitely be playing it again just to feel the sweet, sweet satisfaction of slow-mo face kicking, shot gun blasting, body flying action."
76561198319113482,1569187371,True,"Thanks to some excellent lighting effects F.E.A.R. still holds up surprisingly well considering its release date of 2005. The graphics themselves are not impressive, but when combined with the lighting and shadows, the game ends up dripping with a creepy atmosphere. The explosions and particle effects look fantastic when using the slo-mo ability. I constantly find myself trying to go about every engagement with the enemy in ways that will cause the most devastation so I can hit that slo-mo button and appreciate all the beautiful chaos I create. The game also has some excellent enemy AI. It makes for much more interesting engagements than your standard FPS enemies. I recommend playing it on the higher difficulty settings to really see it in action.

After installing and running the game for the first time I noticed it wouldn’t run above 30ish FPS, and it is lacking basic QOL settings such as having a FOV slider or certain resolutions, but a quick visit to the F.E.A.R. pc gaming wiki had me up and running at high FPS and a much more comfortable 105 FOV. I also learned you have to disable FSAA in order to use 4K resolution or else you are going to be stuck on a black screen until you modify the settings.cfg file.

If you don’t mind doing a work around or two, F.E.A.R. is an excellent older game that anybody that enjoys either quality FPS games or a creepy atmosphere, definitely should give a play.

76561198004219629,1569172275,True,"Game aged pretty well for being about 14 years old. Slo-mo mechanics lets you mow down enemies like a badass and the AI is pretty aggressive. The story had me captive and a few jump scares to keep it refreshing. 

First game was great and wanted to continue for the storyline. But the expansions had technical issues that weren't patched like the original. You would often get the ""disconnected from sever"" error or ""out of memory"" when loading to a new interval if you don't change your graphic settings to minimal/low before starting it. AI improved but the hoops to get through the game are tedious.

+ A soundscape that strongly enhances the experience.
+ An A.I. that surpasses recent games. The work done here is truly magnificent and I wish to point that out as something extraordinary. The battles of F.E.A.R are the closest I've come to fighting against  actual human players.
+ Superb level design which doesn't get you lost but doesn't hold your hand either while managing vast labyrinth-like spaces.

[h1]And so we come to the bad...[/h1]
- The graphics haven't aged well. It was on the low end already in 2005 when it came out compared to other games of that year and it looks the more robust and simple today.
- It followed the footsteps of it's predecessors that had this logical flaw of collectables like heavy weapons and ammo lying around in places where they should not be, like in an office building. Or security gun turrets that descend from an office ceiling.
- The story and lore was executed through written material and recordings that forced you to sit tight while it was delivered. It was harmful towards the pace of the game, felt uninspiring to follow and actually I couldn't care less about it.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Technology expires, games do too and there's really nothing truly valuable F.E.A.R. can offer to the demanding player of today."
76561197974603469,1569076148,True,❤️❤️❤️I love this game❤️❤️❤️
76561198012095879,1568924483,True,"I was playing this game with NMod v2. What can I say - this is first time I tried F.E.A.R. due to some Reddit post saying that gunplay here is fantastic. And, yes it is. Shotgun especially does it's job and I assume that NMod even makes it even better. 

As for game. This is classical old school story based corridor shooter. There is no 'open areas' just fixed path to complete all levels - always in some kind of buildings / passages. Visuals are a little dated but ok, there is not too much of music but it fits well. Sound fx's are great. Enemy AI is surprisingly good (I was playing on hard) - they do flank, cover, run around etc. 

As for story - it's ok but nothing spectacular. It's quite traditional story, quite easy to predict, more or less.

There are no crazy jump-scares which I appreciate.

In summary - mechanics and gameplay is typical for old school shooter - f.e. Half Life. It was fun to play."
76561198027749875,1568843099,True,"Short Version: One of the most impressive graphical achievements in the past years. F.E.A.R. has the best combat and AI you'll find, and this is from 2005 of all years. It's adored for its combat alone, but as for the horror? Eh, it's there but not really all that memorable minus the final scenes. If you're a fan of Max Payne style shooters you'll love this game for the amount of detail there is in a single firefight. The maps are good, you'll know where you've been since the bodies of your foes stick around (hehe, Nail gun). The story is...meh...it's alright but nothing noteworthy. Play F.E.A.R. 1 for the combat, it's worth it.

Long Version: F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) is the first installment to the series by Monolith and Warner Brothers. The game places the player in an unnamed soldier/rookie to undergo a massive outbreak of clone soldiers controlled telepathically by one Paxton Fettel. The player must use his wits to defeat squads of soldiers and mechs that stand in his way, but there is also an entity that threatens the status of the mission, Alma Wade, who you will encounter throughout the campaign. This is as far as I can go with the story, it's not much to look at and it doesn't run of much beside one plot twist that doesn't really do much overall beside adding sequels. It's best to ignore the story if you want to.

  The combat of F.E.A.R. is the game's strongest point as you have AI that is extremely immersive in tactics and can use multiple ways to take you out by flanking, flushing you out of cover, or communicating with their squad.  You, the player, can slow down time to pick out targets or just go all Max Payne style if you want. There's no other way to describe the combat, you must experience it for yourself. It gives a life to the AI that hasn't been seen in a long time with recent games in the 2000s. There are your usual squads that are there to give tactical fights, invisible assassins that will more than likely scare you just by having almost no sound, and then there's the mechs which can break down walls and are essentially bullet sponges. There are other enemies but they're aren't as present as these 3 are.

  Now the graphics of F.E.A.R. are surprisingly impressive for its time period. One of the first areas you see has a few ceiling lights that you can shoot. These lights will actually react to you by flashing, and the combat will also show this. You will see sparks flying, explosions, and it's a blast to see it all come together. I believe there is a mod that changes the textures to the standards of the recent F.E.A.R. games but I can't recall if it's still in production. Regardless, the graphics are the most impressive thing in the game.

  For horror fans, there's not much to write about in my honest opinion. The scares are usually well built and they're not in your face as recent horror games have done. Sometimes the scares are more hilarious than they actually are. One in particular is with a camera, that's about all I'll say. You'll know it when you see it. 

  At the time of this review, F.E.A.R. 1 comes with its two expansion packs that are considered non-canon; Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. Extraction Point takes place after the main game and features more horror that either works or doesn't. It also includes new weapons and some new enemies that feel unnecessary as they only hold new weapons and their AI doesn't seem to work as well as before. Extraction Point did manage to make maps interesting, however, with turrets to hold out your flanks and holdout positions. Perseus Mandate places the player in a separate scenario that does nothing to the story but add confusion. The combat feels eh, and the horror is misplaced as you have a companion with you most of the time so there isn't much of a sense of danger. 

  Overall, I give F.E.A.R. 1 a B+
  Extraction Point, I give a B-
  Perseus Mandate, I give a D"

It doesn't surprise me why it got sequels this game was very entertaining

I get why people say the AI is good in this game, they try to flank, can parkour and generally are really fun to fight (I like the touch where one time the AI was behind a couch and when I started firing they flipped the couch to hide behind it)

I laughed a little when I found a paper that showed someones bottom that you would get from sitting on a photo copier machine

the game only had very minor glitches first when I tried opening the game and switched the resolution (it closed the game) next the enemies shot me through a wall once and I got stuck in the escalator thingy but jumping luckily dislodged me. lastly I equipped a different gun once and the other gun went beneath the floor

[u]Review for fear extraction[/u]
 finished fear extraction point which was also good I think it felt kinda stuttery compared to the original but it was still good

I will mention I'm pretty wimpy when it comes to horror so I ended up playing during the day and I was fine

[u]Review for Persious Mandate[/u]
not nearly as good as the origional or fear extraction because there is so many bugs in this one such as one time I got stuck in a fence and had to reload a save. I crashed 4 times and there were major lighting/rendering issues where at times you couldn't  see because of the rendering so it still was ok but it really wasn't great"

If you like fps games FEAR is a must, don't let be fooled by its name, this isn't an horror game, it's an horror themed fps.

76561198436575473,1568547563,True,"This game has aged superbly.

This is my first time playing the game. Yes, I know I'm a bit late to the party but hey, I caught up. In fact, I've actually been wanting to play this game for a long time and thankfully the franchise was on sale on HB. I'm very glad I decided to purchase the bundle, or at least this game - I haven't played the others yet.

This game has absolutely withstood the test of time. I was hooked on it thanks to the game play from the moment I started. Whether that's due to the game being superb or me being nostalgic, I can't say. No, that's a lie it's both. This game unlike so many others from it's day and age runs flawlessly on modern hardware. I have an i7, 1060ti and 16gb of RAM. I didn't experience a single glitch or hiccup and maintained a consistent frame rate. Aside from how well it runs, I found myself overwhelmed by the amount of joy it delivered. This is one of those older school shooters that was made well. The story is unique and provides enough twists to be entertaining. The gun play was excellent as well. There is a suitable variety of guns some of which are fun to use - like the needle rifle that pins enemies to walls. The AI was surprising as well. They flank, they tank cover and lean out of cover and throw grenades if you hunker down. Oh and the horror elements are wonderfully implemented as well. You probably won't be scared if you are use to horror like I am but you will be pleasantly surprised.

All in all, this was an amazingly fun game that kept me immersed through the entire story line. If you can find the game by itself, I recommend buying it. I just hope I enjoy 2 and 3 as much as I enjoyed this one!"

Maybe the rights holders make more money on the later titles than the earlier ones; I seriously have no idea why this is happening.

[If you are in the future reading this, let me elaborate: As I am writing this, it is the latter part of the year 2019, and the price for this game is 54 dollars, because you can only buy it a pack which has every F.E.A.R title.  Like I said, I have no idea when this happened or why, but it is total B.S.]

F.E.A.R (the first one) is one of the greatest FPS games to ever be released, and it's worth picking up ENTIRELY ON ITS OWN.  There are two expansions, but the one that you want is Extraction Point.  Other people have talked about why it's great, so I won't repeat what has been said.  Mandalore Gaming put a good video on it on YouTube, and Civvie11 will probably get around to making one as well (check if you are a time traveler from the future).

If you are curious about older shooters and want to see what the hype was about (or are going through Monolith's catalogue, which is *absolutely* worth it) get it for the five or ten (which is still damn expensive, DOOM 2016 is like 20 dollars these days) dollars it is worth.

DO NOT BUY THIS WHOLE PACK.

It was the best ever Half-Life-style multiplayer FPS--even better than any of the Half-Life multiplayer games.

In the single player mode, though, I loved how the AI coordinated their attacks--""flush him out,""--throwing grenades, flanking your position, and sometimes just chickening out--""Move in,"" ""Negative,"" ""No way!""

But probably one of my favorite parts of the game was the HV Penetrator gun. I'm surprised that this gun doesn't ever get mentioned in FPS 'best of' lists. The physics of the gun, how it pins your enemies to the wall behind them, and the gun's sound and feel were just pure awesome. It reminded me a little bit of the nail grenade gun in the Schwarzenegger movie Eraser. That HV Penetrator and the black hole gun from Unreal 2 are the two most memorable weapons out of all the FPS games I've ever played."

76561198165365435,1567184349,True,"By far the best game in the series, FEAR is a perfect combination of psychological horror and FPS. Enemy AI is very advanced for a game from 2005. You will fight super soldiers who give commands to each other, try to flank you, use grenades to lure you out. You will be outnumbered and outgunned all the time, assassins sneaking behind you, robots with grenade launchers in front of you, helicopters above you... 

But they are not the ones you should be afraid of. When the shooting stops and you see the lights flickering you will know she is close. She will get both your and your character's hearts racing. Once you meet her you will wish for super soldiers to come back and kill you one more time.

"
76561197985596506,1567035598,True,"I still find myself impressed by the AI and the atmosphere. Granted, a lot of the reviews from the past mentioning that the environment wasn't very exciting are not entirely wrong. There is only so much you can do with offices and municipal works areas, but there is quite a bit that has been done and done well. You always have this feeling of being entirely alone against a bizarre network of events that have you going in deeper and deeper into an unclear situation. A cannibalistic psychic commander, company security complicit in the murder of employees, key people being brutally killed or simply disappearing... This is on top of the hallucinations and voices the point man experiences, which others don't always seem to notice. You are always being watched, but you don't know by who or what and why. 

The music makes the game. It's there and it is there in force. It usually doesn't really tell you how to feel, but contributes to it. There are orchestral stings and jump scares, but the pacing of the game makes sure that the spooky parts are divided well between the gun battles and times when nothing really happens and you are just trying to find your way to a certain area. That's what really contributes to the game. It puts you into a situation where you are just trying to do your job, but things just keep getting murkier, and all you can do is follow orders because it's your duty. 

There is also good variety with the enemies. True, a lot of them are mindless clones, but their skill, look and weaponry are different enough to know what kind of threat you are getting into. Between them are the nightmares, as well as ATC security and even mechs. 

Also the physics are amazing, but runs oddly on modern hardware. I have had enemy soldiers fly dozens of feet into the air when I killed them."

The gunplay feels good and the tone remains tense. The pacing is good and the atmosphere will probably scare a little pee out of you. The story is solid, but nothing mind blowing. 

This is a solid game. However, it seems like you can't buy this game alone anymore and have to buy it in a pack with a steep price tag. I don't think this is worth the current asking price. If you can get this on a good sale then it could be worth picking up."

Slightly confused, I assumed a corpse was bugging out but no no no, it was a clone soldier flippin' CRAWLING underneath my line of fire to flank me. I did not know they commando crawl around on the floor! What. the. flip! Biggest smile on my face after i realized what I just saw.

Still the best AI in video games all these years later~"

76561198024731481,1566170845,True,"Fear is an incredible FPS. It's not quite as good as Half-Life 2, but feels like a combination of it and Doom 3. The horror aspects are great, although not all that scary. Where the game shines, however, is the combat. You can only carry 3 weapons at a time, but other than the pistol there isn't a bad weapon in the game. The shotgun in particular is incredible and stands out as one of the best in any game.

Even if you're not a fan of horror, Fear is worth a playthrough. Play it on the hardest difficulty, quicksave often, and keep the shotgun throughout the whole game. You'll love it."
76561198124827639,1566165366,False,"The first time I finished the game I thought it was ok but the more time passed the more I become aware of its flaws and decided that the game is just plain bad. Plot and story telling is hard to track, gunplay is boring and its basically just a really hollow game. The only thing that is worth praising is its AI and AI alone isnt enough to call it a good game."

76561198112717909,1565669211,True,"It's an honest shame that time is forgetting about the original F.E.A.R (even embarrassingly still that people thing Trepang2 is the somehow the next F.E.A.R, but that's for another day), but still, I want to make time to remember this nearly 2 decade old game and the many achievements it helped pioneered, most of which, is the AI.

 F.E.A.R's AI is one of the harshest's and most persistent AI i've ever had to deal with, mostly because the way it was programmed. While I'm not a coder (or particularly good with math), I can tell you that the AI was made that it had goals in mind, all centered on how to kill the player and use the surrounding area to it's advantage. The result is a challenge for the player to outwit the AI, and it proves a satisfying challenge indeed. One other thing to note is how fluid the animations are, for both you and the enemy. It's impressively lifelife, even a decade and a half later.

Also of note is how well the game balances the horror to action aspect. It's one of few games that i've played, along with the original Dead Space and Doom 3 that creates a perfect symmetry between hunter and hunted. Certainly they might be pulls from J-horror, but I think it works pretty well in F.E.A.R, all things considered. One moment you're kicking ass in the middle of an office complex, the next you could be in someone's nightmare.

The final thing I would like to note of is quite the underappreciated aspect of F.E.A.R, and that's its' story. While I don't want to give away much or tell too much, the main central idea of the original story is that the lust and glutton of power and the want for more will eventually kill all those who were undeserving it. There's a ton to explore, but that's for you to find out.

I could go on and on about the other great things about F.E.A.R, such as its' spectacular bullet time mechanic, the gore and other visual effects, and the satisfaction of using the weapons, but I hope some of the highlights that i've given you are enough to warrant a purchase (maybe not on Steam, but on either Humble or GOG).

Go fuck shit up, or get fucked up.

Level design for a linear shooter is also good and rewards just the right amount of tactical strategy. All three games have something to recommend them to be honest, but I find the second focuses too much on the horror and the third one jumps the shark altogether.

Wow, has it really been 15 years since this classic hit our gaming libraries? I must confess, some games do not age well, but [i]F.E.A.R.[/i] is not one of them. After all this time, it still is one of the best horror fps titles around, by even establishing some ground rules for the genre and introducing the best A.I. ever in horror fps. Let's take a close look at Monolith's timeless masterpiece, then.

Here, we are initiated into F.E.A.R. - or First Encounter Assault Recon - a special opps team brought together and funded by the U.S. government to investigate and engage paranormal threats. As the game begins, we are not introduced with much aside the fact that we are the newly recruited ""Point Man"" for the group and this will be our first mission for the organization. The game doesn't present you any background information or prior storyline, yet simply throws you into action and asks for you to discover details as you go. As our first mission, we are informed that a psychic commander in government contract, trained by ATC - Armacham Technology Corporation - has gone rogue: Paxton Fettel. He is now leading various replica super soldiers which he controls telepathically and attacking various ATC shareholdings. Our primary mission is to capture/eliminate Fettel - yet as the game progresses, we encounter new bits of information which colors the whole story in a different way... a way that would involve the tale of a little girl, a violent and creepy little girl called Alma.

Well, without presenting epic spoilers, this is as much as I can tell what [i]F.E.A.R.[/i] is about. I do prioritize narrative and storyline in all games that I play, and let me tell you: this one may not hold the most interesting, the most groundbreaking story elements of all times, yet the pacing and the construct of the narrative is a small masterpiece in the genre. This is a modern hero's journey - with a dark outlook on human ambition with one question at its core: are monsters born or made? Oh, and be ready for some plot twists!

The atmosphere is the best of its time in means of immersion and attention to detail. LithTech is an engine that can well be compared to either Quake or Unreal in its time - which presents you the best atmosphere and a rich level design for any fps game. The engine and the gameplay allow various tactical decisions, not only on your behalf, yet also for the A.I. Also, the level designs are plain wonderful: the game always rewards you for your intuition to check dark corners, yet you never get lost for long: making any walkthrough redundant. With some intuition, you'd complete the single player campaign in no time.

Going straight for the gameplay, WASD isn't something new. It's your basic fps combat, and some environment interaction, with ammo and health accumulation. The enemy interaction among each other, and their defensive/offensive tactics against you, are marvelous though. Enemies analyze, track and react to your movements in a nearly human way. If you try to take a detour around their premises and someone notices, you can hear them saying ""he is trying to flank!"" or if you'd manage to hit them hard in short time they ask for backup and the backup actually comes! They can try to dodge your attacks, or simply utilize the environment to establish makeshift barricades. Keep in mind that this was impressive in 2000s, and the enemy A.I. is still one of the best after all these years, making each combat encounter a thrill. The Slow-Mo mechanic is something unique to our protagonist, giving you an upper hand in all combat encounters, nonetheless. For a short period, you are allowed to move with superhuman speed - which makes everything around you seems like slow motion.

I just finished the single player campaign, and the multiplayer mode is disabled for the Steam version for some reason. I am yet to play the newer installations in the series, yet most people who played them declare them to be inferior to this one. Sadly, this game cannot be bought separately from the whole franchise here on Steam - and the series do go for 55 dollars. Now, that price is an exaggeration for games this old, however great they were to be, since they do not even have a multiplayer community anymore. If you are interested in single player mode, and the whole storyline, I strongly suggest for you to wait for a sale. Aside that money-milking approach of WB Interactive - since Vivendi is long merged with Activison Blizzard and WB adopted old Monolith games - the game is a classic of the genre. If you like the genre, this one is a must!

Now I must say there is a glitch where the game would stop running completely on the PC version if you are using Windows 10.

It's cool to see enemies flanking you and actually trying to kill you instead of the typical stand and duck, or bum-rush forms of AI (thought it can bug out at times and do stupid stuff that makes you laugh). It's really effective at making you feel badass too when you watch the bullet trails wizzing past you as you walk through shattered glass walls in slow motion.

76561198025674597,1563461896,True,"F.E.A.R., or First Encounter Assault Recon for friends, is a 2005 game that puts you in the boots of the recently appointed Point Man of a special task force. Your mission is to stop Paxton Fettel, a telepath who's controlling a clone army. Yes, it sounds weird, but it gets weirder, as there's also a creepy girl who shows up to you in visions, and who might be related to Fettel. An excellent mix of action and horror, it managed to scare me a couple of times.

The gameplay is solid. Unlike most FPS games, combat in this game is much more tactical, in no small part thanks to the amazing AI of the enemy soldiers. They'll flank you, they'll take cover, they'll try to flush you out using grenades, it really feels like you're fighting an actual military force (I think, since I haven't actually fought one in real life). Of course, you can use their strategies as well, changing cover, throwing grenades, and just being selective in which target has the highest priority. The game also offers you a nice variety of guns, though you can only carry three at a time; some of them are really good. And if that fails, there's also melee, which is actually an insta-kill (though getting in range for a melee attack can be dangerous as well). As Point Man, you also count with ""Reflex Mode"", which slows down time, giving you a small advantage over your enemies; I didn't use it as much as I'd have liked to, but it's a nice ability.

The level design is great. Now, for a game from 2005 it's not that impressive in the art department; though it's still good. However, the layout of the levels is great, with many alternate paths along the way, giving them a maze-like feel, but still feeling consistent. You're not just running through a corridor shooting bad guys; you're exploring a building that's been taken over by a hostile force.

I already talked a bit about the story, which is excellent. Again, a nice mix of action and horror, with a nice twist by the end. The character of Alma (the creepy girl) scared me a few times, and even Paxton himself had his moments. The soundtrack is also very good, and it tends to reflect the current situation well.

Well, that's all for my F.E.A.R. review. I can't believe it took me this long to play it, but I enjoyed it. Excellent game, and I recommend it.

EDIT:

Since I can't review the expansions separately, I'll make a short addendum to this review, since I don't wanna extend it a lot more. The game has two expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. The first expansion deals with the aftermath of the first game; you still play as Point Man, the main game's main character; I think if I wrote anything else I'd get into heavy spoiler territory. As for the second expansion, you play as another member of the F.E.A.R. team, with the story starting around the halfway point of the main game.

Overall, they're pretty good expansions, each one adding new weapons, as well as some new enemies, and shedding some more light on the overall story. However, I believe the expansions have been decanonized, as they're part of an ""alternate timeline"" or some sort. They're still pretty good either way."

76561198000227745,1562509743,True,"One of the best horror FPS in the genre, and it was a probably a top one when I first played it back in 2000's. From the newest games, only Outlast could scare me as much as this game did. Those invisible and fast soldiers in the office, where I would just get in the corner and try to stare so hard in the darkness to spot him. The soundwork is especially great: very fitting ambience and combat music - I usually turn all music off in games, but not in Fear series. After this game also play Extraction point - which is more scary than this game. And maybe avoid Perseus Mandate - it was really poor in my opinion."
76561198049343276,1562467437,True,"After more than a decade, this game still is a fantastic game worth playing! Better AI than 95% of titles today, great story line, good mix of horror and FPS. I sincerely recommend playing F.E.A.R. if you haven't already!

It even runs flawlessly with SteamPlay/Proton on Linux! :)"
76561197986997317,1562463903,True,You like blood? You like spooks? You like creepy little girls? You like the shoot shoots? You like bullet slows? This is the game for you.
76561198088745405,1562445052,True,Replaying this game brought back so many great memories. Highly recommend for anyone that likes fun action mixed in with horror.
76561198139505011,1562437550,True,"Fun game, will take you around 6 hours to finish. Its shooting is fun and the enemies are pretty smart.


Just finished both dlc for this game. They were not bad, in all around another 6 hours of fun shooting. I do have to note though, there are some problems, like the game disconnecting you and even some pretty bad lag in some areas in the dlc. One of the areas in the dlc wouldn't load unless I set all the game performance and graphical options to minimum. I could set it back to maximum after the loading though."

[seriously this game is great though.]"
76561197989790168,1562306078,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of those games that should be in everyone's game library's.  It's a fantastic FPS with an interesting story, the gameplay is fun, the AI is excellent, and since the Steam version includes the full game as well as the two expansions that were released for it, there are several hours of fun to be had with this package."
76561198084685139,1562305967,True,Best game to play when your extinguisher bursts into flames and you're waiting for a response to your email about a fire in your office.
76561198017891248,1562300113,False,Poorly optimised and practically unplayable on Win10 (unless you are okay with wildly fluctuating framerates and severe stuttering

76561198044080675,1562219619,True,"F.E.A.R is my childhood. I remember my older brothers playing this game, and wow, it still holds up even today. 

This is an amazing FPS. AI is brilliant and immersive. A game from 2014 supports native 3440x1440p without any patches (unlike Bethesda's Fallout 4) This is a true FPS game, still scary even though I've played it a few times. 

11/10 will make my nephews play it."
76561198196285242,1562216689,True,"This game is amazing, despite its graphics, it reminds me of Half-life, but the story is also as rich as that of Half-life. Would recommend to those who love action games and immersive games, especially if you played Half-life or Cry of Fear before."

76561198088385097,1562200343,True,A PC gaming gem that still holds up to this day. This game is a must for anyone who wants a classic shooter with a tense and unnerving atmosphere.
76561197967490296,1562199934,True,"If you're having issues with stuttering and choppiness, try setting the F.E.A.R.exe file to Compatibility Mode for Windows XP (SP2).

76561198013505957,1562183099,True,"good game but it gets a bit repetitive in the middle

extraction point is also good until the subway where the game commits suicide and barely functions with constant crashing and fps drops, it's a real turd"
76561198096292457,1562182270,True,maybe my favorite single-player fps of all time
76561198036805800,1562181806,True,"This game is a classic first person shooter, and definitely helped define the atmosphere of horror in modern video games. Definitely give this game a go if you've never played it before"
76561198138148068,1562162523,True,Had fun with game mechanics and Alma scared the shit out of me few times :D 11/10 game
76561198045300304,1562158765,True,"One of the best games out there, period. Amazing Gameplay, insane replay value and top notch level design and AI. Do yourself a favour and play this."

Surprised how dynamic and fresh the game mechanics feels - definitely didn't expect it to be this good.
+Great mechanics
+Dynamic gameplay
+Good AI
-Level Design and size
-You have to download a little file in order to optimize the framerate on Windows 10.
Definitely worth extra effort because the game runs extremely smooth."

76561198096428710,1562099123,True,"Good gameplay with smart A.I., but has framerate issues on Windows 10 for no apparent reason, but usually a computer restart can fix it."

76561198045389894,1562096550,True,"The best FPS ever made, gameplay wise speaking. Pure fun. Solid AI, great shadows and lights. Simply awesome!"

76561198081704574,1562055274,True,Stand Up to its name even if its old the graphics and story line is far much better from any other game and the jump scare parts are really scary <3 it do play at night with headphones you will get to know why its called FEAR
76561198152188108,1562045940,True,"A true classic, with exciting gameplay and great AI."
76561198210181544,1562041299,True,It's a pretty damn good game from start to finish. It's kinda scummy that you have to buy the whole F.E.A.R series if you want this game.
76561198315874376,1562032874,True,Wish I did not have to buy the other games just for this.
76561197976878142,1562026006,True,"Pretty good game, dated and a bit unorthadox to get running but it was a fun and enjoyable experince non the less."
76561198411920617,1562024647,True,fun game to get a quick F.E.A.R. aspect and has a decently good story and is worth a few run throughs of the game
76561198025450910,1562023367,True,"Definitive Shooter of 2005. Holds up very well, combat is faced paced, and AI is arguably one of the smartest in terms of taking cover, and rushing the player as a unit. Not that scary, but the atmosphere is pretty good. 9/10"
76561198046967344,1562022345,True,One of the best first person shooters ever made.

76561198049095191,1562011015,True,"FEAR has a special place in my heart. My older brother played this and Max Payne when I was younger, and it gave me an obsession for games with slo-mo mechanics ever since. The story is meh, the enemies are meh, the levels are meh, but the GUNPLAY is so gosh darn good. The guns all have weight, enemies take hits like the guys in Saving Private Ryan, and the slo-mo mechanic is so satisfying I'm not sure it's even legal. A modern classic, worth a play and then some."
76561198059000306,1562008339,True,One of the best FPS ever made. Period.
76561197987294419,1562000703,True,Amazing once you get it working
76561198076086980,1561995140,True,"The game is pretty fine. I have really enjoyed the psychodelic aspect with visions that was creepy, and I fell for the story. The only drawback for me (and it's totally up to your taste) was adding futuristic elements to the game (like mecha in example), but this aspect was really seldom appearing. As for the A.I. I was not sure why it was so praised, until I launched the game - the A.I. here is pretty freaking good. Nothing like I saw in other games. Also, the graphic quality of the game is still not that bad. So if you are up for some nonconventional FPS game with a pinch of horror don't wait - buy the game!"
76561198040445907,1561993092,True,"Solid shooter for 2005, need an extra file to be able to play without FPS lag though."
76561198044945417,1561989273,True,"F.E.A.R is a excellent first person shooter and average horror game. 
+ Action is very much the best aspect of the game and its really fun to fight with AI that's both challenging and intelligent.
+ Reflex mode makes the action feel and look great.
+/- Horror isn't bad but feel's underwhelming compared to extraction point, but still the atmosphere is alright for the most of the game.
- Although the combat arenas are done in a way combat is great but the settings are just office buildings and construction sites for the most of the run and it really makes the game feel dull in a way. 
+/- Story is okay and it holds up on its own merit.
I recommend F.E.A.R for all to play who would like to play good shooter with a dose of horror.

"
76561198122279082,1561987655,True,Fun gud gam
76561197995839798,1561985634,True,14 years ago this game came out. The A.I. is still as fantastic as ever too. Shame F.E.A.R 2 and 3 don't share this level of awesome.

76561197985556686,1561985380,True,Doesn't hold up very well over time (graphically) but still a good start for the FPS / Horror blend genre circa HL2 era
76561197982831308,1561982634,True,Great Great
76561198047087126,1561979021,True,still a damn fine game
76561198025909079,1561977585,True,"Out of all three FEAR games this one is easily the best. Sadly you have to buy the full bundle to get this game, but on a sale it's definitely worth it. Even with out common game mechanics like regening health, ADS, or sprinting this game still feels very modern and holds up to today as a very solid shooter. It's awesome playing this game and feeling the influence this game had in the gaming world. If you're curious about the game and why it matters I would highly recommend watching GVMERS' (youtube channel)  video on this game. They do a great job of explaining what this game and how it was something completely new, and how no one has managed to create another game that's similar to this and holds a candle to it."
76561198087516894,1561960702,True,"I'm a little late, whatever. I found out about this game when I was seven. My dad came home from Iraq and had it on disk. Sadly the disk was damaged and he had lost the cd key. After a few years I found the PS3 Edition and my god did I become a zombie at school. I played it non-stop, it was so fun to me for some reason. It has fun gunfight and bone chilling moments, all I needed as a teen. I even had my little brother play it. It was fun to watch him scream or just walk out of the room. If you are looking to buy go for it. It is worth so much more then the price tag."
76561198085519727,1561952710,True,"Fun, Fast, Brutal and Immersive.

All qualities that most shooters around the era of this game seem to have forgotten."

76561198043465286,1561931526,True,"My favorite FPS on steam, horror elements aside. This game is visual romp through bad guys, mechs, and invisible assassins. And it carries pace the entire way, if you haven't played this yet it really is a must buy, but  I do suggest grabbing it on GoG instead of steam.
Also, side note. MP is dead, maybe there are some workarounds, but I really only care about the single player aspect on this one."
76561197987057841,1561930804,True,"There have been entire papers written about this game's AI and how it works hand in hand with the level design, and audio cues to create the illusion of truly intelligent adversaries that keep you on your toes, and out of the bad habit of walking down corridors fighting enemies single file. If every developer spent a session playing F.E.A.R. before creating their enemies and levels all games would be superior for the inspiration. There are some things this game accomplishes that almost no game ever will again."
76561198022082256,1561930166,True,Nostalgic as fuck if you played it on console when it first came out.
76561198240239536,1561919729,True,great fps

76561198041935128,1561916926,True,"This is a good ol' classic fps in which the reactionary ai can create both an amazing experience for the game and a sensation of excitement as you turn enemies into red mist. Love beating it as much as I have, the first fps game i ever beat on hard and feels good to blink flash kill whole rooms of people :)"
76561198004740373,1561907386,True,"One of my all time favorite games, I haven't played an FPS with AI like it since."
76561198068892800,1561905747,True,the gunplay in fear is still considered to be unmatched by any other game released since and with good reason
76561198027168760,1561895587,True,"I came in for a shooter, known for its great gunplay and its slow motion. What I got was a terrifingly tense experience, and it wasn't just because of the little girl. The tense encounters with enemies, the open and splitting map design of the levels allows for encounters happening in a number of ways, leading to easy replayibility. I cannot do nothing but recommend this to anyone."

76561198010296387,1561869367,True,"This game is still fun and challenging even after playing through it a few times.

76561198203111475,1561867976,True,Great combat AI and gameplay.
76561198255457153,1561865968,True,"This game is easily known to be the best of the series. And I recommend anyone who likes a fun shooter with great rag dolls physics and a good feel to get this game. As the gameplay is enough for replayability, although I don't approve of the way that the bundled it with the rest as an excuse to make it more expensive. That is some greedy marketing."
76561197982909541,1561858613,True,I enjoyed this game but it needs to be scarier.  more of the jump & scream moments please.
76561198027978031,1561856080,True,Im really liking this game. A couple of jump scares for me!
76561198827796311,1561855256,True,"I got this game in a bundle with the two sequels because I remembered enjoying FEAR 3 a while ago and man was I missing out, this game is top tier even after all these years. It's really helped out by the great lighting and amazing gunplay. In my opinion this is by far the best in the series and it was definitely worth the $5 I paid for all three."
76561198260445397,1561851139,True,good story and long
76561198286535641,1561849747,True,"FEAR is an excellent title that brings back the nostalgia of when we were young and first exploring the gaming world. Story, game mechanics, horror, and FPS shooting are all incredible and offers great replay ability. Definitely a good purchase if you are looking for a good solo-game in a marketplace where almost everything is multiplayer."

The story heavily focused on Alma and what has happened to her before and after would blow your mind. The combat system was pretty simple. The subtitles (I'm deaf) was pretty hard to read until you play F.E.A.R 2 and 3, it's readable. The previous versions and DLCS need to be fixed. I don't know why they make it so small on big resolutions, haha. The graphics in previous versions are subpar but 2 & 3 was amazing! If you like storymode games, this is the ones to check out. The prices are worth it too :)"

76561197985828170,1561843517,True,This used to give me the creep when I was young. Too bad it has so many issues with latest machines it'll be impossible to play. Just like when I used to gave a Pentium 4 ... *sigh*

10/10"
76561198057232770,1561838036,True,"FEAR is easily among the best shooters out there, and in my opinion, probably my personal favorite first-person shooter of all time. There's not much which hasn't been said about FEAR in terms of positives, so I'll start with the negatives. Extraction Point doesn't have native widescreen. The other enemy types, and to an extent the APC, aren't as fun to fight as the Replica, and their variety wasn't needed for reasons I'll get into later on. The horror aspect sucks, for the most part, and beyond that, the game is not truly horror. It isn't used in anything beyond a theme, which it uses poorly, despite a strong atmosphere. The story isn't that great. The main negative is that, the difficulty isn't extremely high, and the game is really made to be played on the hardest difficulty, where as the lower difficulties - Anything lower than Extreme - Is not going to do the game justice in the majority of its aspects. Not that they are going to be outright bad, but, that they'll be downgraded, at least some of the most important ones for the gameplay, such as the artificial intelligence. Mech enemies are not very interesting to fight, despite their cool mechanical design taking direct cues from RoboCop. And I suppose not being able to carry more than 3 weapons can be a bit of a bummer - And the lack of the console exclusive weapons is a huge bummer, though not the fault of the game per-say, but more of Warner Bros. That's all the negatives. Now for the big, big positives.

The game's level design is incredible, but not complex - It is fairly simplistic and works extremely well for its artificial intelligence and particle effects. The level progression is great too and you can always know when you've gone somewhere from the extreme destruction of large, exaggerated but stylish bullet holes on concrete walls, the dust and glass everywhere and blood. The slow-mo helps you fight off against extremely smart enemies, which is one of the game's highest positives - As the enemies are very smart and even so when they are alone, although, the artificial intelligence on the APC aren't as good. How enemies communicate gives them not only personality but they let you know of details of their procedures which can help you during gameplay. 

 The gunplay is incredible too, with impactful gun sounds, terrific particle effects, over-the-top ragdolls and gore, and one fantastic atmosphere which either lets your ears be filled with the sounds of gunfire, enemy chatter and death sounds, or the atmospheric and stylish soundtrack, with its tribal and industrial soundscapes that fit its atmosphere perfectly. Despite only throwing squads at you, the level design keeps you on track during rampages onto these smart troops of cybernetic clones - But also off-track enough to make them have a higher fighting chance and to not get you to kill all of them at the same time, even if you can do that if you're good enough. Every firefight can be replayed, obviously - And they all turn out differently, even if you pick the same gun and strategies. I'd also like to mention how throwables are useful, and melee is incredibly fun.

 Enemies have some surprises for you too, which I won't get into. I might add, the shotgun in this game is easily the best shotgun in all of gaming, although RAGE 2's shotgun gets pretty close to being just as good. The shotgun can shred through enemies, and when they wield it, they will shred through you. Gibbing enemies with them, is incredible, and doing so with the rail gun is just as fun, by peeling off the flesh from enemies and only leaving their skeleton, which is electrocuted for good measure. All of the game's weapons are very fun to use nonetheless, despite most of them not being particularly creative compared to other shooters.

The game is immersive, with its often silent atmosphere, the cold wind and breeze of the outside and enemy chatter as they hunt you down. The Replica have a high amount of personality, with their chatter going from at times banter to other times desperation and anger, but all in pure strategy. The game looks good to this day, too, with crisp and sharp visuals, impressive particle effects and parallax bullet holes and decals, and very well made dynamic lighting, which really adds to the game's tone. However, without many of these carefully planned and made environments and levels, the game would not look as good - As can be seen with a good portion of the expansion Perseus Mandate. 

As for the expansions, Perseus Mandate is the shittiest. It has the worst level design, although it still holds fun segments, and for that, it worsens the artificial intelligence. Many of the new enemies have no personality and the difficulty becomes artificial in some smaller segments, which isn't what the main game is at all. The story is also far worse. Although, it has improved horror, with some areas which hold a great atmosphere and soundscape, and the music made for it is still high quality. Some of the level portions seen in this expansion are also still well made. The new weapons are fun to use and work well with the game. Extraction Point has no more negatives, but has one additional positive - It has more level variety, while still maintaining an excellent quality. The horror is downgraded although some segments suffer from being more boring than the original game, although, much like Perseus Mandate, has segments in which the horror, and the atmosphere + soundscape of those segments, is highly improved. The new guns for this mode, and the new enemies, although fewer and less relevant than Perseus Mandate's additions, are still of high quality, with its enemies being of higher quality than of Perseus Mandate. The best addition of Extraction Point is being able to destroy boxes and kick open doors, or just punch them open. I would say that its story and psychological horror are improved over the main-game, making it personally better than the already excellent main game.

There are few games like FEAR anymore, or at least, that recapture its essence. The stylish and over-the-top particle effects combined with the huge and exaggerated bullet holes with parallax depth, with a more silent and simplistic atmosphere to heighten its effects, from the lighting, particle chaos, gore and ragdolls, and the contrast of cold silence with enemy chatter, gun shots and railguns. Nothing reaches its style with the slow-motion, the gore, the ragdolls and the artificial intelligence. It all works together to form a game that wears many of its inspirations on its sleeve - From The Matrix, to Akira, to Cowboy Bebop and anything John Woo or Max Payne - FEAR offers an incredibly compelling, immersive and constantly replayable from being fun alone that almost no other game could ever recapture with the same flow, pacing or style.

10/10 - It may not have the story and horror of FEAR 2, Or its mechs... Or the coop, psychic abilities, and more mechs, that FEAR 3 has, but it rises above all of them for its prowess in AI, level design and pure style and flow."

76561198020973617,1561791935,True,"One of the best shooters out there. Also don't play the expansion packs, they basically are really unbalanced and introduce frustrating enemies and enemy encounters that would make you want to punch a wall. Also the expansions weren't made by the same team that did F.E.A.R. and are also not cannon so if you don't play them you  wont miss out on anything. Also a bit about the sequel and the last game. I'm gonna have to say that the sequel is actually fairly decent if not a step down from the predecessor but its still pretty decent the only thing I don't recommend is the DLC to it since it is fairly short and it does have some frustrating parts to it but after that it's over and it just makes you not want to play F.E.A.R. at all because of the dip in quality. Then you get F.E.A.R. 3 which is a co-op shooter and it tries to mimic call of duty and overall plays like a heaping pile of crap. You know there is a problem when all of your games start to slowly lose their identity to the point where they are a former shell of themselves and that's exactly what F.E.A.R. does as the series progresses it loses itself just so it can be like the juggernaut itself Call of Duty and that is why the F.E.A.R. franchise is now dead.

Also I played these games on the hardest mode and that was a breeze so if you want to think that I just suck at shooters and that my opinion is subjective then that's fine and I encourage you to seek out all the DLC's and the third installment of the game and experience it for yourself just like I did.

Other than that highly recommend the first game and the sequel, not as much but enough to warrant a play through or at least trying it out to see if it's your cup of tea."

I'm impressed with the AI, far better than almost any fps game out there but I can't say the same with the weapons, some have unreal amount of recoil and weird controls, sounds are good though making you feel like you are actually in combat.Level design is boring, almost every single room and place looks very similar to ones before and the difficulty is kinda good you hope it will be harder at the end but nope, it gets easier not because you have everything but you encounter less and less powerful enemies in the end which is a bad design choice for me.Story is interesting and good except some details like from start to end you always beat around the bush and nothing goes the way it supposed to be, every single point has some sort of blockage and I think that's a way to increase the length of the known story blindly just because they ran out of ideas.

At the end; F.E.A.R. is alright, worth to be played if you are looking for some methodical very slow-paced fps game which can make you sweat at times and catch you off guard with its unnerving jumpscares."

The ambient so dark and spookie make u fell under an panica attack so easly, the supernatural events just ... uis like an interactive movie but yeah not like a graphic exploration, its an FPS!
Gosh the bullet timeand the interaction with the map and also with the enemy (ah yeah, this game also now 14 years later has the best AI that i ever seen so far) is all so good...

Also some issues will occur if you use a logitech mouse/keyboard but you can find the fix pretty easily in the community hub.  *****

The game itself is first person shooter horror at its absolute finest. A.I. is very impressive, it seems that the enemies are afraid of death and use cover, try to flank, use objects in the levels to their advantage and are generally more intelligent than today's A.I. The atmosphere it creates is unmatched, the graphics are still awesome considering it was released back in 2005, and the combat is crazy fun.  Slo-mo is really the icing on the cake.

Because of time and budget constraints, FEAR won't offer a whole lot of variety. Thankfully, Gameplay wise it still holds up above most modern FPS.
The secret is a combination of non traditional AI (GOAP) and carefully made level design.For one game of countless opportunities.
Check subsequent entries, for how bad level design can deconstruct the once complex AI.
FEAR puts insane work on selling the illusion of fighting real people. Enemies, that are fully aware of their environments, that can search and locate the player by themselves, they know how to properly flank, roll, interact with objects for cover. They show individual and squad based decisions. Monolith didn't stop there. The map is constructed in a certain. Its a series of interconnected rooms and corridors, with carefully placed items.
Unlike the expansions, FEAR does not overly rely on its slowmo ability. Which helps showcase the AI in a more fast paced tactical shooter.
The dynamic lighting, plays a part on giving enemy position and be interacted during intense gunfights when bullets it light sources.
The color scheme is intentional in making enemies stand out from the environment.
The squad lines helps selling the magical AI, giving the illusion of intelligence, as well as serving a gameplay purpose of sending information to the player.
Basically by not cluttering the experience, with unnecessary confirmation sounds, UI, highlighted objects or markers.

It is unfortunate that the environment is mostly the same.
The arsenal is quite good and well balanced, there's just not that many weapons and ofcourse the gimmick of placing weapons near where they would be most effective, instead of letting the player carry more than 3, is heh...its not that bad.
The story is over convoluted, but at least FEAR doesn't force it. F3AR is the one with the ridiculous ""compelling"" narrative.
BTW, the SMG sucks!!!

XP, TimeGate shows difficulty replicating the level design from the original, instead opting to aim towards fixing the most criticised aspects of the original.
There's more content, more level variety and much more verticality to the maps.
Overall, the game feels more scripted, in a spectacularly predictable piece with a larger scale of destruction.
Its a successful change in direction, and even the classic level design will appear sporadically. Proving this team understood what made the original good.
XP often prefers to ambush the player on large open areas, filled with tougher enemy variations. New additional weapons for the job, like throwable sentries that stick to walls and provide protection over non covered angles.
They often forget the little details. with less shadows and many areas being well lit.

[h1] [b] You made it...whoever you might be - Perseus Mandate	[/b][/h1]
Introduces a new character, then goes through extreme lengths to justify keeping the gameplay, Aswell has offering the same interactions with both Alma and Paxton. 
PM also excels in bad maps, it achieves its difficulty quota, with the new Nightcrawlers, These work well within the level constraints, but the remaining enemies feel like jobbers, due to an overabundance of long corridors and chokes.
Slowmo trivializes many of the fights, however the latent risks of advancing without proper cover insist of relying on it more often.
The new Nightcrawler enemies are the one saving grace of PM, but they also have slowmo ability, and that makes them insanely hard to fight without also using it yourself.
The new paranormal enemy, is barely even a jump scare. It's an enemy that hides under a black puddle and grabs the player if he unknowingly steps over it. The maps are often to well lit for it to work, they also tend to drop multiple of these in the same area, ruining what could have been if properly added.
the grenade launcher is a cool new weapon, but Nightcrawlers equipped with it, can be frustrating, for how large the explosion radius is.
Its a mediocre expansion that just so happens to work on the FEAR engine, and that was perfectly ok.

76561198348428086,1559870598,True,"F.E.A.R. is a masterpiece of a game. It's a must-play for any gamer.

First off, what's good?
1) The atmosphere. The game does a great job with the horror. The game has a lot of genuine scares. As a horror game, it succeeds.
2) The enemy AI. The enemy AI is incredible, and very advanced for 2005 standards. Enemies take cover, utilize suppressing fire, flank the player, and do other cool stuff. Also, enemies give orders to each other, and act as a cohesive unit. I have beaten this game no less than four times, yet I am amazed by the AI every time. The enemy AI is what makes F.E.A.R.'s combat so great
3) The combat. The combat is fun as heck. The game permits you, the player, can slow-down time so that you can better engage the enemy. And trust me, you need to use the slo-mo mechanic, or else you don't have a chance in combat. The enemy AI, coupled with the slo-mo mechanic, makes combat challenging and enjoyable.
4) The guns. All of the guns are fun to use. None of the guns feel weak or under-powered. All of the guns are effective, provided that you know how to use them. The dual-wielded pistols, the shotgun, and the submachine gun are great when your in close-range combat. When in far-range combat, the particle gun, the Penetrator, and the hand-cannon are all good choices. If you need to take down a Powered-Armor, the rocket launcher and the penetrator are great for that. And last, but not least, the assault rifle is good for virtually any situation. Long-range, short-range, there's nothing that the assault rifle can't handle. The awesome guns are yet another reason why the combat is so awesome.
5) The grenade throwing is fun.
6) The story is very good. In F.E.A.R., you play as the Pointman, an agent working for a secret government organization known as F.E.A.R. You are investigating an uproar going on in the headquarters of Armacham, a major corporation. It turns out that a ghost named Alma Wade convinced her son, Paxton Fettel, to kill everyone in Armacham because Armacham did horrific experiments on Alma when she was a girl (although most of Armacham's employees weren't aware of Alma and the abuse that she suffered). The story goes on from there, and I won't spoil it, but the story is great.
7) Balance. The game is well-balanced. The combat rarely, if ever, feels unfair. The fact that the combat is well-balanced further adds to the game's enjoyment.

F.E.A.R. is a great game, but it's not perfect. So, what's bad?
1) The story is actually good, but it's poorly told, if that makes sense. The game tries to tell the story via voicemails and laptop messages that you find on the way. However, the messages are extremely vague, and don't do a good job telling you about what's going on. I personally recommend that you read a summary of the story before you play the game. If you don't know the story before playing the game, then you will probably not get the story.

And that's it. Other than the story not being well-told, there's nothing genuinely wrong with this game. All in all, F.E.A.R. is a great game. Get your copy today."
76561197963900182,1559764594,True,"PROS: Visually impressive for its time and to an extent today, combat makes you feel like Jet Li, great level design, overall fun.

CONS: Scares can become predictable, not much replay value unless you found the first time just that good.

F.E.A.R. goes places a lot of shooters haven't gone since. It boldly jumps the line between action and horror in brilliant and deceptive ways thanks to its fantastic level design, drawing your attention where it needs to be drawn for the creep factor, and setting you up in fun arenas with tons of debris and ragdoll effects for your firefights.

I first played this game shortly after it originally came out in 2005, and immediately loved it. The highly mobile state of objects and environments is immediately eye-catching, especially during shootouts, and the its influence from popular action movies of the time like the Matrix trilogy certainly shows. Adding to the beautiful chaos of the combat is the mix of melee maneuvers one can perform by jumping, running, and sliding, as well as the wide variety of weapons and shameless gore. Shotguns will occasionally reduce enemies to a fine paste or blow them in half, the penetrator impales foes to the objects or walls behind them, and as for the particle cannon, I'll leave that as a surprise to you.

The horror elements of the game are set against backdrops that are immediately familiar to modern players, tossing out antique Victorian or ""classical"" environments in favor of urban ruin and modern offices after dark. If you're like me and consider jump-scares to be nothing but cheap, predictable surprise tactics, you may find yourself disappointed in places. But it's the unresolved mysteries and the dancing shadows that really make this side of the game shine. As the plot unfolds and you start to understand what's taking place, the sensation doesn't really go away.

Visually, this game holds up surprisingly well in 2019. Chunky geometry aside, the lighting effects are gorgeous, and the fireworks displays that come out of your adventures in bullet-time are dazzling. The play-time isn't terribly long, but the expansions are bound to keep you going for awhile. How much those two stack up to the base game, I leave to your discretion, especially considering neither of them are cannon in light of the more recent sequels, Project Origin and FEAR 3."

76561198015031154,1559253660,False,"It's soooooooo boring
Ok, look. I get that it might have been a fine game when it came out back in 2005, but it just doesn't hold up (at least to my standards). I mean if you want to go through 6 hours of empty tight hallways and dumb a.i., all covered by a not at all interesting plot, be my guest! 
Everything looks ugly. And i don't mean that things look like polygons, the whole game is a variation of grey, black and red. The weapons are ugly, the character models are ugly the scenario specially is ugly. It doesn't help the fact that levels in this game are always rundown buildings, sewage treatment plants or underground facilities (the only level that is pleasing to the eye is the office building and even that one is ugly by the end of it).
 As i played the game i started to wonder what was going through the developers minds when they were designing the levels. Did they really think that making the player go through dark lit hallways, parking lots, ventilation pipes, underwater tunnels,and yellow stairs over and over again would keep him engaged? Oh but don't worry, they did not forget to place, every now and again, a phone or notebook that triggers a little piece of audio that may or may not contribute to the story. I mean, they needed to break the pace a little, or the players might have a heart attack from the thrilling experience of killing the same bot for the 10000 time.
Speaking of combat in this game, it's boring. You will always be fighting the same enemies with some slight variations here and there. It will either be a few enemies in a corridor or a slitghly larger amount in a big room!
The story is ok. It's not bad, but by the time i had found all the answers i didn't really care. Also, it has the same issue that i have with other games, which is that whenever the story is progressing and the character has to get to point A or B there will usually be some dumb setback like the power is down or the door is locked which serve simply to pad the runtime and that does not contribute to the story at all.
The game isn't scary. 
To sum it all up, when i decided to buy this game i was wanting to try something new, and saw a lot of people talking really well about it, so i bought it along with it's expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. In the first half of the game i tought it was ok, until i realized that that was it. It didn't built any suspense, it didn't got harder, it didn't got scary and it didn't change. By the second half i just wanted it to end. It felt more like a chore than anything. And now that i have finished the main game, i have no interest in playing the expansions and i certainly have no interest in trying the sequels.

76561198126606715,1558562005,False,"All in all, not worth the play time as it's mostly just grind with the same weapons against the same enemies in the same corridors.  The horror parts of the game were nicely put together but were so few and far between that they lost impact, eventually becoming a bland part of the grind.

Credit to the ones that coded the enemy logic but curse them in the same breath for giving the enemies that most deplorable of qualities - a will to live.  After getting tired of the grind I wanted to breeze through the rest to see if it perked up, however the enemies refused to obligingly line up in front of my gun but instead forced me to ferret them out.

Amongst that I also got the impression that the game really wanted to showcase its dust effects because one stray bullet in a wall put out a smoke-bomb's worth of opaque dust.  Far too much time was spent waiting for that to slowly clear before getting to continue the grind."
76561198070236191,1558561691,True,"F.E.A.R. is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed despite a rough start. I understand why it is considered a classic, and found myself enjoying just about every moment of it once I got a notorious FPS bug fixed, which thankfully is quite easy to resolve. 

The game is definitely a game of its era and plays and feels like a game from 2005, but it is also surprisingly intense. The horror is genuinely unsettling and scary and this is the first game in years where the climax was so intense I could feel myself sweating. I have not played all of the first expansion pack and none at all of the second one, but I will happily play them when I revisit this game. I see myself playing this game a few more times.

This game is so brilliant. The timing, atmosphere, and characters all add up to one of the finest games I have ever played. 

The AI is some of the smartest I have ever seen. They will flank you, they will look for cover, and they will kill you successfully more than a few times.

F.E.A.R. is a game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and Sierra

The game offers some nice graphics and a beautiful aesthetic which is pleasant all the same and has some amazing attention to detail even though it is a little rough around the edges

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless and ends just at the right time

F.E.A.R. overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is a great horror game to play in short bursts!

76561198055712109,1557909489,True,"I unironically think to myself ""they really don't make games like this anymore"" about once every 10 minutes playing this game, it's by far the most annoying millennial thought process I've ever had (despite being 19 years old)"
76561198151053137,1557878702,True,"Without a doubt, this game is one of the best games I have ever played. The gunplay in this game is absolutely perfect. The hipfire isn't too accurate or inaccurate, the gameplay feels smooth. The game is also very visually appealing. The game's AI is probably the best there is in a FPS at the moment. It uses a very simple AI system that was executed so perfectly that it makes the AI feel like it's 4 years ahead of what we have now in 2019. The game also makes use of a slow-mo mechanic that enhances the special effects of the game. Not only is the slow-mo feature the only thing keeping you alive (because the AI is so goddamn smart it's impressive), but it also makes it so the game looks 10x more beautiful while you're blasting your way through everything to the point you can't help but stop and admire how beautiful it looks. If you play the game with no slow-mo, then it's a super fast-paced combat game that's a non-stop adrenaline rush. My only issues with this game is they give you too much health kits and ammo, but they fix that problem in FEAR: Extraction Point. The one other issue that they didn't fix in extraction point is that the game didn't have too much story until the end, but once it got near the end, there was a good deal of background lore revealed about both you and the story's main plot.

In FEAR: Extraction Point, they take nearly all of the problems about the original FEAR and improve upon them. They add mechanics such as kicking open doors to add more 'flow' to the game, and they reduce the amount of ammo and health kits you find to add more challenge to the game. Around 3/4 through the game I found myself nearly out of ammo, out of health kits and only a few explosives left. They also added a new gadget: a throwable sentry turret that's extremely fun to use. Unfortunately, this game is lacking in story more than the original FEAR, but it's still a great game. I give it a 10/10."

That being said, the gunplay is truly excellent. Bullets have impact and accuracy. Enemies and yourself can only take a small amount of damage so every firefight has consequences. The lighting and physics effects were miles ahead of its time.

The best part of the game is truly the story. I mean this has obvious overtones of The Ring, but I have never had so many jump scares in my life. Not that there are a lot of things jumping out at you, but the timing of those events is brilliant. Step off a ladder and you might be surprised who is waiting for you at the bottom. 

The ending was fantastic as well. I really implore you to finish it and see for yourself. 

9.5/10 - A truly brilliant and memorable game."
76561198055052357,1556398905,True,"So to be short, sweet, and to the point: F.E.A.R. is a REALLY REALLY good FPS game with a slow-down mechanic that sells the entire game. The story isn't very amazing from the get-go (I skipped all the Audiologs & Datalogs as a FYI), but I could see it being fairly unsettling if you dig deep into it.

My only recommendation is to bump the difficulty to max (Or higher than normal), as that feels like the intended way to play. Sure you can blow through easy enemies in slow motion, but it's so much more fun and rewarding the other way around. When your life ends in one or two bullets that means you have to make the most of every situation (and abuse the heck out of the slowdown). Slowdown is broken to the point that this game is one of the easiest FPS games you will ever play with it. But on the flipside (with the difficulty turned up), it's the only thing keeping you alive.

* Pros
+ Absolutely amazing atmosphere with its harsh shadows

+ You can bicycle kick enemies
+ Level design and A.I. mix to create amazing gameplay
+ Really good at making you feeling on edge
+ All the guns are very satisfying to use
+ Bullet time is great
+ You can dual wield pistols

* Cons
- You have to dig and look for the story. But its there
- All the difficulties except ""Extreme"" is too easy (for the most part, Extreme is a fun challenge)
- I cannot for the life of me to get the expansions to work (though I did enjoy what I played of Extraction Point)
- You can't get FEAR 1 by itself, only through the FEAR Complete Pack

If you want F.E.A.R. , one of the best FPS games ever made, pick it up on GOG because of big dumb Warner Bros.

At first I wasn't convinced by the cheap scares and slow pace, but as the game progressed, the more I came to love F.E.A.R.

[b]The Great:[/b]
++Game looks exceptional with brilliant particle effects and lighting
++Perfect performance on my system, playing at 4K. Zero tweaking necessary.
++Gunplay is immensely satisfying and unique. Holds up very well.

[b]The Good:[/b]
+Guns all feel unique to each other and require correct usage suited for each environment and enemy type
+The slow mo is actually helpful and doesn't feel like a gimmick
+Health and reflex (slow-mo) upgrades scattered around the levels make for fun, worthwhile collectibles
+The impact you can have on the environment feels somewhat realistic and is still unparalleled by the vast majority of shooters out
+AI is fantastic. The way they react to bullets is satisfying and they do things you won't see enemies do in any other game. I do wish they did these things more, though.
+The soundtrack is pretty good
+Sound design is really good
+The kung-fu melee moves are actually useful and feel great to pull off
+The hardest difficulty is for the most part, satisfyingly challenging

[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]
+-I like the interesting focus on infantry combat with the occassional twist of other enemy types in the mix, but some of the other enemy types were really fun to fight and I wish they were just a bit more prevalent
-+Actually has a sense of humour, which is lost in shooters nowadays, which I like. Except this probably isn't the game that should have it as it feels out of place admist all the horror.
+-No real reason to replay, except that the game's really damn good

[b]The Bad:[/b]
-I wish some weapons were introduced earlier or were more common as you rarely get the chance to use a few of them, even more so since you have a 3 weapon limit and therefore weapons with less around use and ammo will likely be dropped first, no matter how interesting they are
-The beginning is a bit of a drag. You're stuck fighting mostly infantry and a less mobile bullet sponge enemy and the horror doesn't seep in until later, making it feel like a pace wrecker more than anything actually horrifying.
-Could've done with a bit more environmental variety. I like the urban setting but there's just a few too many same old apartments.
-It's a decent length but I could've done with a chapter or two more
-It's not very scary. Only one jumpscare got me in the whole game. However, the atmosphere does grip and that's good enough for me.
-Ending is a bit anti-climactic, even with the big set piece, and ends on a cliff hanger
-Your hitboxes are quite large. Even though you think you're in cover, sometimes you'll still get hit. This is rare though, so really just a nitpick critcism.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
It's interesting in that it retains old school FPS elements such as on-the-fly tactical FPS gameplay through enemy prioritisation and distinct weapon usage, yet adds its own spin on the formula with its over the top carnage and infantry focused combat more often than the constant balance between enemy types found
in games like Halo and DOOM. Along with this still fresh gameplay formula it adds horror and John Woo style carnage that both hold up well today. These things make F.E.A.R. a classic that still remains new and exciting today."

76561198046455935,1555446688,True,"F.E.A.R. Is it worth a buy?!
This game is pretty good. put off the graphics. the actual gameplay is pretty good, took me 13.3h to complete, but I was dragging time around with a lot of quick loads because I like to not take a lot of damage in those type of games. Note I was playing on the hardest difficulty and I must say it was very very fun to play. It kinda needs more guns, but it's minor as compared to the smart AI that won't just run through the corner. And even if he does, he'll nail a few shots on you before you can even kill it. YES even with slowmo (it's kinda hacks tho, but you got time hack which is like way better).
The story and the scary parts were meh. I got scared maybe once or twice but for me the scary parts were more like a chore than anything else.
Overall though good quallity FPS shooter.
7.8/10 Very good."

76561198278423181,1555388536,True,"F.E.A.R. : For me very little can be described on what exactly makes F.E.A.R. a masterful experience the constant intense close quarters combat, the outstanding A.I. , and the environment that you can look back at after an engagement and say ""Now THAT'S alota damage!"" This experience will forever have a place in my heart as that one game series I first found out about from Tats TopVideos' #6th entry on the Top 22 Scariest Glitches in Games back in my earlier years.

F.E.A.R. : Extraction Point: To begin with the game doesn't support a high enough resolution for a full screen experience for me and not to mention that this game has the most lag this series has to offer so just adjust your video settings for this one probably. Other than that it really is a good game that has the same gameplay as the first and also does a good job at intensifying the horror and action aspect throughout the game while continuing the story of F.E.A.R.

F.E.A.R. : Perseus Mandate: No technical problems for me on this one (except small lag here and there but its fine) and it also supports full screen resolution which is great. The game overall is alright (of course same gameplay as others but in a new story perspective) with a new weapon that completes the rate of fire archetypes yet unfortunately a more horror focused intensity increase rather than also including as much action."
76561197985889962,1555379224,True,"Note: I don't play online/multiplayer, so this review is only based on the single player game.

This is one of the few games I'll reinstall every year to play thru. 8/10.

AI - Pretty good. AI won't rush into your line of sight, will attempt to flush you out with grenades, will attempt to flank you) which gives a nice challenge. Unfortunately you can hear their chatter, and it will clue you in on what they are going to do.

Weapons - You can only carry 3 weapons along with 3 types of throwable explosives. There aren't many sniper type weapons in the game unless you consider the Penetrator as one, but you won't have many large areas where it would advantageous. A few of the heavier weapons you won't find much ammo for, but all the weapons are useful. Even duel-wielding pistols is usable throughout the game if you can keep finding ammo for it.

Level Design - If there's anything I would mark this game down for, it's the linear design. There's only one way to go, with no real multiple paths. Sure sometimes you can go thru a window to get into a room rather than the door, and sometimes a hallway goes around a set of cubicles, but that's about it when it comes to choices. As the game takes place in poorly lit corridors for the most part, and a lot of it looks the same, you can get turned around from time to time when needing to backtrack thru an area.

Atmosphere - The games does quite good in instilling a creepy vibe. Sometimes you'll see something walking by out of the corner of your view, turn around and it disappears. The developers did a pretty good job with that.

If you have difficulties playing this game the first time, don't forget to use your SlowMo. I find it's best to hide behind cover, glance to see if your target is just in view, then hit SlowMo and come out guns blazing. Unless you see another enemy there, turn off SlowMo while running back to cover. It's hard to play this game as a stealth game. You can sneak up and knock someone out, but usually that will alert the others in the area."

76561197988747200,1555299623,False,"this game is actually not good at all its rather turdy. when it first came out it was marginally interesting because you could go into slow motion like the matrix and the AI was better than other games of the time. there was also some physics type spit like breaking boards to get through boarded up doorways and ceiling lights swinging around when a grenade goes off. there are a few somewhat interesting weapons but nothing to really write home about. the most interesting weapon in the game is just some plasma rifle that turns people into skeletons. other than that its just a bunch of made up guns that do barely any damage. even though the enemies are just normal human beings it takes like 3 shots from a 12 gauge shotgun to the head to kill someone. the gameplay sucks the entire game is just running through the same generic levels shooting things til a nuke goes off which nobody seems to care about at all. randomly you enter an endless black room with flames around you to prevent you from moving and you have to shoot ghosts with a pistol. the lauded ai is so stupid in reality that if you stand on one side of a bulletproof glass window and they can see you they'll try to throw a grenade sometimes and it'll just hit the window, fall to their feet and kill them. retarded storyline makes no sense and is never explained really. there's also like 5 different enemies in the game."

Not to mention the standard controls are beyond fucked compared to what we know now. However, somehow FEAR 1 manages to still have some of the best AI enemies of any game I own and is a feat that has been not only yet to be beaten, but seems to be an art lost to time.

76561198064818859,1553554508,True,I had a lot of fun with this game and that is coming from someone who usually doesn't bother with horror games. The combat is great even if it is old and really holds up. The story was really fun and interesting. It's worth the buy. I'd give it a 6/10. It's an above average game.
76561198066618031,1553291971,True,"The most fun I've had with a shooter in a long time. It feels unique and innovative despite being more than a decade old. The AI is challenging and the harder difficulties are very well balanced, if a little unforgiving. They'll flank you, pin you down with suppressing fire, or try to flush you out with grenades rather than come around the corner where you're waiting for them. Their voice lines are done well and really add to atmosphere when you're fighting. They'll communicate and give orders when attacking, or curse and call for reinforcements when you get the upper hand with a surprise attack.

I was worried the horror aspect would be all jump scares and excessive blood, and while there was plenty of the latter the overall atmosphere was probably my favorite part of the game. Use of sound, or lack thereof, really ramps up the tension in the dark and claustrophobic sewers and warehouses. On higher difficulties, where moving through these areas too quickly will get you ambushed and killed before you can react, it really put me on edge. There are a TON of things you can see happening in the corner of your eye, or hear just around the corner. Many of these only serve to build tension, but just often enough they signal something that will actually kill you, and that note of unpredictability keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The only issues I had with the game were the inability to sprint or bash doors open, and those were mildly annoying at worst. 

F.E.A.R. is a very well done single-player shooter that I will probably replay quite a bit for the gunplay alone. It's an excellent mix of feeling dangerous and being in danger. The game took me a little over 8 hours to beat, not including DLC. It's no longer for sale individually on Steam, but if you can pick it up on Humble Bundle or Fanatical for less than $10 I'd say it's absolutely worth it.

Extraction Point is the first DLC, and it takes everything good about the base game and cranks it up to 11. The fights come faster and tougher, and I caught myself grinning more than a few times even when I was stuck on a particularly tough one. The new environments give you more options, and even replaying the same short sections from a save never feels stale. There are new guns and new enemies, and they all fit into the game extremely well. They even added the ability to bash doors in, making clearing rooms unbelievably fun. I enjoyed it more than the base game, though I recommend starting there to learn the controls and get a feel for the game first."

-Extremely repetitive
-Most weapons don't feel very good

-Graphics aged like milk, environments are extremely boring

Fights in this game are just really fun, and it carries the entire experience. It feels really good to shoot stuff, and the game is built in a way to make fighting it's enemies as cool as possible. I keep coming back to this and I keep talking about it.

Update: This is by and far the best FPS AI of all time. People will stand up for classic Halo design, but it isn't diversity in encounters that FEAR provides; it's diversity of outcomes. Loading a quicksave and taking a fight 10 times in the row will have the AI acting so absurdly unique between all attempts means that the developers didn't make this part unique by enemy placement, pacing and such. Fighting the replicants in FEAR is inherently interesting, and years later no game his really hit this nail on the head.

Every playthrough is different. Every fight is unique. Every victory feels earned. These clones feel more human than most game enemies.

Buy FEAR on GOG or Humble Bundle standalone if need be, and keep an eye on Trepang2."

Fight your way through the Armacham facilities to unwind a tense story, parts of which have effectively incorporated some the best traits of Half-Life's influence. LithTech Jupiter EX is still more than capable of providing some eye candy even years after the title's release.

The atmosphere is great. It doesn't make me sh*t my pants but Im playing pretty careful.
The AI in this game is pretty good, it's not like an enemy will keep waiting in the same spot for you to come and kill it.

No real idea yet what the story is about but I'm sure it will unfold as I keep playing.
Other than that, it's a typical shooter with bullettime but it doesn't feel lame to me.
For some reason though, when I shoot a certain automatic, it feels like the triggerbutton is sticking for a bit.
Gives a weird feel to it.
But it's alright.
I'm playing on moderate difficulty and it offers me enough challenge this first playthrough to keep me interested.

I wish I had more interest in it when it just came out but I'm glad I got the chance to play it in 2019 and appreciate it.
I'm a gameplay over graphics kinda guy but the graphics are not bad at all, it's just a bit dated obviously.
As long you're not nitpicking over graphical details this is quite a game to enjoy.

Now the only problem with this game is that many of the maps and areas in the game looks the same so there aren't much in the way of variety in the game but the combat and the enemies are so enjoyable that you won't notice it untill your second playthrough.

76561197993317783,1551521223,True,"I'll say it: this is an underrated gem that needs to be recognized as a classic. F.E.A.R is so ahead of its time it's still holding up and kicking ass to this day. The campaign is fun and very atmospheric. The gunplay is incredibly fun, not only do the guns and bullet time feel good but the environment around you will react to your shooting: papers will fly, cabinets will fall, walls break, etc. The best part? The AI is incredible. They'll constantly looking to flank and corner you, calling for back up as they dive and hide from your fire. Finally, and this isn't as important (it's my personal commendation) but the lighting is damn good. Props to the team that made this! 
It does show its age however, as you do have to patch the game yourself in order to fix a major fps bug. I also ran into 2 other bugs: one, a visual glitch where certain effects (gas leaking, electricity) literally tear the game a bit - small white ripples that constantly flash towards the direction of the effect.  Two,  a bug where I couldn't get out of water by simply jumping out of it. I had to jump backwards to get onto land. I heard that the game is not suited for 1080p, so maybe that's why I ran into those bugs.

Regardless, I give this game a 9/10, it's become one of my favorite shooters of all time. Highly recommended!"

76561198219635245,1551141264,True,"Suprisingly great game. Even now, a really fun shooter. 
FEAR gets all the important stuff right. the shooting is visceral, enemies explode in a cloud of blood when you blast them with a shotgun up close. Movement options go beyond most games of this type, with multiple melee options, including a jumping kick. obviously the bullet time is a great mechanic, and the gameplay is designed very nicely around it. The game can be pretty challenging, but never feels unfair or poorly designed. A highlight is the enemy AI, which is still impressive in 2019.

It's a little unfortunate that the horror elements are pretty lame. Constant jumpscares, usually not very effective and often pretty silly. The actually tense parts are during combat, and i don't think a scary little girl is really a necesarry addition. 

This is one of the best first person shooters out there though, even if the experience is slightly cheapened by the underdeveloped horror aspect."

The Slo-Mo is super well done in this game. The sound design and AI are pretty well done for a game of this age, and it doesn't look so bad either. Story is pretty good, but most of us know what's coming anyway. Biggest gripe would be fighting the big Mech enemies. They just are not fun to fight. Snag this baby on a sale, and have a blast turning guys into a red mist in slow motion. Instant classic."

Years after I last set foot on Steam (practically) I am back as an adult (lol) bearing a college degree on communication, cinema, with a tiny, just tiny understanding of the philosophies of media and with a brand new gaming laptop that I have brought not to play the latest and brightest but to facilitate the return to my true passion: narrative in gaming, game studies and the bliss of experiencing this beautiful and fruitful art form. Also I write critique now. 
I had never played F.E.A.R before. I remember always finding the box art so alluring and mysterious. I played the demo to F.E.A.R 2, Project Origin, when it came out (I just had gotten Steam then). But I had never played F.E.A.R.

As I was finishing it just now, I kept thinking of that small note in the store page pertaining to the curator sections and highlighting Rock Paper Shotgun: ""One of the 50 best FPS of all time"". And I was thinking ""Well, of course it is"".
Now this is coming from someone just playing this for the first time in 2019. But it is clearly a fantastic game, no doubt, and a labor of art. Also, it is clearly a game from the Half-Life school, and it shows, or the congruences are just too awesome. The infinite corridors, mazes inside buildings, caves, vents (of course), sewers, pipes - Oh, that finale, inside huge reactor coffins, walls stretching sky high and hell-low, elevator pits so deep you cannot see where it ends. Hell, wood boxes all over textured with TOP SECRET in red diagonal. The silent protagonism, that creepy story being peppered through audio diaries, a trope I just can't get enough of when it comes to this (golden) age of games. And all this architecture, an architecture of meandering mazes and spirals, an architecture of distrust, paranoia and espionage. Just look at the official store synopsis: 

[quote=Steam] A mysterious paramilitary force infiltrates a multi-billion dollar aerospace compound, taking hostages but issuing no demands. The government responds by sending in a Special Forces team only to have them obliterated. Live footage of the massacre shows an inexplicable wave of destruction tearing the soldiers apart. With no other recourse, the elite F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) team is assembled to deal with the extraordinary circumstances. They are given one simple mission: Evaluate the threat and eliminate the intruders at any cost. [/quote]

Wow. Talk about a spy flick. Except in this spy flick there is no protagonism, no suave personality or side characters to bed, no pulp or phony, gratuitous twists. No, this world is as cold and uncaring as it sounds. Corporations are evil. Incomprehensible. You are a silent man constantly being ordered, set back, and ultimately betrayed to the very core of your identity as the game reveals you to be something it's not even clear on - a clone, a fake, a whatever, all it means is that you were doped (and the final audio after the credits is just another twist of the knife, claiming that you were a ""success"", used and used throughout the end.
The papers flying, the sparks scintillating in endless gunfights against endless anons. I think that's the true terror in this game, that desolation and solitude.
Like in Half-Life, but done here in a much more nihilistic tone, the little minutes that you get to spend with other, friendly, characters (you cannot touch, of course) are spent with the knowledge that they are extremely fleeting, and that you will soon be alone again against the world. In one particular sequence, where we exit the Armacham offices to go to the Origin complex by helicopter, and the helicopter is crashed by an enemy missile, this crash is almost not underlined at all, understated, as if it were *obviously* part of the motions. And of course it is, of course the transport crashes. And then, as your two surviving companions lay injured, one, the black Delta Operative assisting F.E.A.R (even this acronym) turns to the woman from your tech department and makes a couple jokes that seem very rapey, even prompting her to tell you""please stay""... God, what a scene. Reminds me of Anticitizen 1 in Half Life 2, of being forced to wade the urban mess once again leaving people behind. That's the terror here, the solitude in corridors.
There's a very creepy scene as well. Really creepy. In the first level outright, there's this big attack by Alma that liquifies everyone with you.. except this one guy that disappears... and they keep telling you his lifesigns are still transmitting, but they can't tell where he is.. you look for him everywhere, the dude is not there, they give up on him.
Later, in a totally different place in the city, they tell you his GPS unexplainably puts him near you, an impossible situation. As the wikia says ""It is never made clear exactly what happened to Jankowski."" This is truly chilling - unfortunately this kind of horror is not very much pronunciated elsewhere. The final level, unfortunately, starts to put the gears more into the Action genre than something more subdued, and it continues, I assume, on its sequels.

Still, what a fantastic shooter, and a fantastic game. It's all about the vibe, truly. The gunplay, the footsteps of your enemies, that tantalizing sight of a city street and normalcy as you plunge yet again into a lobby with a door you gotta unlock. Health kits. Losing health points. Quicksaving often. First-Person-Shooting."

If I could say one thing that the game could be improved upon, it would be that the world could be better populated.  Not just by people but more objects in certain places and less in others.  A place that has been abandoned for years would seem like either lots of belongings left behind or possibly more things to indicate the coming and going of squatters or the homeless people.  

Either way, the game has stood the test of time and I would consider this a classic in many ways, from the story to the level layout, to the AI and difference in kind as the game progresses.

While these problems are fixable they are not the only reasons i do not recommend this game. As said before the game did not age well, the audio is bad (which i usually do not care about since i usually can understand what they are saying but it sounds like almost every person especially the main villain sounds like he is mumbling under there breath and i cant understand them half the time.) now this would be easy to fix, just use subtitles, that does not work well since the subtitles do not adapt to your resolution, I am using a 27"" 2k monitor and cant read them unless I am almost touching the screen with my face. The game play is not that great, I do like the slow-mo action, but that is about it. The grenades are bad in this game (they seem to roll and bounce a lot unless you hit an enemy with them, however the NPCs have the aim of the gods and seem to be able to make the grenades not move after they hit the ground.)

EDIT: im an old ass man at the ripe age of almost thirty and I'm still replaying this game to this day. It's the most timeless shooter ever. A god among single player shooters. 


This game is still relevant to me and I remember when you needed a cutting edge computer for this absolute glory of a title. It's beautiful in every single way and since I first played the demo as a wee lad to my bitter old age, I never found love and I wanna say the closest thing i have experienced is playing this game at any given time. What I am trying to tell you is that Im using this updated review to announce that I'm getting married to FEAR 1 (2005)

You may play this game with my blessing but you can't marry it because it's already my perfect bride and I'll die on this hill."
76561198136083090,1549318559,True,"One of the best games I've ever played. The atmosphere sucks you right in, the weapons have this feeling of power to them, and the gameplay mechanics tie it all together. Add on top of that an impressively adaptive enemy AI and the replay value of this game is amazing. The balancing is perfect in every way. The game provides you with just enough resources to survive each fight if you use your head and unlike many games today, every weapon has a place in the game. There isn't any single weapon I can honestly say isn't good. Play this game."
76561197997924174,1549283630,False,"I don't understand peoples adoration of this game, it seems ancredibly average in prospect and the story is very predictable.
Extraction Point is probably my favourite in that it is concise and not relatively long. The series changes franchise which just results in some seriously convoluted conclusions and I did not find it enjoyable at all."
76561198047762652,1549264817,True,"Very good game.
I have a few main complaints and they really don't matter all too much.
1) You run as slow as fat albert
2) The variation in level design and to an extent, textures is somewhat limited. I kept seeing the same magazines and calendars all over the damn place. Surely somebody has a calendar filled of tigers or something idk instead of a wrench.
3) LAN multiplayer doesn't work either, not just internet multiplayer so don't buy this if you had that in mind.
4) Obviously you can't buy this directly anymore but that's why third-party websites exist.

This game features a cute girl that keeps following you but since you're a big guy you're not allowed to touch her and she isn't allowed to touch you otherwise you die or something and some of your comrades don't understand this so they disintegrate.
Also, this game features soldiers that aren't completely brain dead or rely on sheer numbers like in call of duty, battlefield, or half-life 2 and on the other hand I can't think of a single weapon in this game that sucks. Even your melee attacks are actually decent if you're willing to use them.
Basically, for a first person shooter. It does what a first person shooter needs to do right. Shooting.
Also, this story is unique in the way that you can follow most of what's happening even if you have your audio off most of the time.
If you're worried about running this. So long as your laptop is something like a dell latitude e6410 or a similar variant running on Intel HD graphics, it will run well enough on low settings."
76561197996938952,1549216794,True,"I am not exaggerating when i say that this game, when released, was about as ground-breaking as Half-Life was.
It is also one of the very few games that got horror right. These aren't jumpscares, they are nightmares that creeps under your skin. The story of Alma got me prety heavily invested. The gunplay was supperb and the AI are among the smartest and most tactical ones you will find. They require sneaking and tactics to get past, and aren't your averange bullet sponge roadblocks.
With all this said, this game isn't playing too well with modern systems. For example EAX is a requirement in order to get the sound to not be completely lifeless, but is officially unavailable on anything past Windows XP. You will also have to tweak the ini settings file a bit to get it to run like it should.
A great game, betrayed by it's sequals that are, in my oppinion, trash.
A re-make of this game would be the best way to revive this series."
76561198259497838,1549157341,True,"A good survival fps.

Unfortunately for me when I start playing it its fine but after half an hour or so it slows right down I get drag so I had to stop playing.
Its still a good game I recommend that you get the colection some people might not get the issue."
76561198034935991,1548828150,True,"F.E.A.R. is a very special game for me. I remember I built my first PC in order to play it, fitted it with a shoddy GPU and couldn't play the game at all. Only after a long time I could play it and only now, after finishing it for the second time, I'll write a review. 

The story, atmosphere and characters are unforgivably good. There's plenty of scares that probably will make you sleep a night or two with the lights on, specially because the setting of the game is so terrifying. I'll refrain from commenting about it, just trust me, you'll want to play the sequel as soon as you finish this game because the story is THAT good, though the narrative could be better.

The graphics are good though you'll get tired of the samey corridors, textures and scenarios throughout the game. The sounds are good and certain to make you jump from your chair, specially when the character's foot bump into stuff in a dark corridor. Play the game with your headphone on for maximum effect. Since the game has been released in 2005, of course the game has bullet time to slow down things and make you shoot the enemies like the killing machine you are. The weapons are interesting and fun to use, specially the 10mm HV Penetrator that pins the enemies to the wall and the Type-7 Particle Weapon, that will desintegrate the flesh of the enemies, leaving only the skeleton as a reminder of how badass this weapon is. If that isn't enough for you, you can also unleash some sick martial moves. It feels great to move around and shoot the bad guys. It's worth mentioning that you can even lean left/right to attack without exposing yourself out of cover. 

F.E.A.R. has the one of the best AI I've ever encountered in a game and this is one of the best features of the game in my opinion, along the excellent story/setting/experience. The enemies have a very satisfying sense of awareness and will engage you using different tatics to overpower you such as providing supressing fire to create oportunities to flank your position, flush you out of hiding using grenades and constantly moving around to make themselves difficult to be fired upon. If you try to mindlessy fight them head on, you'll certainly have your ass handed back to you. It's SO satisfying to fight such an advanced AI at the same time you'll still feel like you're playing a videogame, not a tryhard military combat simulator that we see left and right in nowaday's games.

Playing this game is a throwback experience I recommend to everyone that has grown up playing horror games. Playing it will make you feel tense and even emotionally exausted, given how you'll be on the edge while dealing with the AI, the scary atmosphere and the story developments, specially during some sequences that will leave you wondering if any of that was real or just your character's imagination.

To sum it all up, the story is SO darn good, the atmosphere is nerve wrecking, the enemies are formidable and it's pure fun to jump into this insanity. F.E.A.R. is a must play for any FPS fan, no matter how much of a scaredy cat you are."

76561197989265915,1548506418,True,"This was a great game in its day, the melee actions tied with the adrenaline soaked slo-mo action certainly was the best part. AI do not do the same actions over and over again unlike many other fps games out there keeping the gameplay a little fresh. 

The story is solid, seems a little dis-jointed but that's the point the characters are a tad cray cray. Moderate jump scares nothing too bad.

Only play on the hardest difficulty available.

Multiplayer was fun at the time and then went on to a free to play as F.E.A.R Combat (Obviously since the Gamespy shut-down MP is no longer available) I honestly can't believe it's nearly a 14 year old game.

F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. Extraction Point the first expansion suffers from age as they do not perform well on Windows 10 and requires several tweaks to get it running ok without crashing too often and the framerates can be woeful at times, the second expansion Perseus Mandate however performs well with none of the flaws from the first 2 parts.

Imagine the type of unholy offspring you'd get by combining slo-mo John Woo style action with Japanese horror.

The AI is some of the most intelligent and dangerous I've played in an FPS, the horror is well-implemented, the plot is engaging, the gunplay nice and satisfying, and for its time, a rather pretty FPS.

My suggestion: it is advisable you do your business before playing this game, turn out all the lights, and get engrossed. You'll thank me later.

76561198063626926,1548073917,True,"Played through the base game of Fear and the Extraction Point DLC, and I have to say it's a great experience.
 
 The base game is amazing and still holds up today, it's chaotic, fun and makes the player feel like a badass. And if your playing on the hardest difficulty Fear can be very strategic. This game does a great job setting up a creepy and unnerving atmosphere and the lighting is top notch for the time. The base game alone is worth a playthrough and Extraction Point is for anyone who enjoyed the mechanics and feel of FEAR and wants another couple of hours of being pointman. Although I have heard bad things about Perseus Mandate I tried to play it but it had some sort of resolution bug making it unplayable for me but theres most likely a fix.

 I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games really, it's one of those classic games that you need to try."

That aside, a pretty good game for the time it was released out. Especially light bending near explisions and shadows.
The AI deserves praise as well, I get a feeling it's better than in F.E.A.R. 2.
The only issue I might have is the limitation to 3 weapons, which makes ammo management a pain and lack of more varied enemy types.
Classic FPS despite that, beeing closest probably to Half-Life 1."

76561198139779484,1547136583,True,"Do I recommend F.E.A.R.? Well, kinda. I recommend the game for the gameplay and atmosphere. The story is interesting at times but in the end I was bored by it and as for the horror element in the game, when it's good it's unsettling and when it's bad it's because is the same from beginning till end. A spooky, goth girl can be frightening only a handful of times. Also it doesn't help when you are OP from the start, I can't experience fear when I know that i'm Neo.

The gunfights are incredible and dynamic, the enemy AI is smart enough to keep things interesting. When you shoot a wall you see particles fly in the air, it's really amazing... and repetitive. As much as I love the gameplay, in the final chapters of the game I just wainted it to be over.

The aesthetic of game is great... but it's no Bioshock or Half-Life. There was no variety and that made things stale.

I know that this review seems kinda negative (and it is) but this game was hyped to me a lot and in the end it didn't met the expectations. I 'm just trying to ground it a bit if you are interested to play it for the first time. It's good and at times even great but not a masterpiece. Give it a try and see for yourself.

PS. I finished it today and I have no interest to continue the story. I will though (because I bought the trilogy bundle) but not immediately and especially not because I care about the story. Just because I have it in my library and by the way, don't buy the game from Steam -_-, it's expensive even on sale for such an old title and you can't buy it separately from the others.

76561198013136696,1546711675,True,"It's dull. It's gray and brown. Its level design is unspectacular. Its story is not stellar either. Its horror bits do somewhat enhance the atmosphere and reinforce the plot, but only barely so. Its AI is in all honesty is not as brilliant upon closer examination as we all remember it. It has a few different melee attacks which are mostly useful to break vent covers. Its graphics have not aged too well.

BUT OH MY GOD THE FIREFIGHTS! They are one of the coolest FPS experiences many of us still have to this day. Sound design is on point and help accentuate this game's only strength - the combat itself. AI does a very good job at being challenging, semi-unpredictable and very, very fun to fight. It's also quite visceral - gibs are included, as is the pulverizing shotgun - not many games let you shoot your enemies into literal red mist. Weapon selection is also very decent, as are gun sounds.

This completely, unabatedly linear game with mostly indoor, almost claustrophobic environments somehow manages to make me feel like almost every combat encounter is a mini-sandbox. Probably the bullet time ability has something to do with it.

76561198133830671,1546244187,True,"Is good

Fear does a fabulous job of making you feel like a top tier badass with the few but epic ways to kill your enemy. The player is also given a very strong yet organized foe to fight against. It is quite a shame not too many people talk about how smart the AI really is. There is rarely a time an enemy is not in cover, unless they are switching to a better spot to attack the player. Sometimes they can sneak up on the player or can even be caught creeping toward you in a sneaky fashion. 

The story is okay but it is hard to say it is the best story I've heard because it is not too memorable. I just know fear as a kickass action game. 

Unfortunately with most steak there is fat with it. Fear's horror element is not the best unfortunately. I found much of the horror element kind of funny. [spoiler]Especially with the game attempting to spook me with a jpeg [/spoiler]. However it could just be me. There are some people that might find the horror element quite spooky, but if you are way too  used to horror, then this will definitely be either disappointing or funny. 

The game is also kind of dated. When playing this game on a 1080p monitor, the subtitles will appear very small. I also heard there are people that have trouble playing this game on windows 10 (big surprise). I don't know for certain though because I played this game on windows 7 and it was fine. 

In conclusion, I definitely recommend this game AS An ACTION SHOOTER. I cannot recommend this game as a horror game though, just too cliche in my opinion. Oldy but a goody."
76561198074650307,1546238878,True,"Simple in basic concept - the game's strong suit is its extremely strong combat. However, not only is the campaign short, but it's bogged down with poorly handled horror aspects and a convoluted, backwards story. F.E.A.R. feels like a game at odds with itself - on one hand it wants to be a supernatural thriller game, which could have worked out if executed in a similar way to AMNESIA. And on the other hand it is a corridor shooter with intense combat with visceral, brutal action.
To keep things short, here are the three main points:

1. Combat feels heavy, powerful, and daunting. You are compelled to peek out of cover and use your Matrix-style bullet-time to gain an advantage against your capable opponents. It's a beautiful symphony of particles, sound, and gut wrenching action. Sparks will fly, cover will crumble, and bullets feel like they have a serious impact on enemies. Blood will splatter about and bodies will drop with an eerily realistic ""flump"" when killed. Enemies will make tactical call outs and smart choices to attempt to kill you - suppressing you with intense, frightening sprays of very deadly bullets. When you close the gap and plug an enemy with a shotgun, it feels raw. When you dome the last enemy with a precise headshot - you feel like you came out of an ordeal. It's so incredible and powerful - you wish that combat was the entire game, and made with modern technology.

2. The game itself feels a bit... silly. Allies will insist that your duty is incredibly important - and then send you to kill a battalion of 1,000 soldiers all by yourself, no backup. Side characters are either moronic, or memorable because of how annoying they are. You feel no sense of sympathy or emotion towards anyone and are left baffled how the developers could imagine this plot resounding with any human being. While there are a few parts that may get a jump out of you, the senses of paranoia and suspense doesn't last - as you will feel more genuine terror and emotion while in combat with enemies than with interacting with the world.

3. While combat FEELS great - the truth about how it is applied is so simple as to be insulting. There are only a handful of weapons (8, I think). And ammo is a large thing to consider. So you end up carrying around the same 3 weapons - and combat begins to feel same-ish. I picked up a shotgun on the second level and never turned back, only utilizing the penetrating ""nail rifle"" at range or against bosses. The gameplay loop is insultingly simple and lacks variety. You round a corner, use slow-mo, and pump enemies full of lead before retreating to repeat the process. You CAN get creative, but you're going to get yourself killed - the shotgun will kill or stagger opponents with a single hit, sometimes killing multiple with a single shot - while the AR has horrible TTK and chews through ammo like none other. Because the powerful/interesting weapons have low ammo reserves and niche use - you end up sticking to the same mundane loadout because of its reliability. And some enemies are so incredibly cheap that you will rely heavily on that aspect. And while the combat can feel intense while in the moment – you will never want for medical packs. I had a constant supply of 9 and often had to burn them in order to pick up new ones.
What I ended up feeling is a craving for a different game: a hyper realistic corridor shooter with visceral combat, high particles, outstanding visual and audio fidelity, and sharp AI that is ruthless. There are glimpses of that amazing game in here, but it is smothered under an ocean of mediocre design and mundane execution. It’s a spark of an incredible idea – lost in the machinations of a purely misguided one.

76561198044285461,1546142282,False,"it's a boring linear game with balance issues. people say to play it on the hardest difficulty (""extreme hard"" or something) but it gives enemies unfair instant accurate hits and enough damages to kill in 1 hit, yet can require several headshots to die, which is very lame since fps games in which bullets actually go where the crosshair is are rare, and it feels unrewarding. some tougher enemies take nearly the entire ammo supply of a weapon and/or several explosives and cheap tactics to die

when we die, we respawn slightly backwards so we can directly get back into action and keep progressing instead of making us run for ages and lose a lot of progress like a lot of games do. it's also much less frustrating to start over like it's usually the case in single player games

the game is linear and it's 90% running around for solving puzzles (you're always getting stuck and have to figure out how to get out) and 10% shooting. i have put around 6-7 hours of real playtime into the game so far in 2 sessions and the only variation in gameplay was a 20 seconds sequence of controlling a fixed rotating robot turret once to beat enemies remotely and the environments are always the same, either industrial buildings or offices. so far i've seen 8 different weapons, with one being ""secret"" with limited ammo, another rare and with very limited ammo not meant to be used for long, and the others appearing commonly"

Why the hell wouldn't they include those fixes I don't know. Makes me feel bad for the original creators of the game, as the handling of the steam release is most likely out of their control.

The game itself is amazing. It has the best weapon feedback I've experienced in a modern fps so far. Enemies shot at point blank spin around flamboyantly. Everything in the environment flies in the air and overreacts to your shots. And the slow mo adds a ton. I can't think of any other modern fps that gets the feedback thing right the way FEAR does.

Levels get repetitive and look samey after a while, which is unfortunate because the overall atmosphere is great. When you occasionally peek out of a window or get on a balcony and get a glimpse of the outside world with its buildings and city lights you really get the sense that there's an actual world outside that get on with life unaware of the hellish conspiracy you found yourself in.

76561198225108480,1545245449,True,Well this was a super fun game but unfortunately my computer couldn’t run the game well since it’s a powerful gaming computer. But I do want to try it again eventually
76561198026461767,1545187262,True,"A well-developed FPS Horror game that is still incredibly entertaining to play through in 2018. The story is whatever. The gunplay can get tedious. And graphically, of course it’s nothing to sneeze at. But the brilliance of its environmental designs and Matrix-like fights using bullet time against its responsive enemy AI took me through the game. If you love a good scare in classic FPS form, I would highly recommend getting it on a site like GOG.com, where you don’t have to get roped into buying the trilogy for an inflated price. Many other people comment on here that the sequels are not as good, and I can’t comment on that. Play it and see. 8/10. 

++ Slick environments that were equally as spooky as they were reminiscent of the good design of Half-Life levels. 
++ SloMo combat. So much fun to use and abuse, but was a fair thing to have on your side on the harder difficulties when enemies had lazer-like accuracy and flanked you from angles you never thought possible.
++ This likely goes with environments, but the lighting throughout the game was amazing. Shadows were a little unrealistic, but added that next level of suspense and combat advantage that you never thought you needed. 
+ The basics of the story and your purpose of going through the levels is straight forward, but I appreciated the way that they communicated the game’s conflicts through messaging machines and radio broadcasts. 
+ The music was awesome. Ominous synth that was highly suspenseful. Always fit the scene. 
+ While there isn’t a crazy amount of enemy variety, their use of different weapons and playstyles surrounding them (i.e. guys with shotguns will make the most of the range of their gun and try and flank/rush you vs. riflers who will keep their distance) keep combat fresh. Also the use of unique, harder-to-kill enemies in certain points will leave you applauding the developers as they destroy your character. 
+ DLC adds another 8-10 hours minimum to the game, even if its not important to understanding the story. 
- Flashback scenes were repetitive and only served a purpose the first time they were used. Constantly repeated, and they even contained enemies that took ammo and HP out of your run through. Didn’t serve to do anything but annoy the player.
- Actual gunplay and player (not enemy) combat felt a little stale without the use of SloMo. Not as refined as what we would see in your average Battle Royale, but strongly is in line with what you’d find in CS:S or CS:GO
-- Enemies at higher difficulties just absorbed more damage. It was frustrating to see guards who wear a small bulletproof vest and a visor needing to take 3-4 headshots just to see them go down on the harder difficulty settings.

Pros
Bullet time plus excessive gore and ragdoll physics equals one mega satisfying experience
This is a fun game to play around Halloween its got plenty of spooks
The levels may be super linear but the game does give you plenty of powerups and collectibles to collect so you should still explore
I really like the fast reload animations 

Cons
The ending kinda stinks
The game adds in bullet sponge enemies to add variety but like you could probably guess their just annoying
The game has spooky hallucination moments that're mostly just there to spook you but later out of nowhere the visions will attack you and its kinda annoying considering how your vision is screwy in these bits 
I think this game would've been better without the 3 weapon rule especially considering it only has like 8 weapons 
I barely used the Frag grenades but never found a good moment to use the proximity or remote detination grenades

76561198053624818,1543986491,True,"2004 or '05 was likely the culmination of the golden era of shooting games. There is no such thing as a flawless game, but F.E.A.R. is as close as you're going to get. 

Closed binders flop open as they fall off desktops. Looking down you can catch your reflection in a pool of water on the floor. Skeletons appear to be anatomically correct down to floating ribs. Trust me, mindblowing details in 2005. For good measure this also easily outclassed the avalanche of janky cover shooters that got crapped out immediately afterward by developers. That this team could tell a story without larding the game with cut scenes or wresting control away from the player every minute is impressive, to say nothing of the combat.

It's true the AI is smart, but let's not pretend like the enemies are so brilliant they can do your taxes. The game functions so well because all the elements complement each other perfectly. Well-structured (if bland looking) level design allows both you and the enemy AI to flank and ambush, each encounter playing out noticeably different each time you repeat it.

Edit:  FEAR still holds up on additional playthroughs. However, for some reason the game has a second-long black screen every time I load into a new section and a glitched last level (Interval 11). Might be a bug tied to Windows 11 incompatibility or because of high frame rates."
76561198056228039,1543930898,True,"F.E.A.R is a game that hasn't aged brilliantly. The combat is pretty weak and the graphics are as you'd expect from a game as old as this. However, the story was really fascinating and if you're looking for something to play in your spare time I'd definitely recommend it."
76561197981605919,1543806745,True,"F.E.A.R. was engaging and fun to play even after 13 years. Despite the limited amount of weapons and enemy types, the AI and gunplay are really satisfying and tire slowly. The story is mediocre, but the character development through listening to answering machines and interactions in the game world are compelling and keep me interested to find out what happens next to them. There are echos of Half-Life everywhere you look and the game feels very similar to later Deus Ex titles -- albeit without the RPG elements.

Running Windows 10, there were no crashes during my playthrough. Monolith's custom engine, Lithtech Jupter EX, rendered accurately and dutifully on a QHD@144hz monitor. There was one bug that was quite annoying when four drones got stuck in a doorway and were shooting me through the map until I wasted an assload of medpacks and ammo killing them.

I would give this game an 7/10 now that it has aged, it isn't quite as exhilerating as I remember the first time."

76561198018412369,1543699762,True,"I am a bit disappointed with FEAR. First of all, it is an old FPS, and FPS back then didn't really have a strong narrative. It the same for FEAR. The characters and the story are not memorable, and the game is not really scary either. I suppose, you could say that it has pretty good atmosphere sometimes.

Anyway, the only thing it can offer is gameplay. Honestly, FEAR loses in both aspects (gameplay and narrative) for me, compared to Max Payne. It's a shame, considering that i heard a lot of good things about the game, like its AI or lighting. It's all true by the way, but i expected a slow motion game like max payne, but in this game, slow motion just ruins the fun in the game. Once you stop abusing it, you actually start enjoying it. They should have nerfed it, it justs lasts for too long, and you are pretty much invincible during that time.

Use it in moderation, and try to take more risks when playing. Watch the video below to get an idea.

76561198024812228,1543271014,True,"[u]FEAR[/u] is action-horror done right. You play as 'Point Man,' a special ops marksman tagged with apprehending a rogue operative who seems to be on a cannibalistic murder spree. Unbeknownst to you, there are hidden secrets of your birth that tell a tragic tale of corporate tyranny set to a backdrop of supernatural sci-fi chaos.

[u]FEAR[/u] is a game that manages to create eerie levels that suck the player into the terrifying visions of a tormented girl. The AI is phenomenal, the weapons are fun and creative, and the writers manage to take a boiler plate ""military-operation-gone-wrong-because-of-corporate-interests"" and turn it into something a little more unique by merging the FPS-action genre with supernatural horror.

I really enjoyed playing a level titled ‘Urban Decay.’ The map of the level contains a few abandoned buildings, alleyways, and adjacent housing complexes. I enjoyed it because I felt like I was exploring a concrete jungle for the first time. Enemies could come from any area, room, or crawlspace. They could set up camp in the fire escape next door or hide in a room four or five stories above you in a neighboring building to obtain a safer vantage point.

[u]FEAR[/u] is a game that rewards exploration. Take ‘urban decay’ for example. Here, every room contained something. A medical kit, weapons, reflex and/or health boosters, a crevice to flank enemy combatants -- I truly do not think there was a single ""dead end room,"" and if there were, it was very creepy, so I moved on. The weapons of the game yield countless fun. Barge into a room with a traditional gun like the RPL Sub-Machinegun, disentegrate your enemy into ash with the Type-7 Particle Weapon, or opt for the hyper-accurate, powerful classic 10mm HV Penetrator.

As an aside, the rag doll physics of dead AI are both great and hilarious. Using the 10mm HV Penetrator you could quite literally crucify enemies to walls, ceilings, and even the floor. Moreover, if you blew them up, you would either be treated to a big blood cloud, a charred skeleton, or dismembered body parts. This brings me to the broader point, which is that the AI in [u]FEAR[/u] is incredible. It will take cover, it will be accurate, it will communicate amongst itself efficiently, it will flank, it will create cover by interacting with objects in a way you cannot. The AI in [u]FEAR[/u] is lethal.

Of course, I would be remiss if I wrote a review for [u]FEAR[/u] and did not cover two of its most unique qualities: [i]reflex time[/i], and [i]Alma’s visions[/i]. Here, you can gain an edge in tough situations by activating reflex time, which slows everything down but keeps you at a slightly higher speed than the rest. Super fun to barge into rooms and immediately slow down time and clear the room. Super useful to when being swarmed by multiple ghosts. Alma’s visions are probably my favorite part of the game. They range from shy teases like messing with your radio frequency and harmless apparitions, to hospital hallways filled with blood, and a fiery oblivion where ghosts appear and rush at you.

All of this being said, it is hard to believe that I used to play the [u]FEAR[/u] franchise in my Xbox 360 almost a decade ago. I cherished the nostalgia factor of (re)playing this game, but I also genuinely enjoyed playing the game for what it's worth. I usually stray far from FPS, particularly of the multiplayer variety because they often come with a toxic community. But this is precisely why I would recommend [u]FEAR[/u]. It's more than just your typical Call of Duty or Counter-Strike rip-off, and the multiplayer function is dead. Plus it’s just a solid game."

AI in the game are stupidly smart but dumb, while they love to scream 'Flashlight!' as soon as the see the slightest light not emitted from their forces and pace around the floor trying to find any knock or shadow they can, the AI make up for their stupidity by giving you good gunfights.

What I really like about F.E.A.R is how great it looks. The graphics are clean and crisp. No post processing nonsense here. This just proves that sometimes less is better.

However, it's the atmosphere because of which I will remember F.E.A.R. The game is incredibly immersive and you will have a hard time putting it down. I enjoyed exploring the expertly crafted levels as much as I did combat.

I don't want this review to get super long, so I will give a quick summary here:
Engaging story, superb atmosphere, terrific AI, heart-pounding combat, great horror elements and of course... one of the greatest horror icons of all time, Alma. This is the recipe for a perfect game.

I'm just really sad that games like F.E.A.R aren't made today.

PS: A few words about the two expansions. They are okay, but compared to the original game, they don't feel all that special. The action is still there, but the story and level design just didn't click with me. However, Extraction Point does contain what I consider to be one of the most badass video game lines. So points (no pun intended) to Extraction Point for that. :)"

76561198043660467,1542484011,True,"Even for a more than decade old FPS title, this is a solid FPS title with satisfying shooting, incredibly intelligent AI that puts even recent shooters to shame. Won't really go into extreme detail as this is a fairly well-known title, and for recent commentary Mandalore Gaming said way more and in great detail than whatever I could put in this steam review. 

Just take this as a glowing recommendation of this title. I do have to admit, towards the end of the Base game, it really tended to be a slog.  The Expansion pack, Extraction Pack I feel is much stronger, and if you only play one F.E.A.R title, it should definitely be the way to go. Perseus Mandate, at the time of this review, I have not played and most likely will not due to the poor opinions I have read about it, and myself having my ""fill"" of the game. but who knows.

Another criticisms is that the horror aspect of the game was hit or miss with me. In the base game, it felt overdone and kind of cheap as it’s hard to get scared when you are a time slowing marine badass. Still it did set the atmosphere at times. I do feel that it was better handled in Extraction Point, along with most things. Still in the end, F.E.A.R is still worth playing, even now even though it’s over 14 years old. I had this game almost since I first made my account, and only played it just last month. Really was sleeping on a heavy weight, I was.

Essentially, F.E.A.R. is all about nailing some overactive freaks to the walls. It's not as old-school as Painkiller, though here also isn't any character progression - except collecting some syringes to improve your reflexes. Or what's actually more probable, you have a terrible drug habit and you desperately need your fix so you wouldn't start to experience <WILD ALMA APPEARS> hallucinations.

Basically more of the same thing. Um... am I supposed to finish it first?

More of the same thing. ALRIGHT, I like it more than the original. I simply find it more enjoyable. That's probably because I didnt care about using a shotgun prior to playing Extraction Point. Ever heard about a guy who claims that his dad has finished CoD only with Colt, because he didn't know that he can swap weapons? I don't believe it, either.

The story is very minor to the basic shoot 'em up style of the game. But what the story does is add a dimension of bizarre and somewhat annoying horror aspect, which is never really explained. Fortunately, as shoot 'em up's go, it is quite fine. There is an angle where the player can slow down time. But I never used it. Seemed to me to be kind of cheating with something that does not make any sense, since the game occurs in the recent past. It is a very linear path through the game. No need for walkthroughs.

76561198047626546,1541037466,True,"FEAR is not only one of the best horror games I've ever played, but it's also a great FPS. The game is thirteen years old as of writing this, so I did run into a few compatibility issues I'll list below:

1.) Resolution. This game is optimized for 4:3 resolutions, so you might have trouble getting it to work on a widescreen especially if it's a higher resolution. If you had crashing issues like me trying to change the resolution to your monitor's, I got it to work by gradually upping it until I reached my native resolution. 

2.) This only applies if you have Logitech peripherals like a mouse, but for some reason their drivers conflict with the game, resulting in unplayable performance no matter how much texture tweaking you do. Removing the Lotigech drivers ended up working for me, but if you have a nice logitech setup, I wouldn't recommend getting this game.

The only legitimate criticism I can come up with is the enemy variety could be better, the environment aesthetics are a bit too plain and samey, and the 3 gun limit is a hindrance. However those are relatively small potatoes when it's put up against everything FEAR does right. 
Also, you may have been decieved into believing this is a horror game. It really isn't. It has some quiet segments with spooky ghosts. The rest of it is white knuckle action blasting limbs off with shotguns in slow motion.

76561198025237200,1540840670,False,"The hugely entertaining modern classic FPS with horror parts that you should buy, but probably from somewhere else. I wish there was a sideways thumb, the game definitely deserves a recommend but Warner Bros honestly deserves the shaft. I'm seriously debating which thumb I should use here.

A platoon of clone soldiers and their psychic commander has gone rogue. It is up to you, the Point Man of no name and incredible reflexes, to stop them. The combat is the real meat of the game and Monolith nailed it, guns feel powerful and the encounters are often short, vicious and chaotic. Both sides can really do some terrifying damage and the Replicas will punish your mistakes, so you really need to use that famous slow-mo ability to outperform your enemy. You can even shoot the grenades as they leave the hands of you enemies, pulping the poor guy and the couple standing next to him in the process before kung-fu kicking your way through an adjacent window and tearing the wannabe flankers up with SMG fire before they can react, it's greatly entertaining stuff.

There's also the aforementioned spooky bits, often involving a little girl of standard horror movie fare, varying kinds of gory visions and even explosions and hellfire. It paces out the encounters nicely, keeping up the tension between the action and sometimes even faking you out, making you expect imminent spooks but leading you into a breather spot instead.

It even looks pretty sharp, the particle and lighting work are some top shelf material and give the game some real atmosphere. As for complaints, it does drag some areas on for too long, a couple of the encounters are a bit too trial-and-error for my taste (the part with the shutters and the mech drop in the condos mainly come to mind) and the piecemeal storytelling is frankly too bland to really keep up interest alongside the high-octane action and spooks, but it's not enough to really detract from the experience too much.


""If it's so good, then why not buy it? Surely there's some hidden gotcha involved?""

There sure is. This game used to be available for 10-ish bucks including the expansions, which made it a good deal even off sale, and when the sales dropped that >50% off it was just an absolute steal! However, Warner Bros decided to shaft the players for whatever reason (I suspect poor sales on the sequels) and removed the original bundle, nowadays you can only buy it bundled with the sequels (largely considered to be the markedly inferior games) for the price of an AAA title. You can still buy the sequels separately, just not the first game.

Supposedly there are retailers still selling F.E.A.R Platinum for the same price as always, but that's frankly outside the scope of Steam reviews and you should be able to do the research if you're interested. And you should be, it's a fantastic game."

The enemy is smart and will flank you and chase you out of cover, and since the combat is very realistic, 2 guys shooting at you in the open will probably mean your death if you don't have a plan.

I'm depressed by the first half of the toy: designers so carelessly treated their duties that the picture manages to concede even Hellgate: London =_=
Almost bald walls, minimum of foreign objects and square cars in the middle of the square courtyards make you think about the tricks of some lovers of grief. %) Fortunately, later everything falls back into place and the remnants of F.E.A.R’s former atmosphere spill onto the screen in full. Only.. in free time from shooting be in the walls of the same basements, laboratories or sewerages - very drearily. The developers, as expected, did not bother to revive the situation - there was everything that was before.

To battle all of these enemies you get a nice variety of weapons including the usual shotgun, pistol, assault rifle and smg.  But you also get some more exotic weapons like a sniper laser gun, a rail gun and rocket launcher. The biggest weapon you have to fight your enemies is your power to slow down time. When you push the control key, it slows everything down and so it allows you a quick escape or to get a few shots in real quick on an enemy.

The game is also way too easy, I played on Extreme difficulty, even disabled crosshair(it's impossible to fully disable it, but it's possible to make it 95% less visible, which is practicly invisible unless you look very closely) and still it's very easy to win all fights without even taking damage, because of how overpowered Slow-mo is.
the flashlight is the biggest nightmare in this game, it runs for way not enough time.
Wish final intervals had more much more shooting though.

Also it has 2 amazing expansion packs, I think both are even better than the main game, they have much more action and more varried level design, new enemies and weapons.

It also have a few great mods (Clone Crisis, Beneath, Resurrection Interval 1 & 2, Resurrection Interval 6, Rivarez mod)  and fan made expansions (Brutal Force, Dead Phantom)

76561198033719770,1538352833,True,"FEAR is a classic first-person shooter. It's essentially one firefight after another against squads of soldiers in warehouses - with some horror jump scares thrown in to keep it interesting and drive the plot.

Completely mindblowing graphically and highly innovative for it's time. This game has aged well, and is perhaps the gold standard in enemy AI in a first person shooter game - particularly as this is a single player campaign affair. Enemies will work together as a squad to try to determine where you are and try to lure you out. They're also capable of setting up ambushes, outflanking you, creating cover by pulling shelves over, or patiently waiting for you to make a first move. Very rarely would the player be able to easily lure angry enemies out into a single line and pick them all off with ease. Stealth play is also possible. If they don't see you, you will get to choose when and where to begin the engagement with your use of cover. One standout feature was the use of Matrix-esque ""bullet-time"" which apart from looking amazing, gave you an edge over enemies in a tight spot.

Most critical and revolutionary in this game was the little things that FEAR did right. Everything from the use of sound to determine where enemies are, gun smoke and dust obscuring your view, seeing enemy shadows against the wall before you get a visual, and your ability to figure out how many assailants are left in a squad by overhearing their comms. Then you have some well placed jump scares!

More modern multiplayer games rely on other human players, but for a single player game FEAR was a revelation. The only game that I know to come close to replicating the level of AI presented here was Rainbow Six Siege. I recommend seasoned FPS veteran players to go all out on the hard settings where their skills will really be pushed. For a good player, it is very satisfying to pick off squad after squad. For an extra challenge - limit yourself to carrying only a single med-kit at a time and forget about the bullet-time feature.

It is graphically inferior to modern titles these days - but the graphics are still great in their own way and get the job done. The maps will get a bit repetitive with it's fair share of boring generic warehouses stocked with crates however. Aside from the firefights the game does enough to mix it up a bit with different enemies, weapons, and tactics to prevent it getting stale

It's really the gameplay that shines here - and it has a great story - and it's the reason why you should play this game if you haven't already. The expansion packs give you more of the same gameplay - and in this case - it's really more of a good thing."

these days. And Fear looked like something we never had seen before! The developer Monolith Productions 
had already made a few great games and this was a new successfull one. It won prizes, like VGX Award 
- Best first-person action and many others. From that time on we could play each few years a new part
in the Fear series. Really sad that this has stopped. Still, there are 5 great games.
When you like fpshooters with great action, and fear and horror, and not to forget blood and gore. Then
Fear is really a game you have to play. It simply belongs to the top of those old best of all time shooters!

Perseus Mandate is a great expansion to this game and I'd pick that up too, that one really disturbed me at some points.  This definitely beats its sequels though.

FEAR ia conisdered by many to be one of the greatest horror FPS games of all time. And with good reason. 

Decent graphics with great animations, good voice acting and first class sound design. While the gunplay does show its age, there are still plenty of weapons with quite a unique twist from the usual smg/rifle of most games. Also the melee is very advanced with the ability to throw punches as well as flying kicks. 

However the real out standing feature is the AI - even by todays standards it is pretty advanced. It will take cover or tey to flank you. Most modern AI is more like shooting fish in a barrel. This also means the game can be quite challenging in a lot of areas. 

The horror is more the psychological type of japanese than the western, so no zombies. It is sparse and used very effectively. Pity the overall story is so damned confusing. 

Sadly the MP is now dead, and you will need to download a free fix for in game performance issues.  however the fact this also comes with the two expansions you will get a lot of great game for the money."

76561198036593258,1537732469,True,"TLDR: Yes, it's worth buying but don't give WB the wrong idea. Wait for a sale. 

When I'm absolutely disgusted with the endless stream of live-service mictrotransaction laden filth the industry churns out today, I come back to my Ageless Five: FEAR, Portal, Dark Souls, Amnesia: The Dark Decent and Deus Ex. 

Fear is a masterpiece of a Horror-FPS, the AI makes you feel like your fighting for your life on the easiest setting and on the hardest it will make you beg for it. The Environment design, at first, looks uninspired and less interesting but what Monolith accomplished with this game was making the AI work so well within this environment that it's transformative in my opinion.  The best part for me is that you can pretty much ignore the story and engage yourself with the gameplay. Just put some music on and become the shotgun. Also, the shotgun. Jesus H Christ I love this game's shotgun. Angry is the best word to describe it, it sounds like god slamming his car door and liquifying clone soldiers never gets old. 

As above right now, I don't believe you can buy the base game alone on steam and while extraction point improves on the original formula and is very much worth the money -assuming you wait for a sale-, Perseus Mandate is godawful and I wouldn't recommend the series from FEAR 1 on except for the above exception.

The various weapons you get are pretty powerful, one weapon even has enough ammo to complete the entire game with.

76561198051892133,1536728281,True,"F.E.A.R. is a good, competent, solid game, but dragged down by a massive caveat I'll get to at the end.
This game is visceral. It's hardcore. The enemy A.I. is some of the best I've ever seen in First Person Shooters, and the shooting mechanics are solid and punchy. Each weapon has real weight and punch to it, as paper flies from copy machines, plaster shoots from the walls, and lights swing back and forth during a firefight. Half the time you feel like you're in a real battle, coughing on the dust spitting up from the lead whizzing by your head. It's intense, and the action is sweet.
How's the story? It's good! It's not amazing or littered with intricate depth, and it never blew me away, but it's good. You pick up bits of the story through voicemails left on phones throughout the game, which are usually well-placed and designed to be able to listen to during a firefight or while you're waiting on something to move in-game. The story is fairly simple, but it feels complicated due to the somewhat messy way it's presented. You get bits and pieces here and there, but the game hardly gives you time to ingest the information because it's an endurance run trying to get from point A to point B. A solid story, but one that is presented in a hard-to-digest way.
The biggest problem with F.E.A.R. for me personally is the fact the entire game is so incredibly dull. I don't mean thematically or visually (in the terms of graphics, they're quite good for the time in fact), but instead that every environment is [i] painfully [/i] boring. Grey concrete corridor after grey concrete corridor. I found myself having to force myself from quitting the game due to every single level being such a slog, trudging through with great mechanics but let down by a completely bland backdrop. It's warehouse: the game. Things get a little better mid-game, but it's still a painfully boring experience and I found myself wanting more exposition rather than having to shoot more bad guys in the bland settings. This problem persisted until the last few chapters of the game, when things start ramping up, but it took so long to get there. The shooting mechanics are great, the story is good, but the environments and gameplay complexity are just non-existent. Soon the novelty of the shooting goes away, and you're just wishing you could progress faster through the waves of enemies, enjoying every small moment of exposition before it's back to shooting. It's a good, classic, solid singleplayer experience that I'd recommend; the good moments hit such a great cord, it still tends to drown out the bad."

I recommend playing on the highest difficulty, this way you can fully appreciate the AI, and it's still not unfairly hard.

Maybe few *yikes* but nothing that would stop me from playing it.

Even tough it have already aged quite much it's enemy Ai is still propably the best on the whole shooter-genre.

Ai communicates between each other, shoots the red barrels next to you and tries to throw frags sometimes.

Right, time to play Extraction Point and Perseus Mendate DLC's before moving to F.E.A.R 2.

76561198056406132,1535401091,True,"It's a Great classic game with a super phoned in ending that sucks and what I feel is tacked on horror walking simulator sections. However the tactical gameplay was extremely solid and holds up better than even some modern first person shooters. There is a good variety of weapons to use in the game but I do feel there is some strange omissions like a sniper rifle or a different shotgun. To many automatics in the game (although fun and effective).

The lighting in the game looks great while the textures and models are fairly basic for today's standards. The game runs smoothly on modern hardware after I added a fps fix to the config due to the game having issues with HID compliant devices. Overall I would say the Visuals are suitable for the game in 2005 and this game was used as a benchmark back in the day.

The gameplay like I mentioned before is a tactical FPS with the player having the ability to activate a slomo effect to gain the advantage in a tough spot. There are variety of different soldier enemies with different weapons, mechs, and ghosts as enemies. The first 9 intervals (chapters) in the game include both fps combat and walking simulator style horror sections to pad out the gameplay. These walking simulator sections in the in my opinion don't really add anything signficant to the game and really just serve as filler for the awesome combat sections. This leaves the game with vary little variety and repeativeness can set in really quickly (something that the horror sections try to alleviate but fail due to being unintresting). Overall the game is at it's finest when your in the thick of a shootout with a squad of soldiers trying to out gun and out manuever you. The game is at its worst in the last 3 intervals where instead of fighting soldiers you fight a bunch the same ghosts that pop out of black spots that show up randomly. The last 3 levels feel like complete and utter filler and do not live up to being a good finale for this game.

This was my first time playing through this game so I decided to play on the normal difficulty setting and I honestly ended up having full medkits throughout most of the game. If your like me and are moderatly good at FPS games I would recommend playing on the hard or hardest difficulty. The game is $10 W/ both expansions (I have yet to play them) and at that price even the base game is worth it. However I am pretty sure i got my copy on sale for like $2.50 a little while go and at a sale price it's a total steal. 

P.S. I saw some reviews saying they like the game but can't recommend it at $55. I think what is happening here is some people are buying the fear complete pack and think it only includes the orginal game and expansions. To be clear Fear complete pack includes all the Fear games and their dlcs including Fear, Fear 2, and Fear 3. If you just want the orginal and expansions all you need to do is buy the $10 option on the Fear store page and It will include fear and both expansions."

76561198059643219,1534918802,True,It might be an older game but it’s still incredibly fun to play. Good story and plenty of spooky bits to get you to jump a little in your chair. One of my personal favorite things about this game is the A.I. Isn’t as dull and boring as almost every FPS out there. With tactics and thinking of an actual enemy rather then some series of code popping its head up at the same place in front of my cross hairs. The first time I saw one of the baddies shove a shelf over to get to cover I thought it was the coolest thing I’ve seen in a long time (in a non-scripted environment way). Then I got murdered be well timed flanking more then once. 10/10 would get flanked again.

76561198122281014,1534790803,True,"An amazing and entriguing story where you play as an elite special forces unit who specializes in the paranormal. With atmospheric horror elements and what may be the best shooting mechanics I've ever seen, this is definitely worth picking up. The weapons are all unique, and enemy squads communicate with eachother to set up ambushes, traps, and flanks.

The same can be said for the expansions as well, with the exception of Extraction Point. Do not play it. You will spend more time trying to get the damn thing to work and stop crashing than you will actually playing the game."

The game also has an intriguing story with some genuinely creepy moments throughout, so horror fans will get a kick out of it as well.  Beyond the story, there's also a multiplayer mode, but it doesn't seem very active.  You can get the game from other sites for less than 5 dollars, and for that price, it's a must buy.  F.E.A.R. is one of the best shooters out there.

One of the best FPS' of all time with incredibly impressive AI that puts modern games to shame. You can reload a save from before a gunfight, do it again, and it'll always play out differently. Story takes a backseat to the gameplay and it's all the better for it. The gunplay is still some of the best you'll find in a game today.

Also I love stencil shadows.

76561197988600942,1533501250,True,"F.E.A.R.....A war is coming.


FEAR is a FPS with elements of Asian horror,fantastic enemy IA and some good Slow Mo for good measure.

The world is filled to the brim with details, like when you shoot at the walls a smoke will spur or when you hit metal surfaces spikes will appear and seeing all of that in slow mo, while trying to kill from behind cover is incredible.

Enemy IA is prety good, they communicate and depending on their numbers and possition they will flank you or swarm you. 

The sound of this game is excellent, footsteps,bullets dropping to the ground as well as the music just makes playing this game so much fun.
Voice acting is good, the music fits the game incredibly well.

We do get a good variaty of weapons to use, from pistols, smgs, assault rifles and a super fun,overpowered shotgun.
You can only carry 3 weapons at a time, but All I ended up using was the shotgun, the G2 assault rife and the stabbing gun on the highest difficulty, which by the way is not really that extremely hard.
One thing I do find weird is that with so much effort put into small details the reloading of the weapons is very weak, like N64 FPS weak... the reloading happens off screen and semi on-screen which just looks weird.

There really isn't much enemy variation, you got the 2 human types soldiers, some juggernaut, and 3 other enemies that appear twice during the game lenght which is around 8-12 hours depending on your skill and difficulty level.

REMINDER: Like condemmed criminal origins you need to download a documment and put it into the game file because otherwise your FPS will get a massive hit everywhere.

The story is good, nothing incredible but doable, just sad that our character has nothing...name is point man wtf....he never speaks so when we find survivors its all about giving them a communicator so they can talk to our boss..wtf ?

Other than that this game is fantastic, I loved every single minute of it, it was fun, the battles are fantastic the slow mo is so much fun, the sound is perfect, the graphics are good and has so much details altough the color scheme is a little bit on the bland side as well as the locations are not really that varied. The lenght of it I found to be perfect, there are collectibles like health increase and focus (slow mo ) increase as well as phone messages and computers.

Multiplayer is dead


All in all F.E.A.R gets an 9.5 out of 10


F.E.A.R makes it to my Top Games of All Time list.



F.E.A.R Extracion Point is the first expansion and follows up right after the ending of the base game.
It is more focused on combat and adds some fantastic scares and a few new weapons and enemies. 
Story wise it does nothing much ( since both expansions are NOT canon) But it had some great moments and events.
There is a lot more arena combat sequences than the base game and while the addition of the new weapons and turret mines are fun I barely used any of it except maybe the laser cutter.
We got a few new enemies but again they only appear twice or three times.

It is a fun expansion that lasts only 3-5 hours.

76561198079380961,1532841388,True,"F.E.A.R. is the best entry of the three games, for a few reasons but mostly because it was the most clear and mechanically solid of the three main entries excluding F.E.A.R.

For it's time, the dynamic lighting, physics and special effects were all very impressive, and I still get a kick out of melee'ing a can of paint around for a minute. 

The gunplay is still inventive and a handful of fun. There's a lot of dynamics like shooting a grenade in the air to time an explosion, or karate kicking an enemy through a window. Think of it as though Doom met The Ring with a little bit of Half-Life sprinkled into the mix. It's a great time, and some not so scary but still entertaining spooks to give it some kick.

76561197995776428,1532320661,True,"The games famously good AI is very overrated. Illusion of it being good comes from the fact enemies announce all the stuff theyre doing. They will also try to abuse possibilities of taking you from the back or by side, but once you learn their moving and command patterns it becomes fairly easy. It is still common here that they will consantly walk in into your rifle sight and camping in far end of corridor (where they cant possibly flush you out with grenade) will be most efficient and safest strat of killing everyone with minimal ammo and defense loses.

Yet, I hardly cannot recommend this game. It still plays great, weapon feeling is amazing, slowmo effect even today can look pretty nuts. Graphics aged... but your eyes shouldnt bleed out if you arent completely spoiled by todays video games. The games gameplay is its strongest suit, ""linear fps"" is pretty dead or not done with enough finesse like it used to be done.

And I'm not just only talking about the horror of a ghost haunting the player throughout the game.
I'm talking horror from fighting enemies as well.

Enemies in FEAR are not really innovative in terms of what they are. Most enemies you face are human clones holding guns, similiar to those you've kill in other FPS games.
But when fighting against enemies in FEAR, you are actually afraid of their actions.
From my experience, the closest comparison is enemies in Max Payne 3. In that game, enemies quickly react to your postion and actions. They will execute plans to put you under pressure and eventually put you down.
Enemies in FEAR can do those things, but on a different level.
Enemies can outright camp for you to walk carelessly into their lines of sight. Surprised enemies will run for cover or even jump out of a window if their positions seem exposed. Sometimes they can crawl through paths that the player cannot use in order to perform the flank and kill you. They can throw grenades at you then wait for you to move out of cover.  You can also trick the enemies by silently go around them while they focus on your last known position. Scared enemies can call for more reinforcements and will hold their grounds until help arrive. These things make enemies in FEAR so terrifying and also make every kill meaningful. There are also different enemy types with different weapons, forcing you to mix up your strategy and be more cautious while fighting.
-
I recommend playing this game on a difficulty that carelessness will get you killed. Not checking corners or missing more than a few shots should get you killed in FEAR. The challenging thrills is what seperate this game from other shooters. I completed this game on Hard mode (not the hardest).
-
The game compensates its complex and unforgiving enemy behaviors by giving the ability to slow down time for a limited time (Max Payne's bullet time)
However, this ability doesn't help you dodge bullets, so precise aiming and positioning are still required in every engagemnet in FEAR. Your character can also perform slide-kicks and jump-kicks as well, combine them with running and shooting can make for a very satisfying gameplay experience.
-
Every weapon in FEAR feel distinct and provide different benefits in combat. Pistols can be dual-wielded for spamming bullets. Fast-firing SMG can rip enemies from close to medium range. Slower-firing assault rifles can give sustainable damage at range. And the shotgun can outright delete the enemies standing in your path. There are also heavy weapons like experimental gauss rifle, grenade launcher, and nail-shooting rifle that you will find further into the game as well.
Gore also plays a big part in combat (I think you can disable it in the settings menu) Shooting a soldier point-blank can tear his legs, arms, or his enitire body apart, gunshot wounds leave big blood stains and pools, enemies scream in agony when they are shot to death, gruesome and satisfying at the same time.
-
The actual ""ghost"" horror in FEAR is well executed. It gives enough shivers to make the player nervous, but not distracting when combat section begins.
-
All and all, FEAR is a game that everybody who loves FPS shooting games, but also can bear some horror, has to play and finish at least once in a lifetime."

76561198143623907,1531651882,True,"F.E.A.R. is simply classics. Back in 2005, it was truly revolutionary with it's intelligent AI and graphics. Nowadays, the graphics suprisingly hold up. They are a bit dated, but the lighting and shaders are really great for such an old game. 

The gameplay of F.E.A.R. is quite hardcore. You can quickly kill normal enemies, but they can quickly kill you, too. You can however heal yourself using medkits at any time and you can carry 10 medkits at once. Trust me... you are gonna need them.
 You can also use melee attacks which are very effective and Point Man's special ability, enhanced reflexes. When you activate it, you go into slowmotion where everything is 5x slower but you are 2x faster than everything else. This way you can make fights easier since it takes enemies longer to react. You can extend the slowmotion time permanently by picking 
up reflex boosters.
Aside from the standard replica soldiers and ATC security, you are also gonna meet replica's heavy units (such as REV-6 or Powered Armor). They can soak up quite a lot of damage, but high powered (MOD-6 Rocket Launcher, Grenades, Mines...) and Armor Piercing (ASP Rifle, Penetrator HV...) are very effective against them.

In horror sequences, you are going to encounter Alma's apparitions aswell. Alma was a girl who was experimented on by ATC and wants her revenge. She sometimes causes you hallucinations, sends you into Almaverse or deploys her apparitions  against you.She rarely attacks you directly. Her apparitions appear as 3 types in FEAR and expansions: 
Nightmares - flying ghosts which ram into you and explode on impact, dealing damage
Shades - Transparent and very aggresive entities which behave similarly to Replica assassin enemies. Exclusive to expansions
Scarecrows - enemies which reside in black holes inside the ground and try to suck you inside and devour you if you step on their hole. Appear only in Perseus Mandate expansion pack.

The FEAR story takes place in year 2025 and focuses on Pointman, a new member of top secret unit F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) specialising on fighting supernatural threats. You are sent on a mission with the rest of your team to kill Paxton Fettel, Alma's son who is a telephatic commander of an unit of clone soldiers called ""Replica"" who went rogue. 

 Extraction Point expansion pack is great and as good as the original game. It is a direct sequel to the story of base game in which you have to fight through the Fairburn city to the extraction point where you are supposed to be extracted by an UH-60 Blackhawk. It features new weapons, enemies and about 5-7 hours of story. It also features bigger levels than the original game.

Perseus Mandate features about 4-10 hours of story where you play as Sergeant, a member of the second FEAR team. This expansion pack is not as good as the base game and Extraction point. It does feature new weapons (which mostly reuse the animations of standard weapons and have quite low quality models and textures) and a few new enemies. It is still worth playing.

FEAR is simply a great game which is worth playing.

76561198207066621,1531539145,True,"I had this game, back when CD's were the shit and steam wasn't even a thought in my mind.
I L O V E D everything about this game and it truly brought the horror genre to FPS's like no other. To give you all a general description of what you are about to (hopefully) purchase.

F.E.A.R is an horror FPS with a chilling tale behind it. You start off as Point-Man a fresh recruit in the operations of First Encounter Assault Recon. You are to investigate the activation of replica soldiers under the psychic commander Paxton Fettle, a test subject of the Armakam program under the guise of 'Origin'. You are plunged into a world of horror as you soon find out that a young girl, Alma, is somehow linked to Fettle and is seeking revenge on those who have wronged her. You will see ghosts, you will see alot of gore, you will feel at the edge of your seat as you check each and every corner for a new threat.

I cannot explain the DLCs Extraction Point and Persesus Mandate because they contain huge spoiliers but heres the gist of of Extraction Point - Hard af but still fun and soooo worth playing
and
Persesus Mandate - Fun as fuck and still very teriffying like the original game.

Buy this game if you haven't already, you are missing out if you do not purchase this game. Any negative commentors are just sappy, salty, sallies who are babies and do not like a little girl terrorizing them. 

BUY IT!"
76561198035677446,1531288841,True,"Holds up extremely well - although it does require one tiny tweek for Windows 10, the game never crashed and ran at full fps. The game itself is an amazing classic, and the best one out of the series. Highly recommended for anyone that enjoys a mix of FPS and Horror.

One thing to note, however, is the DLC. The game and its dlc needed a dinput8.dll. Extraction Point has a lot of issues with widscreen (mentioned on the forums), and I ran into issues with a stutter. The stutter seemed to be fixed by relaunching the game, or reloading a save. Most of the time it was coming from a load, and took a few seconds which was fine. Although there were two spots where it just didnt go away and caused some physics issues. Another issue was the no server issue near the end, which was resolved by changing to resolution back down, and I changed it back shortly after with no issues. Perseus runs like butter, and has the correct widescreen support automatically."
76561198010093355,1531238091,True,"NOTE: IT WON'T RUN WELL UNLESS YOU DOWNLOAD THE DINPUT8.DLL FIX.
Also the steam overlay doesn't work for some reason, rip screenshots.

Still a fresh game after all these years. 

Since it's expansion packs don't have their own store page anymore, i'll just review all three at once.

1.) F.E.A.R : Holds up very well even today, the level design, gunplay and mechanics remind me of Max Payne (also an amazing game). The story is told to you through voice mails, intel and side characters which means that the game barely has any cutscenes and you're always in action, pretty immersive.
This game does not hold your hand at all, sure the jumpscares get old real fast and franky this game wasn't effective at scaring me at all. Funny thing, Perseus Mandate managed to catch me off guard and boy I wasn't expecting that at all since it's the weakest game of all three,
Took me about 17 hours to complete it. 

2.)Extraction Point : The story isn't cannon at all but as an expansion, it lasts about 5-7 hours which is impressive.
Takes place immediately after FEAR 1.
It has a lot performance issues, especially after Interval 3 and stutters a lot till you reach interval 5 even after the fix.
Also has a problem with save file and loading issues so you'll have to be patient in order to complete it.

3.) Perseus Mandate : At this point I honestly got a little bored since you play as a different character that's basically Point Man 2.0 and drags on till 7 intervals (they take 30 mins to an hour to complete, depends on your playstyle) will last you about 4-10 hours. 
Thankfully I didnt have any issues with running this other than the common save file & loading errors which can be fixed by downloading an unlocked savegame online.

Overall this bundle is worth it and still holds up to this day.


7/10 for the lazy."
76561198257328152,1531009554,False,"This old franchise still holds a space in mine nostalgic games I played in my childhood.
(base game without dlcs)

As expected it's a very old game, with that typical linear story and basic mechanics.
It focus on the Reflex mode and choosing the right weapons, that's about all the mechanics you got, and you get plenty of medkits everywhere, so avoiding death is very easy.
The story ain't bad for the time it was made, since it introduces the concept and background story of the sequels made after, in matter fact i think it's the main reason to play this game.

The gameplay repeats itself a lot mid way into the game, either is combat or just walking to the next section.
It isn't very compatible with newer systems, for example the resolution 1920x1080 display very small subtitles, yet it didn't bother me anyways.

Basically, if you don't mind outdated graphics and gameplay, and you're either in for the franchise, story or just nostalgic reasons like myself, I would say go ahead and get it.

If you are new to this series, then i would advice to play this one just for the sake of the story, else if you don't really care about the story then I would advice to move on to more recent games of F.E.A.R. since this one is clearly outdated in almost every aspect.

I can see how back in the day, this game probably blew people's minds. Graphics, leaning, you can see your torso/feet, good lighting, enemy AI, etc. These things still all hold up years later, except of course for the graphics. They still aren't terrible, but the environments were really lackluster and mostly looked the same (to me). 

Nevertheless the blend of horror and action was well done. Just keep in mind this game has bad problems with running at 20 fps due to a logitech keyboard issue. Just google the problem and download the .dll from PC gaming wiki that makes the game run at a full 60+fps."

76561198021300125,1530846639,True,"very fun, straightforward little FPS with enjoyable combat, interesting environments and a length that knows when it's about to overstay its welcome that is slightly soured by it's unimpressive attempts at being a horror game. thankfully those moments are far and few between as you will spend most of the game shooting at armies of cloned soldiers with AI that's intelligent enough to carry the combat through the entire game without getting boring. 

the game has some very nice effects too, such as enemies reacting to being shot, the ability to blow limbs their limbs off or turn them into chunks and paste or vaporize them until all that remains is a skeleton. the explosions can have some impressive impact, as they may shake up the entire room, screwing with the lights and knocking everything over, and the grenades in general are fun to use because of the above and ALSO because they explode on impact with enemies, meaning you can time your explosions better than just throwing it randomly and waiting for it to explode. although you can do that too. i just really liked the grenades in this game.

i will say that the games ending sequence was disappointing though. felt like they remembered it was meant to be a horror game and through nothing but obligation threw some last minute Oh Scary Things in instead of letting the environments and situation speak for itself."

The AI is some of the smartest I have ever seen.  They will flank you, they will look for cover, and they will kill you successfully more than a few times.  
That being said, the gunplay is truly excellent.  Bullets have impact and accuracy.   Enemies and yourself can only take a small amount of damage so every firefight has consequences.  The lighting and physics effects were miles ahead of its time. Some of the effects I still havent seen to this day. 

The best part of the game is truly the story.  I mean this has obvious overtones of The Ring, but I have never had so many jump scares in my life.  Not that there are a lot of things jumping out at you, but the timing of those events is brilliant.  Step off a ladder and  you might be surprised who is waiting for you at the bottom.

76561198037417568,1530135168,True,"Despite the very simple geometry of the indoor spaces this game has, it looks fantastic and ahead of its time, even today. Crisp textures that look better than some of today's games' examples, shadows that are sharp and react from nearly every light source, volumetric lighting in an early-mid-2000's game, and an art style that is realistic, gritty and claustrophobic.

Punchy and bassy sound design, satisfying physics, excess gore and particles, a Matrix movie inspired bullet time system, pistols that make you feel like John Wick, meaningful weapon variety like nail guns that stick baddies to the wall and an electric weapon you get later on that strips the flesh right off them. All this to make the most satisfying and fun shooter experience I've never played.

The horror aspect is based on very effective scripted events and some present cue's to the games dark and creative story about scientific study and captivity I will not spoil further. The horror is supernatural in genre, Japanese inspired; be prepared to get scared of commercial real estate office settings like you never have before.

What impresses me also is how it works right out of the box, (unless you're using Logitech devices that tank your framerate which there are forums for a fix) this game was developed for PC's in mind first and seemingly futureproof. 4k resolution support, no framerate cap, excellent audio mixing for varying audio setups, works on Windows 10, and utilizes even the most modern of hardware properly.

This game is excellent, very polished and thoroughly built, an overall solid game that I wholly recommend."

+ the game's atmosphere is pretty creepy and has jump scares, flashbacks and spooky noises as you search around abandoned factories and research labs filled with robotic enemies and slaughtered civilians, fitting into it's horror theme
+ the enemies are very smart, acting and communicating together and as a team, using grenades to smoke you out, constantly flanking, throwing things over to create cover and so on
+ the weapons are pretty varied, you'll be searching around looking for ammo and new guns and getting things from pistols, various machine guns, to nail guns and laser weapons
+ theres also a slo-mo 'reflex time' and that's pretty fun and helpful to get the edge is sometimes difficult battles
+ the plot is pretty good, but I think it does end on a cliffhanger and is a little ambiguous

- aesthetically, most levels look pretty similar, but there are tons of different paths to take usually, and hidden weapons, audio tapes, phone messages and upgrades to be found, but the seeing the same/similar corridors can make the game tedious to get through

But as a shooter, this game makes you feel like an action hero, and it does that extremely well. It feels something akin to a John Woo movie, having very smooth, fast-paced movement and shooting, with the majority of the arsenal at your disposal all being particularly fun to use, from the basis USP to the nail gun, both inside and outside of the bullet time reflex ability.

The cherry on top is the great AI. Simple in design, but they will very easily take you out if you slip up or don't pay attention. They are very vocal and act human, fleeing to cover when attacked, responding to seeing your flashlight and reacting to teammates going down, making them fun and immersive to fight against.

It gives a lot of modern games a run for their money, which is probably ten times the budget of this game. Highly recommended."

76561198064872447,1528473577,True,"2006 Corporate Office Simulator:

This game is a classic reminder of what games used to be like prior to 2012. Packed with creative gameplay elements, challenging AI and and obvious attempts to squeeze the absolute maximum performance out of a graphics engine. This game made me genuinely nostalgic for a number of reasons and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a novel, sci fi-tinged shooter.

Now, I ramble. I really can't say enough how weirdly impressed I was with the attention to detail in this game. Replica troops react dynamically to where they've been shot and will actually try to crawl under obstacles while laying down covering fire to get to you and they will succed in killing you numerous times. The aforementioned corporate offices where you'll spend most of the game are bizarrely comfy and incredibly detailed. The computers have screensavers and there are posters all over of bogus defense projects photoshopped into being. I couldn't shake the feeling that it looked and felt real and that reinforced the strangeness of all the paranormal events taking place in the game. Sidenote: I found the horror elements to be more annoying than anything as they broke up the solid shooting and snooping sections with mostly cheap shock and awe."

Despite that it came out almost 13 years ago, it aged well, the graphics are good, the horror bits in the game are handled well with intense soundtrack that keeps the player nervous and anxious. You play as the 'Point Man' , your goal is to make your through the Delta Force's army goons and to eliminate Paxton Fettel. As the game progresses new types of enemies are introduced, the levels are getting more difficult, encouraging the player to make strategies before getting on 1v1 with a boss or a strong enemy. Overall it's a good horror title to play at night.

76561198092862237,1528277980,True,"F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon is a horror FPS developed by Monolith Productions and published by Vivendi Universal Games and Warner Bros. Games.

So, since this game also has 2 Expansion Packs, which you can't buy solo (on Steam, that is) I will do a review of all 3.
Call it ""F.E.A.R Vivendi Timeline Edition""

In F.E.A.R. we play as ""Point Man"", one of the members of a F.EA.R. they mission is to eliminate Paxton Fettel, a man who takes command of a battalion telepathically controlled clone supersoldiers and seize control on Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) headquarters.

Gameplay in F.E.A.R. focuses mostly on shooting enemies while doing objectives, and slowly progressing with a storyline.
For that, game features an interesting arsenal of weapons, mostly because more powerful weapons are clumsy and slow our manuvers and movement, so you have a choice of going with bigger guns that deal more damage, or with smaller ones that allow you to use battlefield as your advantage.
Everyone will find something for himself, but a small amount of that. Pistol, shotgun, smg, rifle...aresnal is simple, and with lack of difference you rather have to adapt to it and use what you find. 
Unless, you prefer ""Berserker"" style, as melee is really effective in a game. 
If you will holster your weapon to get maximum manuver and mobility, and do a little hand to hand combat that includes punches, kicks, and slides, you will find it really dangerous yet rewarding strategy of killing small groups of enemies if you lack ammunition.
Also, you can carry ""only"" 3 three weapons at once, so pick carefully.

Even more carefully, as enemies are not easy to beat. 
I mean, if the game allows you to carry 10 medkits at once, you know it means something.
F.EA.R. AI is known to be one of the greatest AI's in video games to date, and there is a certain reason to that.
Enemies can duck to travel in crawlspaces, climb ladders, jump through windows, vault over railings and create covers by pushing over large objectives, which allows them to often control a battlefield.
They also have a really, really great communication, and will act as a team, often using that to flank you, supress fire, take cover while under fire, flush you out from cover with grenades, and use different types of enemies to different purposes, such as using Heavy Armored guy to be a ""tank"" while rest will get better positions or will try to flank you.
That makes really intensive and great fights over various levels, and on higher difficulties, a real challenge.

To help you out, game features ""Reflex Time"".
Reflex Time slows down game world while allowing you to aim and react at normal speed. 
With often being screwed by amount of enemies, and their great combat skills (thanks to AI probably) you will use that, a lot. 
This is also used as showing that protagonist has ""superhuman reflexes"", part of a story you will find in game.

You can also upgrade your Health and Reflex Time lenght by collecting ""Reflex/Health boosters"". 
So a little bit of exploring is needed. But don't get lost, as game has really ""interesting"" level designs.
Mostly you will fight in buildings and tight spaces, but from time to time you will find yourself on a much more open area.

The main problem I have is, levels because of that can become...repetitive, as game uses a lot of same things over and over, same rooms, same places, same corridors...you will probably see that one time, so you probably want to get used to that. 
Well..this and maybe a really, really messy storyline, even more as game series features 2 different timelines! 
F.E.A.R. is a base to both of them, but F.E.A.R. Expansion Packs are making a ""Vivendi Timeline"". 
Thankfully, in that timeline there are only those 2 Packs that make it. Also, that timeline is not an offical one. Hopefully that will help you.

Bigger part of a good horror game lies in Atmosphere, without it game is just not a horror game.
F.E.A.R.'s horror theme is inspired by Japanese Horror movies, where horror part focues rather on psychological horror than on being ""spooky"" by monsters and jumpscares.
Same here, you won't have really many jumpscares, scary monsters, and such. 
Game will try to slowly get under your skin, by using flashbacks, subtle ""paranormal activity"" feeling over the place, and by giving you a lot of combat, to focus you on other things than horror aspect. 
But it will hit you in few moments, when you are not prepared.

Sound design is also a really, really important role in that.
Composed by Nathan Grigg audio, of course designed in the style of Japanese horror films, works really great and adds that horror feeling, by being unpredictable and often being stopped by silence. 
Not counting that, rest of the game, like gun sounds, tracks while in combat, menu theme, are also great.

Now, onto Expansion Packs!

First one is Extraction Point. 
You NEED to play it, not because it's great, but because it continues from ending of a base game, so if you want to know what happened, you have to play it. 
There is not really much to talk about as it is really similar to a main game.

You have 3 new weapons, and few new enemies. 
You can bash door with your melee, or by using explosives to blast them open, always something if you are bored of pressing action button.
Main change is in actual combat, firefights are much longer and feature more enemies than in main game, which also makes this expansion harder.
Also note that Extraction Point has higher system requirements than the original F.E.A.R.
Ending also in an ending to a ""Vivendi Timeline"".
Pretty sad, as ending sucks.

Perseus Mandate is a second expansion pack.
This pack follows the story of a new player character called F.E.A.R. Sergeant, a member of a secondary F.E.A.R. team sent in to investigate Armacham's Perseus Project.
Game takes place during the events of F.E.A.R as well as the Extraction Point expansion pack.

This pack includes new weapons and enemies found in the previous expansion pack, and to that it adds 3 new weapons and 5 new enemies.
Main changes are friendly A.I.-controlled characters who fight alongside you in few moments, and new faction of enemies.
Rest is the same, and I know many people were annoyed by that, mostly by lack of new environments.

Overall, F.E.A.R. is a nice game, with intense combat, amazing AI, interesting atmosphere and messy storyline that noone understands expect ""deadly girl trying to kill everyone"" part. Eh, those Japanese horrors.

8/10  He deserved to die. They all deserve to die.

76561198196756126,1528253337,True,"F.E.A.R. is a horror-action first person shooter game developed by Monolith Studios for the LithTech Jupiter EX Engine. You play as the unnamed Point Man, a character with no personality traits except for 'phenomonal reflexes', working for a government agency called the First Encounter Assault Recon, and going on a one-man mission to take down an insane lunatic with a mental link to millions of cybernetically enhanced clone soldiers. It only really gets weirder from there.

If you're more into horror than action than I would recommend you give F.E.A.R. a pass, but if action's your bag than getting through this campaign is almost required viewing for a traditional old-school gamer. The game takes its cues from Half-Life as well as various cinematic horror tropes to create a stylish and thrilling combat experience with enemy AI that still holds up to this day. In fact, the enemy AI probably knocks most modern AI out of the water. The guns are all varied and punchy and the slow-mo mechanic allows you to really enjoy the craftsmanship given to the enemy protocols as they make tiny decisions quickly.

From a story perspective, the game honestly leaves something to be desired. There's no shortage of audio logs or spooky little moments, but the game would benefit from some more Half-Life or Bioshock styled environmental storytelling as well as storytelling through gameplay, because unless you sit down and listen to these unanswered phone messages you won't be getting any information about the crisis at hand. Even then, if you do hunker down for all the various audiologs the actual backstory is pretty threadbare and doesn't justify its around 9-11 hour length. The game's ending is also pretty lackluster, with a few areas filled with a new enemy type that seems like its building up to some final encounter with the games ultimate antagonist, but then nothing really happens and the game just kinda of stops.

All that being said, the action and occasionally well executed presentation are more than enough for me to recommend this game."
76561197969379513,1528227130,False,"The problem with games like FEAR, CS and COD are that they quickly devolve into corner/edge camping head shot mode, which is boring.

This is because of the limitations of the weapons arsenal. You only have weapons that shoot bullets in a straight line, so if someone decides to just sit at a point and camp a door or corner, they will always have a massive advantage. You basically only have to know at which height someone's head will show up when they come around a corner and shoot there. The only option an attacker has is to use grenades, which is lame.

Quake, Tribes and Unreal had already fixed this problem with better maneuvering, longer TTK, armor which protects against instant kill headshots, a much greater diversity of weapons and items like the shield gun and teleport gun. If someone is constantly hiding and camping one corner, you can get rid of him by using flak (which ricochets off walls and then still does damage, like the shotgun in T:V), shooting rockets or grenades at the area around his position (and you don't have just 3 grenades, you have a grenade gun with dozens of grenades), using shock rifle combo's or doing something like a shield gun jump to get behind him. This makes much more interesting engagements that aren't just about aiming at someone's head from a static position. As a result these games are much faster and more dynamic and essentially more game-like, and at some point it seems like people stopped wanting gamelike games, they started wanting movielike games with lots of interludes, realistic graphics and themes like World War X or cops. 

It seems very immature to me, and a crutch for video game makers to keep targeting  the same crowd of players because it's success guaranteed (except it won't last). The video game bizniz is only about 50 years old and PC FPS games at best 30, the surface has barely been scratched, many more things are possible but if you just keep making COD's and BF's then you'll never get there."

I was happy to see it still holds up.

People will like or dislike the story but I feel it helps to give FEAR its uniqueness. And yes there are some small puzzles and parts with no enemies so if you expect a COD-like shooting in every room you'll be disappointed. If you let yourself be immersed into the story you will not regret it.

Pros

* The A.I. is still fantastic. The opposition feels like they are actively thinking up ways to eliminate you
* There is not a plethora of weapons in the game but they are really nicely balanced
* I like the story, the little jump-scares and the creepyness in the game

Cons

* Not really a Con but the Bullet Time gimmick worked better in Max Payne
* The two DLC packs are ok but not as good as the main story with linear paths and some overpowered enemies.
* The visuals and textures don't hold up that well. Especially the chapters that are in the outside are kinda bland"

It is not a very hard game and you feel like a supersoldier when you get the hang of it. Nothing new storywise, but it gets you going. Not really scary, but certainly creepy at some points. 

The DLCs are meh. They are not canon to the story.  ""Extraction Point"" is more or less a boring and shorter version of the main-game without a story. ""Perseus Mandate"" manages to at least be as good as the main-game most of the time. 

It is a little tricky recommending F.E.A.R considering it comes in a bundle with the sequel and the third game, with no chance of bying it by itself. I haven't played the other games yet. Even so, F.E.A.R. is a classic game that still has a lot to offer despite coming out in 2005. Goes without saying that you should buy it on sale."

TL;DR at bottom

All I say with this game is that it was fun. It had awesome gameplay and by my surprise did have its spooky moments that gave me goosebumps. The weapons were brilliant to use and felt kickass, it just unfortunately some of my favorite weapons were only avaliable to use close to the end of the game. The enemy AI must also not be underestimated, they actually want to kill you to get more ammo fot their kickass guns as well.

The visuals of the game are good, having a good amount of detail in the level, but the colour pallet was pretty boring. But the destruction in this game was awesome, bullet impacts felt meaty with how they destroyed the enviroments and sent spark flying everywhere. The levels environments are split into 3 parts, having shiping docks, apartment/office building and a [spoiler]facility[/spoiler]. This did make the game feel a little repetitive, but the level design did make up for that. Each was smartly designed, having multiple paths, allowing you to tackle combat situations in different ways.

Okay now the spooky stuff. The ambience of this game is definitely creepy, and some of the music did give me goosebumps even though nothing was happening. There was one (unintentional?) scare that made me jump and it wasn't even related to the supernatural themes in the game. When there was a scripted jump scare, it never scared and a lot of the times I did miss something that I was meant to to looking at.

The gameplay of this game is brilliant. You can slow down time, allowing to see bullets travel in the air, shoot grenades and rocket mid air and generally do stuff tacticoolly. [spoiler](I promise to not use that pun again)[/spoiler] You can do also ninja kicks, but a lot of the time it didn't turn out to be as cool as I thought because you canlt properly ninja kick through a window. Guns in this game are awesome. They vary from pistols, SMG, machine gun, shotgun, nail gun, liquidfier rail gun, rocket and some explosive weapon that I forgot the name of. Absolutely all weapons feel powerful and surprisingly useful.

This game is a blast to play, and you should give it a try, it does go on sale for $2.50. Also if you want to purchase this game individually, purchase it from Humble Bundle here: https://www.humblebundle.com/store/fear?hmb_source=search_bar

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
This is a kickass game, every weapon is good to use and feels powerful because of the destruction they cause in the levels. The game does look bland in places, but the level design is great allowing you to explore and tackle combat situations differently. There are spooky elements and the ambient music really sells that, giving me goosebumps when nothing is happening. Just get this game, it worth it and if you want to purchase it individually without buying the whole pack, get it here at Humble Bundle: https://www.humblebundle.com/store/fear?hmb_source=search_bar"

But you can't buy them separately anymore, so you have garbage like FEAR 3 jacking up the price. For as long as I can remember FEAR being on steam, it was only $10 for the base game and both of it's expansions. I HIGHLY reccomend this game, but pick it up somewhere else unless this gets sorted out."
76561198082052049,1527169540,True,"got this on sale at fanatical, the bundle for fear 1, 2 and 3 with the dlcs for $5.

for an older game it certainly is still very playable, might just need to remap some keys in the options as the way they have it laid out by default will feel a bit weird.

the AI in this game will try to kill you, and do a pretty damn good job at it. they will use cover, move between cover while shooting, throw grenades that will definitely annoy you because they hurt, and they'll definitely make you work to get past them.

some enemies are annoying, like the sentry turrets, the little flying drones, and the 'ghoul/spirit' things later on and they'll likely make you have to use your 'reflex' mechanic to beat them. One thing I dislike is that grenades detonate/explode on CONTACT with a person, whether enemies or you yourself. I've gotten killed by an on-contact grenade a few times and holy balls it doesn't feel good, might be nice to have had a slightly longer grenade fuse timer.

The game mixes a bit the fact that you kinda have to pay some attention because enemies might sometimes be around the corner in order to not have you try to shy away from paying too much attention to the settings/environment and spooks that come with the horror genre, mixing the supernatural little girl that doesn't want to leave you alone with the very-real human enemies that bleed and will make you bleed, trying to make the supernatural feel like it's more real in a way that I think mixes the two pretty well. 

I've had the first Fear game before and played it before, now just replaying it to get back into the feel and will play the epilogue dlc and the other two following games after this review.

thumbs up, a game that is still enjoyable even today IMO.

[edit]
finished the two DLC
extraction point was pretty nice, a continuation of what happens after that suspense ending in the first game. You continue off pretty much where you left off, except now it's out there... but you get a little help from a fairly unexpected source, one that honestly started to make me wonder just what exactly happened....and why. I think Extraction Point REALLY adds to the overall plot of the game, makes you really think a bit more about the underlying events from project origin and Alma and the little girl that seems to appear from time to time and the involvement of the main character and why he's not just killed like everyone else aside from the ""hes the main character of course he can't die"" plot armor.  It got me really curious and now I want to know more of the story.  There were plenty of spooky moments and some psychological mindfuckery as well as some new weapons and what seems to be a bit more love for the scoped rifle. oh, and Holiday had some balls of steel. F

now.. Perseum mandate adds a a bit more story as well, they refresh you on some of the things that armatech corp is fucking around with since technically this is happening about the same time that the base game is, both teams on site and discovering information about what's really going on, project perseus with the clone armies and psychic commander, project origin, the 'source', the 'synchronicity event' and all that stuff as well as happenings during the extraction point as you see the giant explosion take place and even go through the subway where the main char goes through with the plane crashed next to the entrance/exit. A few more weapons though not terribly amazing ones. the new scoped rifle has a red sight that turns everything red, which makes it harder to aim honestly, I used to use the enemy's red eyes from their suits to check for their heads in darker areas but this sight makes it worse, and the damage is about the same as the assault rifle, which makes the original scoped rifle still superior as it does double that damage per shot. the lightning gun is useless. grenade launcher is ok but holy crap i've had grenades bounce back in awkward ways. I do like that they added more instances of pistols laying around so you can do your double wield which has pretty good accuracy, controlled rapid single fire with manageable recoil, and pretty decent damage. the main issue I REALLY had with perseus mandate is some of the enemies are ASS.  The last boss, one of those fast-reflexes guys with a fucking repeater cannon and TONS of hp.. fucking chunking me for 100+ hp PER single shot... honestly fucking disgusting. The events where that weird floor enemy appears from a black puddle and drags you down? way too predictable, needs to be more discreet to get the REAL goosebumps from the player.
The turret grenades though, I think that was a pretty interesting addition, it certainly helped hold off areas where there were large enemy groups."
76561198387637341,1527050686,True,"Just beat this for the first time a few minutes ago ... Wow!   The story built up to a satisfying conclusion, the ending, in my opinion is one of the finest I've ever seen. 

1. The horror was done flawlessly, jump scares that were actually scary. I shook to the core a few times ... memorable. And the way the ending was done ... wow ... chilling!

2. AI. Wow. I actually felt like I was being hunted down and they were trying to KILL me. Haven't played a lot of FPSs, but this surpasses everything I've played.

3. Physics and particle effects - I wish I could've played this in 2005 and experienced it. The effects even now are impressive. Bullet-time done right. The way AI reacts to your bullets, the particle effects when shooting things, it's impressive stuff, even for 2018. And I finished Doom 2016 recently. I feel that's saying something.

4. The lighting oh the lighting. The use of light and shadows was expert. The flashlight was very realistic (annoying though the short battery life), and every room with the light/shadow effect was very convincing. Even in 2018.

All in all fantastic game, I can understand the hype. Being a huuuuge X-Files fan, I couldn't help but feel this game was partly inspired by it, the atmosphere and scifi / government story really kept me hooked. I rate games based on the time they were released: 10/10.  in 2018: ... 10/10  Highly recommended!"

This game and at least one of its two expansions are unexpected gems -- coming from someone who pretty much exclusively plays FPSs. I was very skeptical at first and almost gave up early on because it felt like I was playing the lead as a one-man-army in a cliche paranormal sci-fi/action '80s film involving tech corporations and clone soldiers. The horror elements and gameplay struck me initially as mostly cheesy and repetitive, respectively. 

But as the game progressed, things ramped up, got less cheesy, and less repetitive; it just kept getting better imo. The horror elements that I thought were cheap and cliche began to fit into a genuinely interesting, horrific, unfolding narrative with masterful execution and unsettling atmosphere. The pounding combat became super addictive, thanks to great AI and the player's slow-motion ability. (The AI is great, however, only when the enemies fight you in groups; on their own, they are rather dumb. Luckily, they are always in groups.) 

The ending of the original FEAR is also quite satisfying, as it goes on to tie up many of the mysterious loose ends it left throughout the story -- but this happens pretty much only in the last hours of the game. For the age of FEAR (2005), the graphics, atmosphere, and especially the interactive environmental physics are unmatched. To convey an idea of this: there are VERY few games I personally want to replay immediately upon finishing. Half-Life 2 and Deus Ex: Human Revolution were like that. And I can say that FEAR is like that too. 

Impressively enough, the first expansion -- FEAR: Extraction Point -- manages to be EVEN BETTER in most respects than the original (story, graphics, lighting, environment, combat, horror, atmosphere, lore, etc.).

The second expansion -- FEAR: Perseus Mandate -- is disappointing in contrast to the previous games in pretty much every respect. Felt like a FPS circa 2003. Very cheesy stuff. But in its own right, it's still worth playing and contributes to FEAR lore."

76561197991826374,1524450983,True,"It's no joke--F.E.A.R. definitely has the best AI of shooter games, even up to now. It actually feels at times like the enemies are really trying to kill you. In most games, they seem more interested in cowering and waiting for you to kill them. F.E.A.R. enemies will flank you, charge you, and ambush you. Lots of fun.

The original F.E.A.R. is MUCH better than F.E.A.R. 2, which drops nearly everything that made the original great. F.E.A.R. Extraction Point is possibly even more fun than the original, because it has a lot more combat, more guns, and less pointless walking and secret-hunting. I can't yet speak about Perseus Mandate or F.E.A.R. 3.--still working on those."

The enemy AI is, as others have mentioned, better than the AI in many modern games of this type.  The atmosphere for the original game and for the Extraction Point DLC are just phenomenal.  Extraction Point especially had some wonderfully scary and freaky moments.  The Perseus Mabdate DLC, while solid, pales in comparison to the its previous releases and is really for the hardcore F.E.A.R, fan only.

76561197999574061,1523560843,True,"Can't believe this game is only available in a bundle. I got it completely by accident. I bought a Sims Collection box at a thrift store, and F.E.A.R. was buried under the other discs (probably a kid hiding it from their parents). Played it cold, and lost my mind. I can't pinpoint why I love these games so much, but here's some reasons:
1. FPS
2. ""BULLET TIME""
3. Great story
4. it's just that damn good.

If you aren't rich, wait for a sale, or track down a physical disc (yes, this was on a cd... if you don't like physical media, don't talk to me). You will not be disappointed. Unless, that is, you are a spoiled ""millennial"" flat-earther moron. If you are, you are probably likely to shoot up your school because somebody tagged you in an instagram photo that showed your zits. It's okay, we understand that your only education was by underpaid pedophiles that only got into teaching to get into you. Blame your parents, because the greed of their generation, and persistent overbreeding has initiated the downfall of humanity, and they deserve your scorn.
Enjoy!"

It's lots of little things. The story is convoluted and put across poorly - the backstory looks interesting on the wiki but you'd never get that in game. The combat is formulaic, once you've seen how the AI behaves. The levels are unmemorable, repetitive and linear and the scare-combat-scare format becomes predictable. Movement isn't great and combat music is often used which removes any suspense (that enemy you just killed was the last one). Also random physics objects like trash on the ground are ridiculously noisy when you walk into them."
76561198057988972,1523504944,True,"Fantastic game, good story that takes ideas from J-Horror movies like the Ring, fantastic creepy sounds, plenty of good mind fucks and creepy moments, and constant suspense.

People praise the AI for being so good but it really isn't that advanced, it can be very easily exploited and mostly all of the spice is just enemies screaming what theyre gonna do or do basic reactions to your actions / environment. The horror part of the game was good and wasn't obnoxious in its attempts to SPOOK YOU WHILE SHOOTING BAD MEN....... The game scales very well with modern hardware with the exception of a logitech peripheral bug and I had to do no fixes to get the game working properly. I reccommend you just pirate this game if you really want to play it but if it's on a sale go for it by all means."
76561198053790296,1523391037,False,"While it holds up for a game of it's time, it's not necessarily something I would immediately suggest to somebody just getting into first person shooters. Solid controls, intelligent AI and a handful of well done horror sequences are ultimately held down by repetitive level design, a convoluted story and a lack in feeling of player progress. 

Check it out if you're curious, but if you're on the fence your money might be better spent elsewhere.

[list]
    [*]Slow motion shooter with cool effects 
    [*]Great AI that rivals a lot of the mediocre trash nowadays

[/list]
[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]
[list]
    [*]This is the first time every playing FEAR 1, I’ve played the others way back when they came out. Don’t remember the second one much, third one was lame. After hearing how this game is still good today I wanted to try it out. I think people need to take off their rose tinted glasses on this game

    [*]The story and horror aspect is so trash I it almost ruins the game. Most stories you can skip or at least push the story forward even if garbage. Here you have Alma the naked chick and the “main villain” that basically just walk across the screen as “jump scares”. The other side of the horror is just blood on walls and nothing that actually scared me. I do like physiological horror more and less cliché gore horror. You get visions that are smeared vaseline and foggy that you walk slowly through and sometimes kill floating enemies. The whole story and horror aspect is so bad it should just be ripped out and changed.

    [*]The combat is fun with the little there is in the game. If you play this once, which most will. There are only a few levels that were good. 12 levels with 7 of them having little or no combat, just walking opening doors, climbing ladders and getting jumps cares. The rest are fantastic and wish more of them existed. You have the standard weapons with a railgun, and a spike gun that were my two favorites. You don’t aim down sight which is fine as most engagements are not long ranged.

    [*]The praise this game gets is from the AI. For its time I can see the how far ahead it was. The AI is still better than most AAA games now. There aren’t a lot of games that give players this feedback and playability that comes with good enemies that react more immersive. They will jump vault over objects to avoid grenades, use nades to flush you out while another is flanking. This game is not a cover shooter for you or the enemies. The fluidity of combat with is great.

    [*]With combat I have a few complaints besides not having enough of it. The enemy variety is lacking with 90% of enemies being grunts with either shotgun or machine gun. You do get 2 mech fights which are great and you can explode their rockets midair, epic. You get less than a dozen in the whole game of a cloaked melee enemy and armored dude with special weapons. I wish more variety of enemies maybe some projectile enemies paired with slowmo to emphasize that feature.

    [*]The only other reason to play this game is the slowmo. It feels at time needed as the game is hard. You don’t take a lot of hits on normal difficulty and without slowmo you would play this like a cover shooter. Luckily you get a good amount of slowmo to use before you need to let it fill up overtime. You can shootout grenades and rockets midair. You do have an advantage when in slowmo, I think the enemies miss you more and you have slightly faster movement so use it whenever you can. 

    [*]Overall the game is not a must play as people will tell you. The game is super short with frontloaded walking simulator and then ends over so fast right when the game starts to get good. With more variety in enemies that could offer longer playtime would make the game better. As with the story and horror for me deter from what the game needed to focus more on, emergent gameplay with an emphasis on slowmo. Replayability is also low for the lackluster variety that won’t last beyond replaying the few great missions and no good modding scene. That said the engagements I had were fun and I just want more as 2 hours of real gameplay hardly does anything for me.

I hadn't played this game in a fairly long time when I started again recently. The first thing I noticed was the graphics look like a combination of Half Life and Condemned. You would think that might be a good thing but actually it's not. There isn't much variety and it's very bland. 

The main reason I recommend it though is because it's still a fairly scary game with half-way decent gameplay. The guns feel a little off (certainly not as tight as Fear 2) but they do feel powerful enough to get the job done. If you have any sort of nostalgia for the series and have only played it on consoles, I do give it a recommend. If you've never played it and don't care that you'll miss some of the story - I'd skip it and just move on to FEAR 2. It's easily the best and most polished game in the series."
76561198020401289,1521834207,True,"First Encounter Assault Recon (F.E.A.R.) is a fantastic FPS experience with challenging AI and fast paced action. The story revolves around a mysterious project at a top secret research facility where strange occurrences happen all around the main character as he and his team uncover what is going on. There are great horror elements and some flippin' awesome jump scares that will make you shit your pants, guaranteed. No other FPS game has AI that is as challenging and dynamic - FPS games should use F.E.A.R. as their base line for good AI.

That being said, there are some draw backs to F.E.A.R. It's age is made apparent in the player movement - it is rather clunky and it can be difficult to naviagte some parts of the levels due to this. Additionally, some of the end-game level design does not synthesize well on the harder difficulties; the enemies you encounter can sometimes be vastly different in difficulty due to things like available cover, position manipulation strats, and the amount of ammo you have. 

Despite the negatives, F.E.A.R. feels like a groundbreaking FPS game with amazing gunfights, challenging AI, a pretty solid and creepy story, and some bonafied PogChamp moments.

Replica soldier"
76561198017483678,1521039829,True,"In my honest opinion, F.E.A.R 1 is the best of the series. It's expansions and sequels only tainted the reputation of the once legendary game.

The gameplay is something that anybody who loves first person shooters can enjoy. You have the ability to slow down time and react to danger immediately. Now wouldn't that be too easy you ask? It depends, but not having the ability to aim down sights, and instead zoom is one factor that balances the game. 

Some games struggle to make tools like trip mines, remote bombs useful. Not this, you WILL find a way to use them effectively in this game. Grenades in this game are so juicy, you swear they toned down grenades in every single game after this. They cause shockwaves, blow away things in the room, and it causes dust to pile up around the area. The guns are varied and feel great to shoot. 

Leaning is a small part of the game, but its inclusion is something you'll come to appreciate. 
Melee combat is a nice touch as you can do drop kicks, slide kicks, roundhouse kicks. Of course all of them deal about the same damage, but it's definitely a welcomed mechanic.

And, not to forget the best part of the game, the enemies. I won't say that their AI is the best AI ever, but I can tell you this- they are fun to fight. They don't take cover infinitely, they come out to rush you and flank you. When they throw grenades, they do it to get you out of cover. In addition, there are a lot of enemy types in this game, I won't spoil some of them but honestly more games need this kind of enemy variety.

I'm not a expert level designer, but god damn something about these levels feel fun to have a fire fight in. In the Extraction Point expansion for the game, something felt off about those levels. They don't feel as fun or rewarding to fight enemies in, and many times I could see the A.I just standing there. 

I do not recommend the expansions for the game, nor do I approve them removing F.E.A.R 1 from the steam store and bundling it to the inferior sequels. But I can safely say, F.E.A.R 1 is my favourite FPS of all time for it's amazing gunplay, level design, mechanics, enemies and lastly a bit of horror mixed in. There are no obonoxious jump scares in this game, if you were wondering. Sure, it might spook you, but it's not with loud screeches.

76561197961766636,1520924310,True,"F.E.A.R. has better-than-average FPS AI. There are a lot of moments of tension when you're in combat, because the enemies will do their best to flank or trick you. It can be a bit of a trip when the AI does something smart. The slowdown power you have opens up a lot of cool options in combat, and doing a dropkick on an unsuspecting enemy is always entertaining.

I don't think F.E.A.R. has aged too well otherwise, though. It's a lot of fun, it runs really well, and the port isn't too janky, but if you haven't played the game before it might be a bit tough to enjoy. Other FPS games have much better campaigns. Once you get over doing the Matrix bullet-time thing, the repetitive environments, and ""scary"" moments that look cheesy due to outdated graphics, well... yeah. It might not be for you.

I will say, though, I enjoyed my replay of it, the game was snappy in 144hz, and I didn't really have any performance hitches. Revistiing it for nostalgia was awesome, for me.

76561197972310600,1520702639,True,"FEAR is a fantastic FPS.  First and foremost, enemy AI is truly great.  They absolutely nailed that part, which makes such a huge difference.  There is also a ""bullet time"" (aka, slow-mo) feature, which will be an absolute must for surviving many-on-one firefights against AI opponents who act as intelligently as they do in this game.

The game world is also great.  Environments that have you constantly on alert for the unexpected, and settings that are often unsettlingly creepy.  The game, for the most part, is not truly ""scary"" I wouldn't say, but you are usually on edge.  It seems that they started out trying to make the game scary, the first 5-10 minutes prepare you for a really scary game, but after that, it's mostly surprise scares and the focus seems to be on great FPS play.  It's a good tradeoff if it had to go one way or the other.

Thinking about the mechanics of being an FPS, apart from the storyline (which is solid enough), it's a standout.  Guns are varied, satisfying, and have notable strengths and weaknesses that the game rewards very well.  Slow-mo is incorporated excellently.  Enemy AI has not been surpassed by any other game that I've played.  Level designs are varied and interesting.  I think this is one of the best FPS games that's been made. 9/10"

76561198101845723,1520398815,True,"FEAR 1 and its expansions are an absolutely great time. You'll find fun and challenging combat with a nice touch of flare from all the particle effects that you don't see these days. Arenas are fairly basic in terms of looks, but serve the gameplay excellently. They give both the player and the ai plenty of cover and flanking routes. 

Its is worth noting that you'll have to do some config tweeking for Extraction point to get it to run in 1920 x 1080 and some sections in both extraction point and perseus mandate (more extreme in the former) experience frame rate drops. To fix these, do a hard save and exit the game. Reload the save and you should be good to go. 

Many people dislike Perseus Mandate, and I can't really understand why. The environments do look blander than normal, but beyond that the gameplay is just as good as extraction point and the base game. But beware the boss battles versus ninjas with guns. Those are very tedious. But the rest of the expansion is well worth playing in my opinion. 

Also play Fear 1 and its expansions on extreme difficulty always. You'll get the most out of the experience like that. 

Now, Fear 2, is awful in my opinion. I played it on console back in the day and remembered hating it. Played through it again all these years later and I still hated it. Everything from the environments to the story has been improved, except for the moment to moment gameplay. Its a major regression. It went from a flashy shooter that encouraged movement via slow-mo, to a stop and pop shooter where slow mo isn't utilized to break cover but rather to easily shoot enemies when they break cover (which they do often). You are encouraged to find an effective spot of cover, stay there, and pick off enemies ass they try to close the distance. It is ungodly boring and frustrating on harder difficulties where enemies become incredibly accurate (even when you are in slow mo). Particle effects have been turned down significantly to support more detailed environments in general. The shotgun is no longer fun to use and you spend a good majority of the game fighting weak mercanaries instead of replicant soldiers. They die too quickly for combat to be interesting. 

Its just isn't fun to play at all. If you want a contination of the story then play it, but otherwise, don't bother with fear 2 or 3. They're not worth your time."

F.E.A.R is a game that reminds me of highschool, it was one of the best shooters of his time and had one of the best A.I. ever made, better than a lot of A.I. in modern day shooters. F.E.A.R or First Encounter Assault Recon tells the story of a special ops soldier that investigates a incident in an industrial complex owned by Armachan Industries. The story revolves around Paxton Fettel, an Armacham experimental telepath commander that has gone rogue and controls an army of clones called Replica soldiers. The second main antagonist seems to be Alma, a young girl that appears throught the game in some horror sequences. 

The main character, has no name, except being called Point Man by his colleagues, no background story and it seems to be mute, because he never speaks throught the entire game. The story is not fully explained through the missions and a lot of key elements are hidden inside Laptops or Phone messages that you'll need to uncover. The begining really requires a prequel, while the ending definetely announces a sequel. 

The A.I. is good, it seems to be quite defensive, because it doesn't always chase you, the best part is that it's not scripted and the same encounter can happen in a lot of different ways. The enemy variety is quite limited, the most unique units being the invisible Replica combat soldiers and the flying drones. The weapons are mostly standard relooked assault rifles, rocket launchers, shotgun, pistol, with the exception of the particle canon which is quite unique and fun to play.

The Extreme Difficulty increases the accuracy and damage of all enemies by a lot, but luckly the manual quick saves at any moment, remove any frustration that you might have with games that use only autosaves and force you to replay entire areas again. The Slow Motion or Bullet Time makes the combat quite easy and you can basically storm your way through enemies. The overall downside being repetition, you basically do the same encounters again and again for 8 to 10 hours story length.

The Graphics look nice, especially the particle physics, which are just fenomenal ! But overall the game lacks environmental diversity, everything happens at night, inside office buildings, or warehouses, there is a small chapter inside an abandonned appartment building, but that's it. I really hope that Monolith will bring more diversity in the sequel. Music and soundtrack are fantastic, they are not repetitive and contribute a lot to the atmosphere.

The horror element is awesome, especially for a 2005 game, and when combined with excellent sound and Alma's sudden apparitions, it really gives you chills through your spine. The strange thing about Alma is that you never really know if she wants you dead or if she wants to help. And by the end of the game, you still don't understand who you really are and why all this happened. There's a lot more to say, but I don't want to spoil anything.

Overall F.E.A.R is a masterpiece FPS with a great AI and interesting story . 100% Recommend

F.E.A.R Extraction Point
Story: 6.5 Graphics: 9 Gameplay: 9.5 Overall: 8.3 out of 10
First playthrough: Extreme Difficulty  100% completion 100% collectibles

Extract Point dates back to the era where expansion/DLC offered a real value for your money. For me a good expansion is one that provides the player with new story elements and an improvement to the original gameplay, extra features are a bonus.

F.E.A.R Extraction Point does bring some gameplay improvement, new weapons, enemies and of course - horror scenes, but I think it's major flaw is the way the story is presented. At first it seems a classic approach, similar to the orginal game, where you are coordinated by a SFOD-D Tech Officer and you need to regroup with your colleagues: Holiday & Jin Sun-Kwon, there are even some teamwork introduced. Now the problem is that you find yourself alone fast, with no one on your comm to provide any information whatsoever, except the mission description during chapters. Paxton Fettel is present again, but his appearances don't make too much sense, the same can be said about Alma. On top of this, there is no more Intel to be found and the phone messages don't provide any interesting information. 

The graphics & music are the same, but that's not really a bad thing, since they were great in the first game. The level design has again offices, warehouses and of course the everlasting night. The ony improvement is that some areas are larger, making the use of long range weapons more frequently - like the ASP rifle. 

Gameplay was slightly improved, at least from my point of view, by adding two new weapons  - laser carabine & machine gun, three if you count the portable turret, three new enemies - a ultra heavy armor Replica soldier, invisible demons and some re-skined improved combat robot. 

Extreme difficulty seems more buffed than the original game, which means you die a lot faster, so you need to use cover more often.

Overall, Extraction Point is a good expansion, in terms of gameplay, but creates even more confusion due to the bizzare story. I definetly recomment it to anyone that liked the original game!

F.E.A.R Perseus Mandate
Story: 7 Graphics: 8 Gameplay: 8 Overall: 7.6 out of 10
First playthrough: Extreme Difficulty 100% completion 100% collectibles

Perseus Mandate DLC tells the alternate story of a second F.E.A.R team that happens in parallel with the main story from game + Extraction Point DLC. You play a new character called ""Sergeant"" that has the same abilities like the previous character ""Point Man"", the story is not very polished and manages to bring out more questions than answers. New enemies are introduced - Nightcrawlers -  which are divided in two categories: normal soldiers similar to Replica and some super elite soldiers that have slow motion abilities. You don't really understand who they are or who created them, not even at the end of the game. Again there is some teamwork with your new partners: Captain David Raynes & Lt. Steve Chen, but the scenes don't last long, so you end up playing most of the game by yourself. The horror atmosphere brings into play some jump-scares that can be easily missed if you are not an explorer, the best part being the abandonned building where you are accompanied by one of your teamates.

I decreased the score of the gameplay due to the unrealistic health that was put into the super elite Nightcrawlers -- I mean you basically shoot multiple chargers into their head until they fall down. This can be OK if we are talking about some robots, but those are supposed to be human soldiers just like you, the lack of realism takes the fun part out. I don't even want to talk about their boss which can withstand multiple grenades sticked to his head and still kill you in one shoot. Overall, it's still the same gameplay as previous games, with the addition of three new weapons - an advanced rifle with a nightvision scope, a grenade launcher, and a lightning gun - showing that the developpers didn't bother to bring any major improvement.

The Graphics look actually worse than the previous games, the textures aren't polished and the dynamic lighting has basically been removed completly. The level design has no real improvement: same similar offices, labs, abandonned buildings etc. and no daylight. The whole story is quite long - especially on Extreme Difficulty - around 8-10 hours for full exploration.
PS: At the end of the game you unlock 3 new missions that are not related to the main story, with no saves available.

Overall Perseus Mandate is a nice addition for F.E.A.R fans, who waited almost a full year to fight new enemies, try new weapons etc. but everything seems rushed, unpolished, unbalanced. 
I recommend this game only for F.E.A.R. fans and only during sale !"
76561198017059981,1519955834,True,"F.E.A.R is a great action game. Slo-mo combat, smooth controls, smart A.I, a little bit of horror, and some good level design really make this game one of my favorites. 

My only problem with the game is the resolution options, as this game doesn't play well with 16:9 and up resolutions. The HUD and subtitles don't scale, so they will appear very small. There are some fixes that help performance issues, should you have any.

Warner Bros. decided to only include F.E.A.R in a bundle for a very high price point, which includes all of the F.E.A.R games. If you are intrested in only this game and not the others, just go get the [url=https://www.gog.com/game/fear_platinum]GOG[/url] version."

Not to mention that the Reborn DLC for F.E.A.R. 2 is locked behind the bundle, and it has mixed reviews. It's a £35 four level DLC for a game with mixed reception, it's completely ridiculous and it would cost less for me to buy the individual games than if I bought the bundle: £22.98 vs £35.96.

The slow-mo mechanic turned me into shotgun monster appearing out of nowhere and blowing enemies into fine red mist. And quicksaving all the time together with slow-mo allows for really cool cinematic encounters that you are prepared for. Level design is really interesting and exploration is rewarded with permanent boosts. Also AI seems to be really, really cool. Enemies interact with each otehr, react to your flashlight and make tactical decisions.

P.S. Sequels not recommended."

Every gun fight is action packed, destructive and chaotic. Every encounter is memorable and on the hardest difficulty setting this game can really put the player to the test. The gunplay and the way the A.I behave is something that all fans of fps games should experience.

Sadly the game is now only bundled in a ridiculously priced ""F.E.A.R Collection"" and cannot be purchased seperately at the moment. I recommend downloading or obtaining the retail version or waiting for the bundle to go on sale on steam."

76561198019815575,1518211312,True,"This game is a masterpiece and holds up tremendously despite its age so don't let that old release date fool you.

The A.I. in this game is one of the best, if not the best that I've ever seen. You actually feel as if you are fighting an intelligent being instead of a robot with basic instructions. Their goal in this game is not to kill you, but to eliminate a threat.  They will actively try to kill you, yes, but they act like a human would. They'll push you if you stay in a room, they'll throw grenades to flush you out of cover, they'll flank if the arena you're in allows it and the list goes on. A major difference between A.I. in other games and the A.I. in F.E.A.R is that in this game they actually have a fear of death. If you fire and miss a shot, they aren't going to sit in the same spot and turn and fire as accurately as possible at your head, they're going prioritize their own life over killing you and run to get out of your sight as quickly as possible and engage you behind cover. They audibly communicate with each other in order to give a sense of immersion such as making call outs like where you are or saying they need back up. After experiencing the A.I. in this game, it makes you realize how far backwards developers have gone with A.I. in other games since this was released.

The gunfights in this game are amazing. If you ever wanted to feel like a legitimate badass, then look no further. There's a lot of blood and gore and you'll see the results of it splattered all over the walls. Weapons such as the shotgun will turn your enemy into a red mist with a pin point shotgun blast if they're unlucky. Dust and sparks will fly all over the screen as if the room you're in had just exploded. Now onto how the game handles actual explosions; grenades will pulverize all the objects in a room as well as create an earth shattering sound and shake your screen, cause glass to rain down on you, and cause paper to fly around the screen. They'll also blow you into a restart and turn your enemies into paste.

The lighting is legendary. You can know where an enemy is and his exact location before you even enter a room just based off his shadow. It's at times intentional, but you can use it dynamically to help you. Also, the flashlight in this game is short but it also alerts A.I. so before you go into battle, you might want to turn it off. Unalert enemies take more damage than alert ones.

For horror, the aspect does feel a bit outdated. The creepy little girl theme has been around for years and is tiredsome to see, but don't let that deter you, the game did manage to get me quite a few times. Jumpscares are frequent in the game and the amazing soundtrack the developers used does an amazing job in adding to the spooky atmosphere of the game and keeps you on the edge of your seat through the whole game.

This next part kind of goes off the gun battles, but the combat is one of the aspects for what this game is most remembered for. You have a slow-mo ability called Reflex Mode which allows you to slow down time and you can also perform an array of melee attacks such as the bicycle kick, slide kick, and roundhouse kick. There's nothing better than melting an enemy in Reflex Mode with your machine gun and then roundhouse kicking one in the face afterwards.

The level design is decent. It's kind of weak in the first couple of levels, but it does get much better as the game goes on. The close quarters combat that the arena's have allows the A.I. to shine and that's what helps make them so great in the first place.

There is one issue though that I have to address. This game for some reason hates Logitech products and causes the game to run horribly. However, there is a fix for it that you can find by searching on the internet.

Overall, I can highly recommend this game. If you have any love for the FPS genre or action games in general and you don't own F.E.A.R, buy it. However, thanks to Warner Brothers, they jacked the price up for the F.E.A.R Collection to $50 for some reason. That's such an odd decision to increase the price for a 13 year old game. Buy it on sale, or buy it from Fanatical who has it for $5."
76561198014190840,1518125364,False,"The A.I. definitely holds up. Everything else, not so much.

Pros: 
- The A.I. puts even most modern games to shame. This makes the shootouts very engaging and tactical.
- The destruction physics, while dated, still create an impressive spectacle of dust, sparks and particles when shootouts escalate. 
- The gore effects are very punchy and satisfying, making the weapons feel powerful.
- The slo-mo power, despite nowadays having been done to death, is a satisfying and fun tool to use, and fits well with the tacticality of combat

Cons:
- Flat, bland, boxy, uninspired, dull and uninteresting environments all the way through. It says something that a parking garage is a breath of fresh air in terms of places to fight things in. 
- Inredibly repetitive gameplay: shootout, find thing to get past thing, creepy ambience, shootout, find thing to get past thing etc. The only break from this routine is an occasional sliver of exploration to find health and slo-mo upgrades.
- Lack of variety: there's only a few weapons in addition to three grenade types (one of which is next to useless), two of which you'll find ammo for so rarely they hardly matter anyway. The enemies stay essentially the same all the time with a couple of tougher minibosses you'll encounter from time to time.
- Dated mechanics: for example, despite this being a tactical shooter, aim is toggle-only. Since it's only a minor zoom-in and not an iron sights view, it can often be hard to discern whether you're zoomed in or not, which is a problem since being zoomed in affects your movement speed. No sprint function makes the movement feel sluggish in comparison to more modern shooters. Guns fire in bursts even if you only click the mouse button, and weapon recoil is very erratic. 
- The horror aspect is dated, and the horror and combat sections are completely separate from one another. It's also predictable (being often identified ahead of time with a signal of unknown origin), and relies in many places on cheap jump scares.
- The story is unengaging and relies mostly on voiceover instead of being woven into gameplay.
- The campaign is criminally short, clocking at under 7 hours on normal difficulty. 

Not recommended at full price. But definitely worth it if you spot it for $2.99 on a Steam sale."
76561197994103713,1518025262,False,"I have never in any game, crawled through as many airducts as in FEAR. being that I am playing this game over 10 years after it was released. It's a bit dated but entirely playable. I could have used more cut screnes to keep me motivated. I began loosing interest as all the levels were the same. RUN THE MAZE! It geels a bit like RINGU/Silent Hill. Another ghost with long black hair that covers her face. Oh the horror."
76561197978683845,1518002421,True,"FEAR 1 is a fantastic shooter with great gunplay and AI that really does seem to outstrip most other games even today, nevermind when it was new. Enemies will flank, flush you out with grenades, lay down suppressing fire and send out someone to attack. Meanwhile all the gunfire is kicking up dust, sending particles of the enviornment everywhere, even blowing potholes into the walls, nevermind the damage guns do to enemies, removing heads or pulverizing them into a fine red mist. 

The AI is more confident when their numbers are greater and will actively run for their life to try an ambush you if their number are real low. Even ignoring orders from their remaining numbers.

All this blends to make some wildly fun combat. The horror in the game ...it's hit or miss depending on who you ask. I think it's fairly creepy, the static noise you hear when something paranormal goes on still makes me uneasy. Trouble is, some of the jumpscares either fall flat or since they don't pull the camera toward them (as they happen in game) you can entirely miss them. Sometimes this does work as I actually noticed one of them in a review that they draw NO attention to in the game and it was pretty creepy. 
 
I'm not sure it's super important as the story is ...it's like DOOM, it's there but you only need to know the bare basics to know what's what. Gameplay is key here and it's pretty dang good. 

Flaws would be the enviornments are fiarly basic looking by today's standards, it's mostly in buildings or around them and rarely does the scenery change up. What you DO to the scenery is more important here. 
The expansions to the game are fun to play and have some really memorable moments where you're like ""Wait, how'd they do that?"" the story is eh here too but you get to do some fun things.

FEAR 2 is pretty good, but it certainly falls back in some areas. It looks better, it has some pretty crazy moments involving a small mech and shredding through baddies but, the AI isn't as impressive. I think the horror is a bit better done but it's also more in your face. Even going so far as to do the creepy school gag on you. There's more varied enviornments though and it's still pretty tough like FEAR 1. Worth playing!

FEAR 3 is awful. It's so very paired back and generic (as Point man, the alternate character makes it more interesting but the game still suffers). It wasn't scary, not even a little creepy and it really seems to be geared toward co-op where it was more fun ..sure, but when we got to the end boss and I called it out as the end boss, my co-op partner didn't believe me, then the credits rolled. We weren't impressed. 
It's as meh as you heard. 

Now, here's the problem, I dunno what WB is smoking but, trying to charge full price for this collection? I think I got all these games 4 years ago for 10 -15 bucks. Do, not, pay the full asking price for this. They're great games but they're fairly freaking old by now and there's no reason for them to be this much money."
76561198035900635,1518001903,True,"I just finished playing this game. How does it hold up in 2018?

Enemies don't just flank you, they actually have a self preservation routine. They work together, they even take note of your tactics and react accordingly.

The game's story is interesting but ultimately left me feeling unfulfilled because I never got the answers or wrap up I was looking for. The developers left that for the inferior sequels to fill in. (Story DLC, lol)
The atmosphere is great, I particularly enjoyed the more psychological horror aspect - the game gets under your skin in a big way. 

For a FPS this game is very long (16 hrs) and many of the excellently designed environments are recycled way too much, but that is OK by me since I was having so much fun playing the game.
Now on to the negatives: No controller support. This game was made at a time when controller support hadn't become a standard feature of PC gaming. These days many PC gamers (myself included) love to sit back on a 4K TV and play on the couch with an Xbox One controller in hand. I created a profile on Steam for the Xbox 360/One controller but a lack of native aim assist just cannot be overcome sadly. 

A particular irritant with this game is the torch, or lack thereof. It only lasts around 30 seconds. Then it magically recharges itself just to go out again 30 seconds later. I get that the developers were attempting to make the lack of available light a horror gimmick, but frankly it's more of an annoyance than anything. Why can't the US military afford a halfway decent torch? With my screen correctly calibrated, without a torch I simply cannot see anything in many areas of the game. I find myself not scared, but bored or irritated while I stand in place waiting for the torch to recharge again. It breaks the gameplay flow for me. 

I mentioned enjoying playing games on my 4K TV a moment ago, how does this game cope on modern TV's? 
Really well. I played the game in 4K resolution and implemented the fix (available on Steam)  that enlarged the game text. The game looked nice and sharp. It actually looks better now than when it was originally released. 
Since this game is still being sold on Steam it would be nice if the publishers saw to adding the community made fix into the game as an official patch, controller support would be nice too. 

If I were grading this game 2005 I would have given it a 9/10. Today it gets an 8.

Buy it, it's great!

This is the first game in the series, so pretty old, but still worth a play through.  You play as a member of a military unit whose name I can't remember, but is based on the FEAR acronym.  You go in with a squad to clean up a creepy military psychic-esp-supernatural type of experimental program that gets out of  hand.

Pros: 
-The AI on this game is the  best I've seen, especially considering its age
-The villian is really creepy, as is the atmosphere and soundtrack.
-The story is pretty good for the age of the game

Cons:
-There is a lot of maze-like levels with similar-looking rooms and  layouts that required a lot of searching and back-tracking to find the exit.  This got a little tedious after all the  enemies were gone.
- the game was created befoe widescreen monitors, so plays in a 4x3 window.

If like me, you like shooters, and somehow missed this series until now, I'd go for it-- especially if you can get it on sale.

This game still creeps me out sometimes like when Alma sometimes comes out of now where and that loud screeching sound, classic horror.

F.E.A.R. in all honesty was a very fun game that i played on the side but I will note that the gunplay does get a little bit repetitive so change up your weapons time to time.

The slow-mo in game is very fun and feels rewarding to get out of a sticky situation with it. I'm personally a fan of a lean feature which it does have in the game. There is a variety of weapons for Close range weapons - long range weapons. Graphics are pretty good for when it was made (Graphics was put to maximum)

Overall really enjoyed the game except for certain parts of the game where it felt slow but the good outweighs the bad. Definitely reccommend this to those who like a fun little shooter with a decent story."

76561198387050347,1517167640,True,"For a game released almost 16 years ago, F.E.A.R. and its expansions hold up impressively well. The gameplay is fast paced and satisfying, with plenty of nice particle effects and ragdolls that keep it consistently fun to play. 

One of the main things that is brought up when talking about this game is the excellent AI, and that is for good reason. The AI in this game was groundbreaking at the time and it still holds up today, with enemies capable of performing many different manoeuvres to try and gain the upper hand over the player when in a firefight. This makes the game quite challenging at times, even on normal difficulty as it is difficult to predict what the enemy is going to do next in each combat encounter. 

The horror aspect of this game is also great at times, with some very atmospheric environments and sequences that can really catch you off guard. However, if you go into this game thinking that it will be survival horror that can compete with games such as Dead Space or Resident Evil, you may be disappointed as the horror parts of this game rarely involve combat.

Overall, the original F.E.A.R. and its expansions are excellent, and it is by far the best game in the F.E.A.R. series. That being said, the price for the bundle is expensive when it isn't on sale, so I'd recommend that anyone who wishes to buy this game should wait for a steam sale or buy a key online if possible, because this game is really worth experiencing for fans of FPS and horror games."

It's an FPS that has a slow motion button and it plays super well.  For a game released in 2005, the AI are magnificent and the game still looks alright to boot (Except Persus Mandate).  Story can be hard to follow at times and really just takes a back seat to the gameplay.  Gameplay can get kinda repatitive, but the game ends before it really starts to drag on.

I would definitely recomend this game.  It plays well, looks well, and might even provide a scare or two.

Just be wary around the persus mandate expansion.  Is really a lower quality than the main game or extraction point.

Also, if you want just fear and not 2 or 3, hit up humble bundle; it's only in a 55 dollar bundle on steam now.

The complete pack isn't really worth buying because of the price and FEAR 3. Just get it on GOG or see if you can find a key online through certain retailers.
As for the game itself, it's one of the best FPS games ever made, a shining example of what FPS's were like before Call of Duty kind of infected the genre, also a run and gun game rather than a cover shooter. You won't be spending much time in cover apart from the times you're on 20 health or something, other than that you will be running and gunning to your heart's content. The rush paired with this game's bullet time (slow mo) mechanic, is a match made in heaven, no first person game has ever matched the style, fun factor and grace at executing a bullet time mechanic quite like FEAR has believe me.
A perfect blend of action and horror, this game certainly pulls off it's horror aspect also with it's atmosphere and tension. This game isn't like Doom 3 with it's scares, rather than it devolving into the equivelent of your little sibling jumping out of your closet and shouting ""BOO"" 50 times in a row, it remains consistantly nail biting and heart racing throughout.

FEAR 2 is a bit more cinimatic shootybang fest that IMO doesn't have the charm of the original, but is still worth a play.

FEAR 3 is, um, just not very good.

I highly reccomend all of them, except Perseus Mandate.

76561198120530775,1516424036,True,"This is a great game. Is quite entertaining. An FPS very well made, with several guns and good controls. You're a special operative looking for a dangerous dude and you end up in the middle of a corporation's sinister plot and supernatural forces tearing apart our fragile reality. The atmosphere is dark and the somewhat empty, impersonal environment of corporate buildings, industrial facilities and warehouses serves nicely to that uneasy feeling that keeps growing as the story unravels. I finished the original game in around 17 hours. It can be done in less, but I like to explore it all.

Found no bugs and had no crashes. Works fine on Win 7.

The story is good. The graphics are a little bit old, but they are still very decent. Great voice acting and effects. The game is intended for mature players and it delivers, as it is bloody, violent and, at times, scary. Pure fun, if you're into that kind of stuff... and if you also like to blow up almost everything, you will get the whole package. I gladly recommend it.

[h1] F.E.A.R. Extraction Point.	[/h1]

This is a lot of fun and as creepy as the main game. Also is long enough. But there's one bug and one that is very annoying. Luckily, there's a way to overcome it. You'll get to a part called ""The L"". The game will freeze almost at the start of it and that's it. The only solution is to go to a previous save before you went into that part or episode and go again from there. Then all should be good and you'll get to keep playing until the end. 
Besides that, there are a few new weapons and those are cool.

[h1] Perseus Mandate[/h1]

A solid third and final expansion. Again new weapons and some hard enemies. Still creepy and with nice jump scares. The game ends with an open ending that surely leads to the next game in the series.

F.E.A.R definitely is a good game. It's a fps/horror-esque game, and manages to combine both features nicely. The FPS part is defined by a small gallery of weapons that you can use to blast your way through humans, mechs, drones, ghosts, spooky girls, and a few more things i'll not name for the sake of the story.

The gunfights are good fun: The AI is smart; weapons look, sound, and feel like they have a lot of impact (nothing more fun than literally stapling your foes to the wall with a steel spike); there's the tactical aspect with the usage of mines and detonator grenades (trust me, with how good the AI is, you'll love these things), and they've added the extra layer of badass with a slow-motion feature!

Now for the horror aspect. There's a lot of gore, spooky apparitions, some nice jumpscares, and a few things that genuinely freaked me out, but to be fair: It's not all that scary. You can't really feel helpless when you have a Rocket Launcher in your pocket. The game definitely gives it a good effort, though. Especially in the last two chapters.

Storywise, this game does a good job for being an fps. It's not particularly easy to find all the clues (you have to pay a lot of attention to laptops in the game if you want to hear the story...), and you'll not understand most of it until the end of the game. But when you do, it's nice. Not really shocking, which is the feeling the game wants you to have, i believe.

There are only two real negatives:

For one: the game's too short. Plain and simple. I paid about 9 bucks for it, so i suppose it's only a minor detail, but it must've been more back when it first released. While the game certainly was good, i would not pay €30 for it if it only lasts 5 hours.

The second negative: The ending's a bit strange. I feel like this might be mostly my individual opinion. I knew i was reaching the end (thanks to the good storyline), but nothing really pointed in the direction that the ending took."

At times you feel like you're playing against humans.

Having just replayed it (jan 2018), yes, the graphics have dated a bit, but in a nice stylised way, almost feels like a graphic novel.
Sometimes it feels a little grindy, but when the grind is so good, who cares?
If I have a gripe about this game it's that I had to search for a solution to stuttering graphics.  Turns out there is a DLL required when you have logitech wireless keyboard or mouse.  Once I found it, the game ran buttery smooth.  IMO the DLL should be part of the default steam install."

From the gloomy start to the game to the posh set of the HQ to the runined suburb, this game keeps the ""fear"" element going throughout. This game also comes with a soundtrack that will keep u imersed for hours.

Id say £35 for all the original F.E.A.R games, basically the entire collection seems a bit steep but then yo are getting 6 games for this price.

Regarding: F.E.A.R., F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point, and F.E.A.R.: Perseus Mandate. I played all 3 games back-to-back.

Total Time to Beat: Just under 30 hours (Normal mode)
Keyboard and mouse: Easy to control
Bugs: none that I came across
Motionsickness: Yes. Because of a lot of halls and corridors I had a lot of nausea. I had to medicate for it.

I won't describe the ""about"" because the game's description already does a good job of what to expect and who you are in each game.

This was a very fun action horror fps game! I was compelled to keep moving and keep playing. The action was incredibly consistent which left me with only a couple minutes between each action segment to collect myself. The AI in the game actually impressed me...the AI was quite strategic at times at succeeded at killing me a few times. The Reflex action was fun as well, making me feel like I was in a slow-motion action movie kicking ass.

The story itself is revealed as you recover bits of data, although it was pretty much lost on me since I can't really recall anything. lol. I'm a goldfish.

Now for the horror: the horror is well scripted! Often used to lead the character futher into the game...you know you're on the right track when you start seeing weird shit. This game doesn't heavily rely on scares to make it work, but the not-so-frequent scares certainly add a nice flavour to it. I was often caught off guard when they happened, resulting in a yelp from me.

This game is OLD. F.E.A.R. released in 2005, but that does not change the fact that I seriously enjoyed these games! Yes, the age shows, but it wasn't a game breaker for me. At first I thought 'ew' but as I played, I became immersed, forgetting about the bad graphics. Honestly, if they remastered this game it would be amazing.

Upon completion of the last game, you unlock some Bonus Missions, I completed the first one, but got rekt in the other 2...never-the-less, I found them fun to play.

Would I recommend the F.E.A.R. games? Absolutely! I loved it. I loved the almost non-stop action. I loved the creepy stuff. A Must-Play in the action horror genre. 

(Reminder: At the time of this review, I also started F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, but this review does NOT include it or any other F.E.A.R. sequels.)"

76561197998672884,1515359891,False,"[b][u]Bottom Line[/u]: Get this game, but from GOG.com, NOT on Steam![/b]

The fact that you can no longer buy this game separate on Steam makes this unreasonable to purchase at its current price (55$ as of writing). But you CAN get it on GOG.com separate from 2 & 3 -- I'd recommend getting it from there instead, but I had it a looong time before this stupidity showed up. This is someone (probably WB Interactive, but who really knows) being a jerk.

Ignoring the price, F.E.A.R. is an excellent FPS that any fan of the genre should get. The ""spooky"" elements are all jumpscares, and relatively simple ones at that, but the gameplay and the little tidbits of story you get as you progress more than make up for its tameness. The AI is excellent, and even today the graphics are solid -- maybe not beautiful, but they certainly look good for a nearly-13-year-old game.

The expansions are worth getting as well (most sites nowadays include them with the base game); while [i]Perseus Mandate[/i] is a separate ""ending"" from the rest and suffers for it (but retains the excellent gameplay), [i]Extraction Point[/i] is necessary for the full experience, I'd say."

76561198047224402,1514968873,True,"This game is honestly a pure gem and HIGHLY underrated in my honest opinion. Despite it being an old game (from 11 years ago), and having even older looking graphics, this game honestly delivers a WHOLE LOT. A perfect mix of horror, action, scares, and thrills accompany this masterpiece, with so much attention to detail that the replayability is astoundingly high. I STILL start this wonderful game and it's expansions over and over just to experience them again and again. 

By attention to detail, I mean that even with limited graphics, no expense was spared to get things feeling real. When you shoot walls, their decals are accompanied by actual particle effect to make it look like the wall is realistically shattering from bullets (For instance, a shot at concrete makes it look like pieces broke apart and made a nice dent in the wall). When blood is around it drips if it's near a ledge. When explosions go off lights shake, swing, and flicker, doors are flung open, people and body parts go flying. Enemies communicate with each other, and react to things like fellow enemies dying, grenades being thrown at them, their numbers dwindling, or even you going into slow motion. They move into proper firing positions to try and pin you down then flank, and they only use grenades when you're bunkered down tight. 

Guns are a bit difficult to control. Sometimes I feel like I'm fighting the game itself just to be accurate, but none-the-less when I kill people it's satisfying as all hell to hear them yell and drop the floor after my attempts. And the scares actually deliver SCARES. Sure there's a few jumpscares, but I would be lying if I said a few times the ATMOSPHERE ITSELF did not set me off to the point a SHADOW would make me jump. Screw limited graphics, this thing STILL makes me crap myself whenever a spook comes up, and I'm begging god to just let me get through safely. I've actually had to quit Extraction Point a few times just to take a breather and relax before continuing. And the expansions are amazing and still deliver as well.

To be informative, Extraction Point and Perceus Mandate seem to be two somewhat seperate games, where Extraction Point focuses on spooking the player and setting their fear off, while Percus Mandate is more about shooting enemies and getting things done. Respectively, they're a ""Horror Focused"" take and an ""Action Focused "" take. So choose between them wisely.

All in all, these games are absolutely perfect Shooter/Horror games that I DEFINETLY recommend to anyone who loves to shoot things and be scared.

Final Rating: 10/10 Do Play.

76561198090308442,1514514229,True,"Pretty awesome, will satisfy both fans of the horror genre and action genre. Although throughout the campaign the horror and action aspect is most of the time divided, it just works. The game provides both amazing run and gun action and tactical shooting in the same time, putting you against enemy squads who co-operate surprisingly well. Truly one of the outstanding elements of this game are the firefights against rather great A.I., it’s presentation of weapons is amazing (for example : the SMG just FEELS at least 2x more powerful than a heavy machine gun in any other game), the horror pays homage to some classics and on top with the atmospheric lighting and effects in the game stands out even to this day. The slow-motion  power in this game doesn’t slow down the action like one would expect, but rather it enhances it due to the way the fighting scenes just look like. After a fight once you revisit an area for whatever reason you KNOW you have been there: blood splatter everywhere, majority of furniture destroyed, walls have cracks & bullet holes and you will just recognize your own trial of chaos. As far as the horror aspect goes you either have a nice buildup to it, or it may happen while you look around for scavenging thing like ammo and medic kits. There are also these upgrade syringes which upgrade either your health or slow motion time, but the game will either hide them rather well and fairly or put in in plain sight… where you can see them in an environment comparable to hell. Would recommend it more to high action FPS fans than horror fans (to which I’d also recommend the game)."

Story and Horror is a bit weak but some sequences are a bit spooky.

however that really is the only bad thing to say about this game
the gunplay is fantastic with a great variety of weapons and the enemy AI are good especially on the harder modes. The comms chatter between the enemies is a really nice touch and adds that feeling that you are being hunted down. 
Level design is great and despite the dated graphics it works well to creat a mildly creepy experience as you make your way through a variety of office, industrial and residential complexes.
The SP narrative is fantastic as you slowly uncovere the plot of wtaf is going on.
There is no skill tree or weapons to upgrade although there are many weapons to find along the way each with its own advantages and disadvantages and there are enough types of weapons to suit differing playstyles. 
The slowmo feature is a really nice touch and adds another element of awesomeness to the more intense fights.

76561198051317055,1514373496,True,"I remember watching the trailer for this game repeatedly on a trailer disc for xbox 360 games. Scared yet fascinated. I was 9 years old at the time. By the time I was 13 I wanted to buy it but employees at Game made me call my mom and she didn't allow me to play games rated higher than 16. My friends parents were more liberal so I gave him money to buy it for me. I was so happy!

I remember playing F.E.A.R. late at night with a bunch of friends over. We were scared together. We had fun. This game has scared me to tears. Granted I am easily scared... I still get shivers all over my body when Alma and her demons come to get me. I just beat the campaign for the forty eleventh time at age 22. Best FPS/horror game of all time. It does more than age well. It feels new every time I play it due to the AI. F.E.A.R. has the most intelligent AI I have ever encountered. They communicate and flank you. Flush you out with grenades and use cover. Clever clone...

I can't recommend this game enough. Even after 12 years it is more than worth it. If you're sceptical, send me a message and I'll buy it for you.

76561197971034014,1514037321,True,"If I were stuck on an island and was told you could only bring one FPS game with you - this is about as close as I get to having an assured answer.

Even now 11 (2017) years later F.E.A.R holds its own againts the new flashier and updated FPS games. Fear didnt need the perk systems, the alternate fires, the overblown budgets, and overthe top cinematic action sequences to capture a good time. Fear instead offered a simple industrial scenery and a story of lusts for power and dominion that back fire and become humanities nightmare at the hands of a mother and her son(s). 

Monolith Productions made a milestone here namely in its decision to offer an AI that thinks responds and counters the players actions. The only series as of recent that even compares to how adept the AI in Fear is, is BioShock, the AI in BIoshock actually thinks, meanwhile having just completed 4 times Wolfenstein The New Order all I can add is.... Machinegames should have gave Monolith a call and asked em how do you make a fun competitive AI. Interestingly enough Monolith's most recent product - Shadow of War features the nemesis system where the AI of the entire game changes its tactics based on your redundancies and comfort zones. I wont explain - go find out.

The drab and scary atmosphere of FEAR wasnt scary for me, but it was different, not resident evil type survival horror but the levels were a character in the game, you were operating within the games most notable foe, Alma and Fenil make numerous rightly timed appearances that for me, kept me conscious of my experience in FEAR, instead of just going from one hallway to the next gunning down the enemy.

Fear's slowmo was perfect, it was so satisfying to utilize, and in the same stroke not use, taking on an entire squad or mid level boss without the slowmo was extremely rewarding, playing through all of FEAR without slowmo, check the options or unbind the key, makes FEAR one hell of a tactical experience.

FEAR doesnt like new age graphics settings, I have an I7 a good chunk of ram, and a recent AMD gpu - its the game its not meant for high resolutions and widescreen but it will still run with a few tears, and glitches. Never big on graphics, and always hunting for another damn good take on FPS action - Fear delivered.

This game is a buy or sale, an odd note on FEAR's price, it sometimes on steam does not show a sales price, I indeed bought it on sale, yet the green % number next to its price and the slash through normal price was not apparent - look closer via putting it in cart.

Extraction Point - While this expansion is not canon - aka set in an alternate universe - its more of the same awesome FPS that FEAR delivered. If you wanted more of the same with a few new weapons and about 4 hours of wrecking havoc in offices, sewers, streets, and industrial complexes then its a buy.

Perseus Mandate - Set again in an alternate universe and slightly longer than extraction point at about 6 hours, and offering the new grenade launcher weapon, and Nightcrawler assault rifle, this is once again more of FEAR and Extraction Point, same graphics, same gameplay, extact. If you wanted more FEAR with a slight change of level design and scenery, then that is what your buying."

76561198148459273,1513556083,True,"Short answer: 
If you have the oppertunity to get this game, it's got the most fun combat you'll ever be able experience.

This is the most fun and over-the-top shooter that I've ever played. Every firefight is like a scene from an action flick with slow motion, explosions, particles, gunshots, gunplay, kung fu, and impressive AI. The graphics look a bit dated but the fantastic lighting holds up the presentation with it looking better than most games even in modern times. There's also a horror element which doesn't throw random jumpscares your way, however I found it that it is not subtle in it's delivery. As for negatives, things may get a little repetative since you basically fight the same bad guys, gunning down entire squads of them and proceeding to the next room for a scare and another enemy squad to maim and gib with your supply of weapons.  However if you can get over that, the combat is solid, the weapons are glorious (favorite being shotgun which can turn enemies into a shower of blood), slow-mo is fun and evens outs odds, and a few scares that might be frightening if you really try for them to be. 
So overall its a good game."

Wether it's because of the awesome gunplay, in my opinion unrivaled by any game, or the soundtrack, which is just masterful. But let's be fair, F.E.A.R. does pretty much everything right. Maybe the environment isn't as interesting as it could be, and the models and graphics are nothing like those of Half Life 2, which was older by the time F.E.A.R. was released, but in my opinion it doesn't necesarilly impact the game to the point where you look at it with disgust. I think that it creates this atmosphere, for which everyone loves this game. I give it 9.5/10 . Masterpiece."
76561198056291302,1513460666,True,Superb!
76561198041603555,1513414110,True,"F.E.A.R. is probably one of the best ""old school"" shooters that rely on medpacks, not shields, and (mostly) traditional weapons where you fight against an army (except the nightmares near the end). It has a gimmick, the ""bullet-time"" where time slows down and you can use it to take out a specific target or two, but you don't have that much ""juice"" for that (but if you find the various boosters you can expand your max health and max bullet time capacities. 

The story is pretty much ""you against the world"". Apparently, you're the ONLY guy who actually fights someone in this new outfit that fights weird stuff. In fact, the player was not even given a name, has no line of dialogue, and was colloquially called ""point man"". All your team mates had pretty much died horrible deaths, except for one or two, who seems to have no concern for their safety, esp. against threats that seem to turn people into giblets at a thought. But you don't play shooters for ""realism"", right? 

The blab was basically you're chasing around some weirdly telepathic guy called Paxton Fettel, who's supposed to be a ""psychic general"" for a clone army. Except, as you can probably guess, he went rogue, and his clone army took over the company ArmaChem which kept many many secrets. You and some Delta boys chase Fettel around, except all those Delta boys died and you go around alone. At some point, ArmaChem sends in their own ""ATC Security"" which fights both you and the clone army, even as ArmaChem tries to cover up their misdeeds, which you will find out at the end... 

You can ""lean"" around corners, but it didn't help with the game that much, IMHO. 

The weapons are varied, and all are lethal. From dual pistols to submachine, gatling gun to plasma, spike guns to sniper rifles, laser carbines to assault rifles.  Some are better for some things than others, but all are useful. There are also several types of grenades: regular HE, land mines, and remote ""sticky"" explosives.  

The enemies are quite smart, as they know how to circle and flank, use grenades, get behind cover, and so on. But they don't call in reinforcements. If you kill them in one area, that's it, no more will come. 

The game is full of horror moments, like flickering lights, dripping blood, bloody floors, bodies in chunks, appearing and disappearing ""visions"" and more. There are also a lot of exposition via recorded ""voicemail"" left on phones as well as various ""laptops"" that contain information. AND you get bits of hints dropped by Fettel himself, as he always drops hints about you, he, and ""Alma"", that little girl wearing red that appeared around bad things, are related somehow... 

The levels are long, and often there are clever ""barricades"" to turn your travel into a ""single-path maze"". There were not that many ""puzzles"" to solve or can't tell where to go. And the levels usually have more than a few paths so you can be flanked if you are not careful. However, there is no mini-map, not that you really need one. 

The graphics were good way back when, and still looks pretty good now, for a game that came out more than 10 years ago. 

All in all, it's fun to play, even today."
76561197964345647,1513387754,True,"This was a very cool and creepy FPS upon its release...

Great graphics, story and experience!

I repurchased these, even though I played through when they first came out.  I had waited for the sequals, so I own them but have yet to play through the entire series.

It is a cool game and worth playing for all FPS fans!

76561198343524872,1513137563,True,"Interesting story!

This game sure has one of the most interesting/wicked storylines for a game from it's time! The weapons are pretty unique and the little pieces of information you can grab, via answering machines and laptops, really help tell the story in depth. However, the gameplay is rather repetitive. The scares were few and far in between, and not to mention that the graphics are definitely dates. It's still not a bad game for those nostalgia hunters to try and experience before jumping into the rest of the series! UPDATE: DO NOT BOTHER WITH THE DLC. Extraction is complete trash, and Perseus Mandate... I honestly couldn't say if it was executed better or not because I did not play much into it. I tried for Extraction Point, but it got so glitchy by the end I couldn't tell what I was doing and most of the jump scares were messed up. And I play games like Wolfenstein II The New Colossus on max settings with a cool 160 fps. So as horrible as that was I just abandoned the Non-cannonical series."

76561198031976503,1512927189,False,"If you're scared of loud noises and find A.I. that hide around a corner until you shoot them while they offer absolutely no resistance to be the greatest A.I. in FPS history then this might be a game for you.

Every horror element added to the game involves a jump scare and that's about it. Someone will appear before you and there will be a loud noise to ensure that you know you're supposed to be scared at that moment.

The storyline has about the same depth as the scares. It's fairly generic (even for the time that this was released) and by the end I just wished it would skip the story to get me through the game faster.

The game falls flat as horror

Now let's look at the FPS portion of the game. I will admit that by the end I had hoped that they would just give me more people to kill instead of the super scary scenes but that is not because the gunplay is fun. It's just less tiring than the scares.

There's nothing enjoyable about firing the guns in this game. They're fairly basic and sadly interchangeable. There was no gun I would hate to drop in favor of another. It just boiled down to bullet count. 

It's difficult to make a game shotgun not be fun to use, but by the gods, they managed it.

The hyped up A.I. I am finding it difficult to comment on. I played it for the first playthrough on the second to highest difficulty so this could completely change in the highest difficulty. Most every fight started out with me taking one of the enemies out and then the rest hiding around a corner before I did the same to them. The regular A.I. didn't seem terribly intelligent to me. Maybe mine were defective.

The game fell flat as a FPS.

TL;DR Jumpscares and boring gunfights do not make for a solid horror fps."

F.E.A.R. is really good fps horror game. The AI in this game is really well designed.  Enemies have many and many different callouts and do a lot of stuff to really make you feel like you are taking on highly educated soldiers. They will throw grenades at you, try to flank you, knock out objects to cover and crawl under objects. Lighting and other visuals make this game feel so good. You get new weapons when going forward in the game and some of them are really cool. You can also kill enemies with slow motion, and that is really insanely good. Nothing negative to say about the game itself. 

Recently I have noticed that you can not buy the game itself anymore, you have to buy the whole package which includes all fear games and costs 55 euros. Fear was like 8 euros back in the day I got it. That is a big no no. Also the multiplayer is no longer available, that is bad since it was really good also. Game itself is really good, but those things are not. I can recommend the game, but as said above all that stuff made recently is not cool.

76561198044033677,1512310034,True,"Being over a decade old, FEAR has stood the test of time. Despite some shortcomings such as  repetitive environments and a undeveloped story, FEAR plays just as well as it did all those years ago. The  intense fire fights create  mass carnage as bullets shred chunks from walls, sparks and dust burst from surfaces, lights flicker  and gore  splatters  from your enemies. This is amplified by the sleek bullet time which is an absolute joy to use in  moments of complete chaos. The level desighn is also fantastic allowing for multiple routes for the player  or  the dynamic AI to flank  each other, creating continous  tension. While  the horror elements can be hit  or miss, Fear does scatter enough rightly timed jump scares to further mould the  palpitating atmosphere. In terms of sheer visceral combat however FEAR is still the king of the FPS throne.

The game pits you as a soldier going against an army of clone troopers led by a commander that is telepathically linked to the clone army. The game stands out on its own through the use of bullet time where you can slow combat down to avoid getting ripped to shreds as you deal with clone troopers that not only have numbers but also some squad tactics and chatter (the latter of which can reflect their situation, be it despair at how much of a threat you are to if you're gone with a response from other squadmates to shut up). Upping the ante is the atmosphere where what would seem like a simple fight against clone troopers becomes intertwined with supernatural elements, from radio static to a little girl in red appearing in places a child shouldn't be.

76561198089299679,1510812202,True,"The First F.E.A.R I ever played was actually the third one. I enjoyed that game very much and did a bit research on this Series.

To my Surprise, This first F.E.A.R game was considered as the FPS with the best AI in the last 20 years!!

Now that I finally set my mind to it and played this game I would have to agree this game is milestone piece of work in term of enemy AI. They will not charge at you blindly... They dodge, they hide, they hunker down, They Camp, They Bait, They grenade, they set up cross fire, They Flank and they will ambush you just like Real person. On Hardest difficulty every enemy encounter feels like playing against of a group of beginner CSGO player!!

Other than the AI. Everything else of the game feel aged. Graphic, Sound and voicing seems quite outdated but still within tolerable range. And it's quite a kicker of scary element as between every several encounter some jump scare or environmental scary moment will happen.

Solid 10 Hours of FPS content with no achievements. 

8.5/10. A masterful FPS with a bit outdated game engine. And YA….. There are scary little girls in this game.

- Well done mix of action and horror genres.
I have played F.E.A.R. many times and not even once I felt bored. The multiplayer was also fun but sadly it's not working anymore.

Graphics still hold up pretty well to this day, the issue with Logitech mouses can be easily solved by unplugging the mouse and then plugging it back in whenever the issue occurs. The story is well-done and if you're anything like me you'll love the game from beginning to end.

EDIT: The mouse bug is not completely solved by doing the above. The better (and more permanent) solution is to head to the guide linked at the bottom of this review, since it takes around 5 minutes to to do and should permanently fix the problem.

Pros 
Fantastic AI, better than most shooters today.
Graphics hold up today.
Should be able to run on any modern machine.
Atmosphere is done very well.
Good story.
Good voice-acting.
Runs fine on Windows 10.

Cons
As mentioned earlier, the Logitech mouse bug, which causes low framerate and stuttering every 20-30 minutes of play. (Easily fixed)
Environments rarely change.
Not much variety of enemies.
Occasionally the physics engine freaks out on certain objects and makes some really annoying noises. (Maybe don't count this one. Not exactly a significant issue.)

It's a great 6 hours of not-really-horror, as you use quick and sharp moves to clear rooms of varying enemies and uncover the mystery. Don't expect anything light or happy, everything in this world wants to bend you over and your only comapanionship is the voices on your comm.

Best shotgun of any game ever btw, treat it like a golden child and it will carry you anywhere.

Oh yeah more stuff, story is refreshing (nothing goes right) and ending can go anywhere, a great addition to what can be considered a perfect game.

76561198105558945,1509232117,True,"I actually like this game quite a bit. it is marketed as a horror game but it is far more interesting (in my opinion ) and intsead it is a sci-fi shooter kind in a similar light of half life. Though the combat in this game feels odd at points. The guns dont really feel like they are firing actual bullets but instead a laser of damage to deal on the enemys. I think this game tried to hold back to much on the cooler parts of the game like duel wielding and slowing down time to perserve the atmoshere of the gritty and ""horror"" like game. I love the melee combat, though not as useful, extremely fun to use, but again feeling almost unfinished. I'd still recomend this game though, for it just is a general nice experiance and I'd recomend this game if you are just a general fan of the sci-fi fps genre.

Also in case youre wondering the horror aspects aren't very well implemented or necessarily scary in my opinion. You may think differently though as I don't general get scared of too many video games, expecially if you have a gun."

The main horror elements are ""spooky"" ambient music played too loud and with no regard for context, so many flickering lights it gave me a headache, and hallucinations from an antagonist who has no intention of actually harming you. The levels are so long, uninteresting, and repetitive that it was hard to maintain a desire to finish. The graphics are so-so for a mid-2000s game, the shooter mechanics are about as clunky as most shooters from a decade prior, and the ""horror"" elements are laid on so thickly and inelegantly as to be self-defeating.

76561198152366953,1508084495,True,"Great game. I really like the combat and AI. The environments were a little bland and repetetive, but I understand why it was done so (to accomodate the AI and technical limitations due to those awesome particle and shader effects). The texture work (mostly) is very well done and the dynamic light system is phenomenal. The level design is mostly combat centric (accomodating the AI behaviours) which is a very unique thing and adds a different type of exploration system.

The game has a bit of problems with newer hardware but that is due to the old engine. My only major complaint is that, some sections of the game drags on for a bit too long, hence making the pacing a bit bad. And some enemy types weren't really necessary and for them alternate ways to take them down would have been better. But for a product of its time, the game is way ahead of it. Completed the game in the hardest difficulty and I am glad to do so.

Also, the story is somewhat touching (towards the end), and making me feel sympathatic for the antagonist was a great deal. But some subtleities, like the morality behind cloning human beings and using them as expendable soldiers and stuff like that wasn't really explored, as it could have added a whole new layer of depth to the already good game.

As an aspiring level designer, it was awesome to see that every place I quick saved was the exact spots where the checkpoints were placed. In the mean time I will be attemting the sequels. Hope they are somewhat good and not as bad as what I have read in some reviews. A big thumbs up from me on this one. Good job and have a nice day devs!"

76561197970314107,1507907811,True,"While it’s possible to make a quality game out of derivative elements, the challenge is improving on them in a way that keeps them from being a pure rehash. Most games that attempt to follow trends can’t manage to do it, while a scant few forge ahead in new and exciting ways. F.E.A.R. did this by combining the hot new bullet-time mechanic from classic noir shooter Max Payne with the hot new horror sensation of small disheveled children from The Ring. That might sound dumb as hell, but you won’t be worrying about that when you’re slide-kicking enemies through plate glass and shotgunning their limbs through skylights.

You play… actually they never refer to him by any sort of name or identifier in this game, come to think of it. He’s the strong, silent type who loves long walks in darkened offices and bullets that hit their marks. Mister Protagonist has been employed by the First Encounter Assault Recon team, a paranormal special forces team with a name that’s like if SWAT was named KILL. His first assignment is to chase down corpse-eating psychopath Paxton Fettel, an experimental soldier with psychic control over clone troops who’s decided recently to switch to an all-human diet. Your job is to find him and shoot him, and shoot all of his dudes, and maybe figure out why you need to shoot so many dudes all of a sudden.

This is complicated by the spooky little girl flitting about like an ADHD extra from The Ring. F.E.A.R. attempts to be a horror action shooter in an unusual way, by breaking up the intense gun battles with the aforementioned long walks down dark hallways, scootching through tight tunnels, and watching ghost people walk past windows. The overall atmosphere of the game is effective to this end, with your adventure taking you through abandoned offices, shadowy warehouses, and other mundane locales made sinister merely through moody lighting and an acute sense of isolation. However, punctuating the game with conspicuous NOW IS SCARYTIME segments drains a lot of tension from them. I won’t deny a few are quite effective (beware the air vents) but many rely on cheap jumpscares or atmosphere broken by the obvious telegraphing.

I’m front-loading my annoyance at the horror structure because I’m going to spend the rest of the review talking about the gunplay, and why it’s still some of the best the genre has ever produced. F.E.A.R. is first and foremost a first-person shooter, as is apparent from the moment you start trading shots with the paramilitary mooks in your path. Whenever the game isn’t trying to spook you, it’s throwing squads of trained soldiers at you to tear apart with akimbo pistols, shotguns, railguns, grenades, or a good old-fashioned slide kick.

F.E.A.R. comes to us from a strange in-between place before iron sights but after dynamic accuracy, during the height of bullet-time fever and right before regenerating health really took off. Your shootman is more accurate when standing still and can toggle “aim” that just zooms in a little, but this isn’t terribly important in light of his little slow-mo trick. You can trigger bullet-time using a bar of super-slow regenerating adrenaline to slow the game to a crawl, goofy low voices and Matrix effects and all. This is the key to taking on squads of swift, intelligent replica soldiers because they simply can’t react fast enough to you rounding a corner with a shotgun and disassembling them all in a moment.

I can’t overstate how incredible F.E.A.R.’s application of bullet-time is, thanks to a combination of vicious weapons and dynamic movement. Your melee attack turns into a jump kick in midair and a slide kick when crouching, with all impacts being instantly fatal. Pairing that with bullet-time, you can club one soldier to death, spin-kick his buddy next to him through a window, and slide kick the third guy across the room before he can get his safety off. Add to that grenades that gib on contact, a railgun that will ragdoll enemies through level geometry, and the greatest shotgun in video game history, and it is entirely possible to kill a roomful of troops and watch them all hit the floor in unison when your bullet-time wears off.

Twelve years out from release, this is still one of the best games around to load up and spar with enemies just for the hell of it. You won’t encounter more than a half-dozen types of military dudes but they come equipped with some of the best artificial intelligence ever gifted to game foes. I’m not making this up, entire articles have been written about the complex algorithms used to make these guys flank, fall back, fake you out, and fortify their positions. They make for significant challenges at higher difficulty levels, and delightful cannon fodder at the lower ones. And they even add to the horror factor on their own, especially when you run afoul of the more stealthy ones.

I’m not going to pretend the graphics are still amazing. They were at the time, of course, but they’re the kind of clean shapes and surfaces that lose a lot of impact in light of modern design. The particle effects and bullet impacts and chaos physics still do plenty of work, and the sound design will remind you constantly that your opponents are trained supersoldiers, that your weapons strike with the fury of the apocalypse, and that when combined they fill rooms with juicy viscera. Even the horror bits come into their own by the finale, and despite my earlier protests I think the game would be lessened without their inclusion. F.E.A.R. works best in that duality, in trying to make you fear and in putting the fear of God into your foes.

The AI is nothing short of a masterpiece of the genre, not to mention that it helps with the imersion and draws you further in to the games world. The horror aspect is no where near as significant as it was when I first played it but it is still enough to make you jump at times. I rebought the game to get the second and third installments as part of a bundle sale but it is one of those games you dont worry too much about owning twice, it's not like it wont get used.
Anyone who has never played it I would advise getting it, there are so many ways that this game is still superior to a huge amount of fps games out there."

76561198276369186,1507569700,True,I love this game so much. It has the best AI ever.
76561198095942758,1507486385,True,"If you haven't played FEAR, play it. It's as unique as any FPS could be. Literally. The gameplay is reminescent of Half life and CS GO. But this is no source engine game you're used to. It's like a step up. The AI responds to YOU, you don't respond to them. The AI is challenging, level design is on point, and the story is unique to a shooting gallery. 10/10, But if you want to know more before buying this classic;

The AI is easily the corner stone to this game. From the moment you walk into a room to the moment you leave, they mold the gameplay to how you proceed.  From the cover you choose, to the weapon you use. The AI has its own plans. If you're used to the typical Halo / CoD enemies, this will be a welcome change to you. No more dummy targets. They added a slow mo function just so you can survive period. They move FAST. Makes you feel like john wick as you blast targets running cover to cover, in between slow mo and regular speeds. 

Level design is just as good as the AI. It's different everytime. They don't reuse many assets or layouts. Even with how technically limited the game is, some scenes would surprise you. It reminds you that graphics are second to the atsmophere of the game.  It's usually industrial enviroments, or scenes comparable to game developement offices. There are some urban areas too. Assets aren't mix matched though. They're thinking how it looks and how it plays thoughout the design. 

Weapons are generic with a touch of flare. Nothing to exciting but I never got bored using them. 

It has a lot of CONS many FPS's have. But it's less severe. If you're used to CoD or Halo, this will be a fresh FPS experience and I couldn't recommend it more. Modern FPS's should take a note from the early days of FEAR."

F.E.A.R. has great combat and AI which outshines many games of today, the atmosphere is great and the level design is just complicated enough to feel confusing.

Unfortunately could only run it at 25 - 35 FPS in 1080p on my ASUS ROG GTX 1060 and FX 8350 but I can't really complain about a game from 2005 which told me 1080p wasn't optimised.

76561197988147035,1507097803,True,"I can say a few things about this game:
- It's a bit graphically outdated for todays standards;
- Story is very good;
- Too much shooting for my liking;
- Too much walking for my liking also;
- Enemy AI is as good as everyone praises, it got me many times;
- Sometimes you can miss crucial sooky moments;
- Easily findable upgrades;
- IMO not worth more than 1 playthrough."
76561198056422135,1507086229,True,"TL;DR - The plot is a genertic Scf-Fi story and it's servicable. The gameplay is a standard FPS shooter with normal FPS weaponry plus a few weapons unique to F.E.A.R. The AI is notably smart, but it's not as amazing as most people pedal it to be.


Plot: Armacham Technology Corporation is comissioned by the U.S military to create an army of clone soldiers commanded by a telepathic commander in hopes that the commander can avoid the danger of combat by commanding through their troops.

The player the takes control of ""Point Man"", an operative of a government organization known as F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon).

Paxton Fettel, a telepathic military commander in the clone army, is leading a revolt and the F.E.A.R team is deployed to to locate and capture Fettel, there by ending his clone revolt and containing the situation before it spirals out of control.

Gameplay:

F.E.A.R follows the standard FPS fourmla. 

Assault rifles (G2A2 Assault Rifle, ASP Rifle), smg (RPL Sub-Machinegun), pitsols (AT-14 Pistol, SM15 Machine Pistol), shotguns (VK-12 Combat Shotgun, Watson Automatic Shotgun), explostive weaponry (MOD-3 Multi-Rocket Launcher, M77 Remote Bomb, N6A3 Fragmentation Grenade, AT-S Proximity Mine), and speical weaponry unique to F.E.A.R (MP-50 Repeating Cannon, 10mm HV Penetrator, Type-7 Particle Weapon).

Of course if there's weaponry there's something to shoot. The enemy consists of two different sources. I will only discuss one though because the second - being the paranormal source - involves the plot. 

The clones apart of Fettel's battalion are one of the main obstacles for the player. On easy and normal the AI isn't much of a challege though they can be annoying on normal. On hard, they're well, hard. Normal and hard the AI is very intelligent. With that being said they're still subject to all the old tricks any veteran FPS player can dish out. It's not hard to outsmart the AI, but they're not as brainless as the rank and file FPS AI the industry is accustom to. The bet way I can put is it a more advance verison of the original Half-Life Marines.

Once aware of the player the AI gets straight to work trying to eliminate the player. Very aggressive and show apparent signs of enviroment awareness. Unlike most AI in FPS games where when the enemy knows of the player's general location they fire at said general location, the F.E.A.R AI will constantly move in order to maintain line of sight and by proxy line of fire. Even if they see the player, they generally wait until there's an opportunity to open fire. This makes them way more of a threat then say the Half-Life AI or maybe the AI from the Call of Duty games or [insert other FPS here]. Also, when I say ""very aggressive"", I mean VERY AGGRESSIVE. The AI does not stop unlil the player is dead and they stay on the offensive the whole engagement.

This brings me to the first thing I, personnelly, disliked about the game. The AI is, legitimately, too good at times. There were times on normal I almost gave on completing the game because of how good the AI was at combat. The game has a mechanic to negate the challeging AI where the player can slow time for a limited period. It makes every almost every single engagment a cake walk if used correctly. When I say I almost gave up on the game I ment that as I as frustrated because it was either the game was too difficult or too easy. If I engage the enemy toe-to-toe I'll parish, but if I use the time-slow function it's like kicking an orphan through a street hockey goal - the middle ground does not exist. Downgrading to easy is downgrading to easy so there's really no way to balance the game enough to suit me. The time-slow fuction is very fun actually, but it does completely negate the tactics of the AI.

Now I did say the AI was smart, but don't expect to be fighting the clones as if Rommel or Hannibal was leading them. They're just more fine tuned verisons of the standard industry FPS AI. The F.E.A.R AI should be the standard. It's not mind blowing, it's what I believe the minimum should be."

"
76561198081025980,1507024801,True,I played the demo before the game was ever released back on the xbox 360 days. I loved the demo but when the game was released I never got around to buying it. I don't know why cuz the demo was amazing. So I saw the fear collection on steam and figured let's finally get this game. So I got it now after 10 or something years of the original fear being released and I'm loving it way more than the demo :)
76561198227142044,1507010162,True,"this game was a challenge I haven't had in a long time, every encounter is different even after dying, they're never in the same place twice... though then again, sometimes the AI was dumb enough to hide behind things that doesn't cover them all the way...

p.s. turn on v-sync unless you like to hear possible coil whining... YMMV on this"
76561198168210750,1506984087,True,A classic.
76561197974780591,1506976891,True,"5/10 by todays standard.

Just going to mention the more memorable for me and the less mentioned in the review.

+ The dust/smoke build up from firing on debris and objects. This is simply genius. A very interesting technique to use. Not only does it obscure the vision when you track and fire on a target, it provides cover for the enemy to maneuver, hide and reposition or get close and attack. Would like to see this in more games really.

+ The background music/soundtrack. One of the best that i have heard that makes you unease.

+ Game ran very well on Win10 for me. Unlike the expansions.

- Too easy. Too many medkits and vests. Easy to headshot the foes with slow mo.

- Communication between the replicas, AI. Really, they name this game F.E.A.R and yet they do this? Isnt the unknown a potential fear? Part of fear? Fear of the unknown? They do this at times even BEFORE you encounter/spot them. They could of at least removed this from the higher difficulties above normal but unfortunatly not. This is really a let down.

- Narrow maps, small rooms, few pathways, ways for the AI to maneuver or around you(entry). Easy to predict the position of the AI, especially when they are communicating and with 3D audio positioning. Only time i felt the AI ""outmanuevered"" me and gave me a hard time keeping track of them was in the expansion Perseus Mandate on the Train depo(?) area, map where the AI had several pathways to pick and came in from various entrys that was on the flanks while also a few from the front whom i guess was there to grab your attention(focus) so you would engage them while those who spawned from the flank entrys, did just that, flank.

Nevertheless, interesting game to try and find out what this AI matter is all about. But i would also recommended it for its background music/soundtrack that puts you in a state of suspense at times."

If you love those games and think you'd enjoy another game that's basically a mash-up of those, then you'll probably enjoy this game. It's competently-made. No bugs as far as I could see.

If the idea of playing another Half-Life-like game sounds boring, you may not enjoy it.

I played it because I'd heard the AI was amazing, but it didn't strike me as any better than Halo 1's AI. The big thing here is that you will hear the AI soldiers ""talking"" to each other to announce what they're going to do next, which I guess may make them seem smarter.

I'm kind of luke-warm on the game, but it did manage to get me to finish it (10 hours), so I guess I'll give it a thumbs up."

76561197975256034,1506707803,False,"My hour and a half journey to try and make this game work.

At first the game crashed when starting the campaign, After messing with all possible causes as to why that would happened i tried reseting the game options by making a new profile in game, To my surprise the game actually started and i watched the first couple of cinematics, Foolishly thinking the problem was fixed i opened the options menu and not wanting to risk it only activated the subtitles and changed the controls, 30 seconds later the fucking thing crashed again.

When i reopened the game it couldn't access the save file i made, it was fucked, so i made yet another profile and started the game once more, skipped the cinematics and ONLY changed the controls, three keys i didn't like and the space bar because jump is unbound by default, 30 seconds later it fucking crashed again.

So i entered the game once more, made another profile and advanced through the first area, one minute in i ran into a blocked hallway which requires you to jump, So i opened the options and ONLY bound jump to the space bar, Right after i got past the blockage the game fucking crashed.

I can't get past the first hallway because jump is unbound, And if i bind it it fucks up my game. Unplayable.

Now i gotta tell who gifted me the game to refund it cause the shit doesn't fucking work."

76561197972369732,1506519296,True,"I played this game when it first came out in 2005 and thought it suffered greatly from being released a year after Half Life 2.  Half Life set the bar so high that I couldn't help but be disappointed by FEAR.

After revisiting the game recently, my opinion has changed somewhat.  I found the game quite enjoyable my second time around (once I was able to get it running properly on my current setup).  I did have some issues with my mouse at times, but was able to get those rectified through the FEAR community.

It's basically a linear horror based FPS (and could possibly be considered by some to be the original in that genre).

The horror elements are neat and do a good job of breaking up the run and gun segments, though the spacing of these ""horror"" portions becomes predictable.  You'll learn quickly when to expect a jump scare which makes them ineffective for the most part.  I also thought that the horror portions would have had more impact had the story not been so convoluted and hard to follow.  In the end I didn't care who I was killing or why.

The gunplay and slo-mo ability is really where this game shines.  The AI is decent and challenging.  A strategic approach to combat versus guns ablaze is the best approach and that is a welcome feature.


I'll give this a 7 out of 10.  My 2005 experience would have been about a 4 out of 10."

Basically on a modern $923910 system I ran the game at 24 fps UNLESS I get a fix.
Why do I have 24 fps? Well, the game has some programming which will open and close all HID-devices (keyboards, mice, webcams, the sort...) EVERY SINGLE FRAME OF THE GAME. The more devices, the slower you go, ruining the game.

The fix is to just download a DLL someone made which doesn't slow your game down. I now run it at (a minimum) 120 fps on maximum settings, which holds up fairly well to today's standards for me."

I mean, an enemy popping 'round the corner can give you a bigger scare than Alma who used to be one of the icons of horror games and stuff.

The single-player is a solid length, especially for how cheap it is now and how often it goes on sale. The Max Payne-ish bullet-time shooting is excellent and satisfying. The A.I. is good, though I recommend people who like a high difficulty to play on Veteran instead of Hard, as the game gives you lots of healing and ammunition to keep you going as long as you make it out of combat alive.

The horror elements of the game are fun, but not particularly frigtening. It is an FPS first and a horror-game second, so if you want it to be really scary, you'll likely be disappointed. However, it does have a decent atmosphere, and I did get jump-scared a couple times in my playthrough.

The only complaint I have is that whenever I would exit the game, my computer would be black-screened until I manually restarted it. I couldn't windows-key or ctrl+alt+delete out of it, so I had to really commit to playing it in long sessions.

I played all addons and highly recommend this game to anyone that likes 50% story 50% shooter. I find the story almost the same quality as Half Life, which I liked a lot."

76561198058828784,1504376210,False,just no
76561197979417445,1504299857,True,"It kind of sucks to me that F.E.A.R. is like a lost masterpiece to the modern gaming generation.

For a 2005 game, it has surprisingly amazing dynamic shaders & shadows. The game's stylized feeling and its graphics engine are just right enough to put you on edge in dimly lit rooms.
The game itself was developed with influence from eastern, specifically Asian horror, and its antagonists are mostly non-cliche. The way its horror is designed industrially and in an urban setting, always fighting in dimly-lit buildings and walkways, maintenance shafts and other miscellaneous locations. There are subtle mental cues that put you on edge. Its horror was designed in a specific way, leaving the player to their own thoughts and devices. There is little to no music in the game at all, leaving you to walk in silence in its industrial complexes, only the quiet, eerie ambience of its buildings enough to keep you sane. It leaves the player emotionally exhausted. The jumpscares are few and far between, but they are present. Most of the ""jumpscares"" you'll encounter in this game are solely sudden; no screaming noises.. just an omnipresent piece of terror. I'll give you one hint: LADDERS.

As put in a quote from one of its creative directors, ""Sure, in all these games, you have nothing, you gotta hide from it all. But when a little girl takes out an entire squad of professionally trained Delta guys, what then?""

Its shooter aspect is so amazing compared to modern games I still can't get over it. It has a full-blown melee system with martial arts and other sick moves for when you get up close to your enemy, almost like a first-person fighting game. Melee is not redundant in this game; it is a beautiful addition. The guns feel beefy and meaty, with heavy recoil but satisfying pay-off when you land a blow on a Replica. Its weapon variety is massive, including the 10mm HV Penetrator, essentially a weaponized nail gun, instead firing large metal stakes straight into your opponents, which of course dynamically paints the walls with their blood and pins their limp corpses to said walls. Firefights are majestically done, your character having a supernatural ability that activates bullet time for a managed amount of time. It is surprisingly not overpowered and you will find yourself using it a lot in fights inside the game. When bullets fly through the room, dust clouds it, particles and sparks flying off of drywall and metal objects respectively. Its grenades are terrifying in the greatest way, each detonation making the lights in the room flicker as paper scraps and dust particles fog the room, the entirety of it shaking with shockwave from the blast.

And on to its artificial intelligence.. it is still the best AI in any first person shooter to date that I have seen. Its entirely badass Replicas, the clone soldiers under Paxton Fettel's psychic command, are a serious threat to you and your health. They will pull off their own martial arts in close quarters if you are to try and get close to them, leading you to counter their atttacks with your own melee abilities. Their AI is constantly aware, searching for the player vehemently as you hear them communicating with eachother (dynamically, in engine, may I add!), about your whereabouts and their positions. As you enter a firefight, they react quickly, tossing down things like tables and other various furniture and environmental aids for cover. Screaming your position in their comms, they notice you jump over their hastily arranged fortification, reacting with a loud ""FUCK!!"" as you blast them to pieces mid-bullet time with your shotgun. The other replicas react quickly as well, tossing grenades in your direction and communicating your combat effectiveness to their allies. As you near a fire extinguisher, one of them takes note and screams ""BY THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER!!"" as he takes a precision shot at it, dazing you as it explodes in a puff of white powder. As they rush you, you head for cover, only to toss a grenade into their general direction as the room shakes from the blast, the only remains of the Replicas now a limp ragdoll and various bloody pieces.. that is, until the door busts down and you see a Heavy Replica with that 10mm Stake-gun.. uh oh.

All in all, F.E.A.R. is a wonderfully crafted masterpiece for the ages, taking place as one of my few favorite games from my childhood. With spendid AI mechanics, that match almost no games to date, an amazing and beefy shooter mechanic with eerie, edge-of-your-seat horror, the segments in this game will leave you both craving more and feeling exhausted, emotionally."

Extraction Point:
At the beginning of this part, Paxton Fettel says ""This doesn`t make any sense, I know."" And he was right - this expansion indeed is the weirdest part in all franchise. Not only it isn`t cannon - since Pointman and Gin ended up in different place in FEAR 3 - but it doesn`t bring anything new. Boring combat - one abandoned warehouse after another. Lack of story. Just...just skip it. Totally not worth it.

Perseus Mandate:
Actually this part was the first one I played. It`s quite interesting, compared to previous expansion. New story, new team, new protagonist, new guns and a new faction to fight against. Seriously - poor clones don`t deserve to be main antagonists of these series. Mercs are tougher - especially those acrobats - so they are more fun to play with. Alas, this part is also considered non-cannon and I wonder why. We don`t see what happened to original heroes and our mission takes us elsewhere."

/Incredible to see how well this game has aged and how much it's superior to most AAA shooters from our time.

If you've never played F.E.A.R, do yourself a service and buy it. While the port has some performance issues, you get a full package with the original game, and both of its expansions, one of them being arguably superior to the original game. The experience is astonishing even by today's standards, with the high points being both the atmosphere and the gameplay F.E.A.R presents you with. 

Basically an original and surprisingly harmonious mix between a John Woo flick, a Ghost In the Shell hommage, a Hideo Nakata horror movie, and some Resident Evil-esque level of nonsense, complete with an evil corporation, clone soldiers, and a creepy little girl, F.E.A.R is a classic, a game so well done even its graphic engine still looks good despite the fact that the game dates back from 2005. The shadows, the lighting, the models are still really well done, the game features some really impressive body awareness and a really great physics and particle engine, the latter giving an amazing touch to the gunfights of the game. 

While the environments, mainly composed of industrial complexes and business offices, can get really repetitive, the incredibly agressive AI of the Replica soldiers make each encounter memorable, with your enemies trying to outsmart you and forcing you to go out of your way to survive each one of them . F.E.A.R is linear, but none other game has captured the fury, violence and beauty of a cinematic gunfight. With the addition of a well crafted horrific aspect, F.E.A.R has it all. Including a Nail-Gun called the Penetrator, always a plus in my book.

Ps: Play on the Expert difficulty to get a sense of how good the AI is.\"

F.E.A.R. come out in 2005. few days before Halloween and got an immemorial hype!.

This game is one of the best games I ever play! 

I remember all going crazy about the insane good graphics that F.E.A.R. have. It was just unreal good for that time.

Walking alone in the dark with only my pistol and a flashlight, expecting Alma to scare me to dead!

Oh yeah I can definitely say that F.E.A.R. mark my childhood. I will never forget those spooky fridays back in 2005.

And now when I can finally play this awesome game in his full glory with 60 FPS, and maximum settings with 2K resolution, makes my heart complete! 


Review:


Story:

 The whole campaign is unbelievable exciting from start to end. Spooky dark moments looks like the best Japanese horror movies. Alma is definitely one of the most charismatic characters ever see in a video game. His dark  presence and unknown origin makes the game to a whole another level.


Atmosphere:

 F.E.A.R.  got the best, the craziest, the the scariest and the most realistic dark horror atmosphere ever see in a video game. Amazing light effects are unbelievable. Every peace of light that u got from your flashlight is a bless. Because when you walk in the dark all by your own not knowing what's coming next is just unforgettable experience.

Sound:

 The sound of weapons are so good that you will think you shooting with real gun. Soundtrack is one of the best in any video game. Never boring, always intimidating for sure gives a whole new dimension to the games atmosphere. The sound of a broken glass is what I still dream when i sleep... Just unbelievable reality. Voice acting is amazing, especially from Jun Sun Kwon who is one of the most charismatic girl in a video game.

Graphics:

F.,E.A.R. looks he come out in 2017.  The game looks absolutely amazing. Environment is so detailed and sharp that is a real bless to just stand and admire the graphics. When you fire a gun and hit an enemy, you can literally  see how every bullet tear the flash from the body.  With ultra realistic blood effects, lightning from the shooting, overwhelming grenade explosions and realistic physics makes F.E.A.R. one of the best looking game in history. The Graphics are total perfection. 


AI:

F.E.A.R. also have one of the smartest enemies every see in a video game. This guys will cover behind walls, kick a table to create a shield for themselves or even call for a backup when they see they losing a fight. You will literally feel like you are shooting a real person.


CONCLUSION:

F.E.A.R. have one of the most memorable scenes ever. With breathtaking graphics, fantastic gameplay, smart AI, stunning sound effects, scary horror atmosphere and great story makes F.EA.R. the most perfect game in history. 
F.E.A.R. just shine in every single element !

-TOTAL PERFECTION!

10/10 


Best Regards!"
76561198087345773,1503559672,True,"After 12 years since the game has been out, it still shines as a solid shooter with intense combat. This was one of the first FPS I ever played when I was a kid and it left a deep lasting impression on my mind at that time. As with most of my reviews, here are the subparts covering every aspect of the game-

1-Graphics- This game still has one of the best graphics and the attention to detail in combat situations is visually appealing, especially when you turn on slow motion and see individual bullets spraying across the room creating body and environmental decals everywhere. The aftermath of the shootout is a treat to witness as the environment is badly damaged with bodies of enemies lying around. The hallucination effects are also well done. This was the first game in which I could see my character's face in the water reflection fully if the graphic details are set to high :) . I admit some of the environment gets a bit repetitive after a while but the combat and action makes you engaged.

2-Gameplay- You have a variety of guns at your disposal like pistols, shotguns, machineguns and some heavy weapons with which you kill the enemies. I have to say that one of the best things about this game is the A.I. of the enemies. I have never seen them behave so realistically and they will outsmart you in a number of ways. They make strategic decisions to outnumber you and you have to listen to their talk to decide what they are about to do which makes every fight unique in its own way. You also fight some supernatural elements although not much. I wish more developers take inspiration from it and we see more realistic AI. Some people say that it gets a bit repetitive after a while as you kill the same number of enemies over and over again but the combat intensity allows a lot of flexibility. One recommendation I can give is to play the game on medium to high difficulty settings with minimal use of slow motion. It gets very tough to beat. This is a game from 2005 and it still surprises me to this day.

3- Story- A great story which is told in a suspenseful manner with some supernatural spooky vibes thrown here. Its scary and disturbing. In a nutshell, Paxton Fettel, a psychic commander with telepathic link to hundreds of clone soldiers has gone rogue and started kidnapping people working at a defense contractor firm, ATC, and killing them to obtain information on a little girl. Your job is to kill Fettel so that the telepathic link to the soldiers is broken and they are rendered useless. That's all I can say on it as it goes deeper the more you find his true intentions and that of ATC. 

4- Sound and atmosphere- The sound is well done and sounds great during firefights and explosions. The atmosphere is good and is really creepy when you get hallucinations of the supernatural elements in the game. Back in 2005 when I played it I had nightmares about it. It may not hold up to today's standards now considering the amount of scary games we have in the market now, but its still great.

I had some issues running the game on Windows 10, as it is quite old, however I was able to solve it by setting my resolution manually in the game's launcher.exe file and it ran perfect after that. Earlier I was having issues where the game would constantly crash when I set my resolution manually through the in game graphics options.You can look through the steam forums, there are quite a number of fixes to run this game on Windows 10, and it does run properly once you tweak the settings.

Overall, if you are looking for an intense FPS game with some spooky atmosphere and a good story, I recommend this one.

76561198002753001,1503428433,False,"I played FEAR 2 and 3 first and loved these games. 

I've been playing this game in hard and reached about 50%.

FEAR 1 is, in my opinion, a few tweaks away of being a 10/10 game.

-Almost all the weapons are burst fire(even a rocket launcher) WHY?!! And the burst is super inaccurate.
-The enemies have aimbot, literally. The weakest enemy in the game will shred you in seconds.
-The same enemy sometimes takes one headshot to die other times about 10.
-Enemies have WAY too much HP, feels like every enemy is a semi-boss.
-Turret sections are dumb, they don't have a puzzle or meaning, they're just you getting pounded hard.
-Lack of ammo for any weapon that isn't the SMG or the Assault Rifle later on.
-The optimization is garbage so the game will stutter on a Quad-SLI Titan Xp rig.
-The subtitles don't scale with the resolution so they are super small.
-The story is pretty broken.
-The level design is horrible, everything feels like a non-sensical maze and you have to walk around trying to find a small switch or air duct.
-There's a dumb black fog so sometimes for no reason you can't see 4 meters in front of you even with the flashlight.
-Enemies' arms are like jello, they bend and glitch in weird ways when shooting you while moving or dying.


There are pros like the amazingly programmed A.I. or the graphics. But overall, in 2017, I just can't recommend this."
76561198022160541,1503406566,False,"It's good, but it's not THAT good, so here's my contrarian opinion. I do agree that the AI is great and the shooting feels pretty satisfying with the decent weapon line-up. However the environments are very dull, the level design in mundane, the movement speed is comically slow and the 'horror' element is honestly pathetic. Give it a try if you're curious, it's far from being poor; I just fundamentally disagree that it's an essential must-play FPS on the level of doom or duke nukem 3D. It just isn't."
76561198081324918,1503393146,False,"If you have epilepsy, do not get this game. The gunfire is very intense."
76561198172265561,1503329124,False,"It feels like an awkwardly blended bad Japanese horror film combined with a bad shooter game. While at first, the horror aspect is done pretty well, as the slow pace and atmosphere create a very horrific setting, eventually, the horror devolves into annoying shooting sequences where you basically can't move and just have to cover yourself from things flying at you in an open circle. The guns are awkward as all hell. Most of them are burst fire, which means if you hold the fire button, when you release it, you're typically going to waste a few bullets. Not that that should matter too much, considering how much ammo there is lying around for most guns. Most guns also don't feel like they do a whole lot of damage. A lot of people praise the AI in Fear, as they should. Not many shooter games have enemy squads that actually feel like...squads. They work together. They get mad at each other sometimes. They flank you, cover each other, spot light coming from your flashlight, and throw grenades, all of which would be good things, except grenades in single player shooters suck, especially when you run as slow as you do in this game, and being flanked is tough to deal with, because again, the movement speed is incredibly slow. As far as graphics go, it looks like if you decided to run a Source game in 4k. The story is confusing as all hell and ends awfully. My only consolation is that it was $5 for the bundle of the entire series"

76561198053487973,1503235487,True,"If you are expecting my Nosferatu review, but F.E.A.R. flavoured, then get out.

F.E.A.R. is most likely my favourite horror fps ever. And I played Resident Evil 7.
But I am not here to talk about the base game, but rather the expansion packs that come with the game. Enough has been said about the OG F.E.A.R., so I will be shining some light onto the expansion packs instead.

Extraction Point
The first expansion in the series, Extraction Point is what Opposing Force was to Half Life: An amazing standalone story that added new enemies and weapons while contributing to the plot of the game without going too far. Simply put, this is the base game taken to the extreme. You have new replica types coming out the ass, new spooky stuff that will genuinly scare you, and new weapons that WILL make you feel like a rampaging space marine with time slowing abilities. New locations are added as well, and the opening fight of the game is just great to experiance. I won't spoil anything this expansion will offer, its better to see for yourself. Then theres the atmosphere, which after experiancing, WILL make you feel nihilistic and filled with hoplessness. As I am writing this, my mind still has flashbacks of all the horrible things I experianced ingame. There has been no other game that has done this. Oh, and did I forget the fact that the A.I was improved as well? The things those replicas do....

Perseus Mandate
Now you are most likely going to think I am going to say that this is what Blue Shift is to Half Life: A boring expansion with no new weapons to use, no new foes to fight, and a boring plot that will not make sense. Well, you're wrong. VERY wrong. This, like Extraction Point, adds MORE weapons, MORE enemies, and this time a decent storyline that will make you feel a bit confused, but still enjoyable nonetheless. Theres a new enemy faction to add more variety to the replicas, and these guys are massive breath of air for the opposition. Without spoiling them, I will only state that you will not believe what these guys will pull of during gameplay. Once again, new areas are shown, and while some are just Extraction Points backwards, the rest is all original. The atmosphere, however, has tooken a blow, as now the game somewhat feels like a dudebro movie with some scares sprinkled around. Maybe it has to do with the A.I teammates that follow you around for a good duration of the game....

+Combat (fun and challenging)
+Graphics (containing level of detail, props, effects, and assets that are pretty good in my opinion for a game that's over 10 years old)
+Story (slow, but interesting for a mistery lover)

Cons:
-Story development (game is pretty slow overall, which is very noticeable specially when going through levels. You will feel like you are sometimes killing simply because you have to)
-Lack of basic controls or commands (no frequent autosaves, no running, mediocre sensitivity slider. I guess the game does feel old in that aspect, so keep in mind that you have to be open and adapt to the different controllers)

Pretty good game to begin the series."
76561197995425573,1502856169,True,"F.E.A.R. doesn't have the most original story to tell. It's not the scariest game; heck, I'm not totally sure it's even a [i]horror[/i] game. It's graphics have dated. And it's an absolute blast.

What F.E.A.R excels at is a great moment to moment experience; between the game's remarkably clever AI and a veritable plethora of powerful and satisfying weapons at your disposal, there's a lot here to like. Every single shot fired has real weight, and the particle effects and environmental destruction it produces a delightful and punchy flow to combat. When you couple this with the game's bullet-time mechanic, gunfights feel like tense ballets. (Perhaps ballet is the wrong term; I played half of this game to James Brown's ""The Payback."") And mentioned earlier, the AI is sharp and lethal. Even as powerful as F.E.A.R.'s protagonist (the ""point man,"" as he's referred to in game) can feel, the tactical nature of the game's enemies mean that even a small handful of enemies can prove deadly.

Of course, the game has its faults too. The middle portion of the game is dragged out for far too long, and the pacing can be a bit all over the place. The story is reasonably enjoyable but feels half-baked; much here is left to be desired, and the ending of the game just feels weak, [spoiler]with the brutal AI replaced with one-shot, attack-in-droves, unremarkable, ghost enemies[/spoiler]. For that matter, the horror aspects of the game are just okay. There's nothing here that'll keep you up at night or truly [i]frighten[/i] you (though I personally suspect the horror tone was more to create an atmosphere of tension than to produce a real ""horror"" game).

No, the joy of F.E.A.R. isn't the game's narrative, nor is the game's vague pretensions at horror. What makes F.E.A.R worth a purchase is the gleefully over-the-top gunfights and meaty combat that makes up the vast bulk of the title's content. If you want my suggestion, play DMX's ""X Gon' Give It To Ya"" in an open tab and go nuts. F.E.A.R. isn't exactly what it's advertised as, but it's still well worth the trip."

76561198079719265,1502635036,True,"TL;DR F.E.A.R + Extraction Point & Perseus Mandate are covered in this review for the sake of easier accesibility to all new and returning players checking reviews. Yes, it's a positive review, more info below.

F.E.A.R is regarded officially as the canon story(developer accepted narrative) while the stand alones which followed a few years later are regarded as non-canon. But even so, EC and PM are incredibly immerssive and they serve more than fillings for potholes that developers ,generally, tend to leave around in their games. 

EC and PM followed the first game's formula and perfected it even further. I cannot describe it properly, but the maximum difficulty on the first game seems a lot more lenient compared to the latter.

Satisfyingly so, as I've enjoyed them fully on a weekend's worth of fun. Moreover, I can say that the trio aged beautifully over the years. I mean,

just check the year they were launched...

THESE GAMES WERE AHEAD OF THEIR TIME, JESUS!

Both the immerssive feeling, horror outlines and gun play are amazingly structured. The certain improvements that can be debated about the game are not need in my opinion since the recipe is perfectly designed. The games play diffierently every time you re-install them, epic replayability. 

THAT

is the reason why I savoured EVERY second of this game. It wasn't too short, it wasn't too long. It's perfect!"

76561198151066474,1502535262,True,"The story is crap, the graphics are only slightly above the minimal requirements and it's not remotely scary despite what many(for some unknown reason) will say. How this game has been featured in so many ""scariest games"" list is beyond my understanding.

That being said, none of that matters. What you have here is an EXTREMELY FUN mostly linear FPS shoot em up that plays like Max Payne; what with environments and items that react to getting shot, slo-mo, a fairly diverse arsenal(although you can only hold on to a few weapons at a time, bummer) and nonstop firefights.

Computer monitors will explode with electricity when shot, papers on desks will fly everywhere, metal surfaces will spark when fired upon, and fire hydrants blow up. This combined with a bullet-time ability makes for endless fun. Aside from the Max Payne series, F.E.A.R. is the only game that comes to mind when I think of the bullet-time ability done perfectly. There's a few melee combat tricks you can pull off but aside from the normal ""hit them with your gun"" attack these are largely just for show.

Every encounter is randomly generated meaning that every time you fight a squad of enemies it will play out differently, even if you reload a save. Also, the enemy A.I. is superb. You can hear your enemies call out commands to eachother based on what's happening and I've never seen another game pull this off so seemlessly(usually enemy A.I. has a fair amount of hiccups and are largely idiots. Especially in games that came out around this time).

The weapons are fun to play with you've got your assault rifles, a submachine gun, an awesome pump shotgun(that you may have already heard about, it rivals Half-Life's shotgun in notoriety), a sniper rifle, a gun that shoots stakes at semi-auto that can nail enemies to the wall(fun as hell), and plenty of explosives among other things.

If you were hoping to be scared or intrigued by any kind of story, then go in with little to no expectations. However if you're fine with a game being carried by awesome gameplay and a fairly healthy length, look no further. 

There's also two expansions that will provide you with at LEAST 6 more hours of the same unique gunplay if you haven't had your fill by the end of it. I highly recommend you play F.E.A.R. and its two expansions."

76561198026068022,1502431500,True,"Quick note:
If you experience poor framerate, the fix is here
https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/789-directinput-fps-fix/

F.E.A.R. is timeless classic that combines dull world, full of mundane office spaces and warehouses [spoiler](designers' idea was definitely to try recreate real world with, at the time, improved rendering fidelity to immerse player into the game world and its story better + make supernatural events and surreal secret laboratories stand out all the more, but ended up with world looking colourless, forcing textures to have a rather restrained palette - they fixed it in FEAR2, but sadly dumbed down the gameplay instead)[/spoiler] with great movie action soundtrack and absolutely unparalleled enemy behavior.
The levels might look boring, the horror elements might not work for some players, but what Monolith good at, is all there (well-written, engaging dialogues, sound design with psychotic attention to little details, guns that are nice to use all the way through, eye pleasing visual effects at the time of release), but your main course is confrontation with enemies that validate your every move, all up to hearing you knocking off a coffee mug from the table - they WILL flank you and bring your аss down as a team.

Without a doubt, FEAR has the most badass explosive barrels in entire history of first person shooters.

F.E.A.R. Extraction Point, however, is a third-party developer expansion that is not very good and missing all the fine-tuning of the original game (dialogues are bland and full of nothing, but constant moping, the audiologs are unimaginative and don't add anything of interest to the narrative; ambient sound design is practically non-existent or full of errors, like when you can hear server buzzing in the janitor's closet; the music is popping in out of nowhere and fade away just as obnoxiously, often leaving you in complete silence). The only redeeming factor is well-directed gruesome death of one of your teammates that properly horrifies you.

F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate is second expansion from same dev team, where they remixed a formula a little bit by adding several unique looking levels, new weapons and enemy flavors, and finally stopped trying to take the story too seriously, which made NPC dialogues sound slightly more tolerable, though the voice acting talents are still non-existent, the lines sound forced and not as unconstrained / natural as in the original, but still - considerably better attempt than utterly bad fanfic-tier writing of the previous expansion.
It has its moments (like, the most notable improvement over the original was the setpiece with a massive robot stalking you in building, on a floor right above you, when you can hear their every step and are nervously waiting for it to jump you by breaking the floor under its own weight)

Try out the main game, the expansions are 'take it or leave it' as they add nothing of value to your experience, unless of course you'd want more of the same gameplay, but degraded in every other department, compared to the base game.

P.S. Do play FEAR 2, because Monolith made absolutely everything better in it (except for, maybe, dumbing down the gameplay to make it more comfortable for the console peasants to control). Narrative-wise, it's ""Escape from L.A."" type of a sequel that's both self-aware of how ridiculous and over the top its premise is and yet it still takes itself seriously."

76561198025554716,1501477343,True,"FEAR is a good time for those who like single player FPS. The horror aspects are a mixed bag, but the moment-to-moment combat in this game is still unmatched. The AI has been mentioned at length in thinkpiece after thinkpiece, but I think the game's use of physics really helps the game hold up, even with its somewhat dated visuals. The term ""visceral"" also gets thrown around when talking about combat in games, but FEAR is actually ""visceral"". Guns and explosions essentially paint normally mundane settings such as sewers and office buildings with the blood of your enemies. Weapons also have punchy, bass-y sound design that remind you of the carnage they can create as well.  Although the settings are very mundane and uninteresting, level architecture combines with the game's impressive AI keeps the game fresh on another playthrough, and the game is at its best when the AI uses the level to its advantage, whether by attempting to flank the player in squads, flushing you out from cover with grenades, or even flipping over vending machines to make cover in some cases, among a myriad of other tricks. 

There's also the ability to use slow-motion at any time, which not only looks awesome, but also keeps the game pretty accessible, even to those who aren't particularly good at shooters.

FEAR's story is fine, but it's not great. The plot is a little predictable, and it doesn't help that it's mostly told through jump scares. The mini-stories told through the various laptops and voicemails scattered around FEAR's levels are thankfully more interesting. Then again, nobody should play FEAR for its plot. 

Extraction Point is also fun, even if it's very similar to the base game(But that's not a bad thing at all). Extraction Point does have more interesting horror elements  than the base game by a country mile, and also introduces more interesting settings that aren't in the base game. I haven't played Perseus Mandate, but I hear it's not great."

76561197981870277,1501194477,True,"2 decades later and F.E.A.R. is still amazing, easily one of the best shooters for PC, along with Quake, Half-Life, Unreal, Doom, Halo and Duke Nukem 3D.

Some stuff has aged masterfully, like the smooth controls, the music, sound design, weapon variety, the creepy and oppressive atmosphere and the now legendary enemy AI that's still so rare in modern FPS games.

The graphics are kind of a mixed bag for modern standards, this comes from the awkward era from the transition between the 6th to 7th generation of consoles, it kind of looks like an OG Xbox game, but it has more detailed models, complex shaders and particle effects that wouldn't be possible on that console. The art direction is pretty solid and consistent throughout the entire game, although the environment design can get a little tiring after a while.

The game is surprisingly well optimized for modern hardware, looks great on 1080p at a near constant 60 fps, with a few dips here and there thanks to said particle effects in heated battles. Unfortunately, you can't activate the built in antialiasing option along with the soft shadows option, so it's recommended you use a post-processing AA solution like Nvidia's FXAA, AMD's MLAA or SweetFX's SMAA, personally I prefer SMAA for this game.

All in all, a masterpiece from Monolith.

Unfortunately, this package also includes the game's expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate and these two definitely ain't Opposing Force, they feel more like the crappy unofficial Duke Nukem 3D expansions. In both expansions, the level design is uninspired (more warehouses and offices... yaaaay...) and the atmosphere is an absolute joke, Monolith knew how to create an amazing and foreboding atmosphere and these expansions utterly fail at emulating the beautiful atmosphere from the original, instead both focuses on the most tedious aspects from the original, which is shooting a lot in drab, dull and grey warehouses and offices.

Perseus Mandate is the better of the two expansions, but also the shortest, although it really doesn't offer anything new to the story other than introducing more supernatural fluff to confuse you even more. There's a reason why Monolith doesn't consider the expansions as canon, although FEAR 2 still picks up a few ideas from the expansions and it's still just as bonkers and confusing, but I digress.

Buy this for the original FEAR alone and forget that the expansions exists, heck, you can delete them without any problem after the game finishes installing to gain back a few extra GB of space."
76561197963057549,1501174745,True,"Good throwback game. A little boring at times - not enough gunplay - but enjoyable still, the slo-mo keeps it fun.
The expansion packs also come under this same review so I'll say something about them here too.

76561198130753090,1500884724,True,"This is a fantastic game, and the most rewarding single player FPS I can remember playing.

If, that is, you play it right. 

Difficulty? Max it. 

Slo-mo? Un-bind it. 

Now play.

You'll get killed. Pretty damn quickly too. Probably more than once. Then you'll eat a grenade while lurking behind a box. 

Persist.

Soon you'll see that this is no run-and-gun Call of Duty style shooter. You can't move very fast. Your enemies can kill you easily. Cover is your friend. It's also your enemies friend. By the way, they are smart. Really smart. 

They flank. Constantly shift cover. Make cover if they don't have it (sorry bookshelf/table/fridge). They suppress and advance, dive thru windows, grenade you when in cover, bum rush you if they get desperate, and even ambush you if they are the last man standing. Yes they'll do dumb shit on occasion -- it's AI, not magic -- but on the whole these 'clone soldiers' feel more alive and unpredictable than some human opponents.

And really, that unpredictability is the best part. 

I had to replay some of the more challenging sections multiple times (Max difficulty remember: one or two mis-steps and you're dead). Although enemy numbers, spawn point, and loadout tend to be fixed, these firefights never played out the same way twice, which meant I could never just 'learn the pattern' -- instead I had to be on my toes the entire time, because even one enemy getting the drop on me could be the end.

You'll notice that, so far, I've talked about nothing but the gunplay. That's because FEAR does a lot of things right, but IMO only one thing spectacularly. 

On the rest of it: 

Weapons vary from good to great (stake gun FTW!), but best of all have distinct advantages/weaknesses that make your loadout a real point of strategy -- the art is uninspired, but the graphics hold up well -- the level design is superb in offering a 'dual-path' design that diverges and converges throughout, but is otherwise repetitive and, again, visually dull -- the scares are uneven, though there are some good jumps to be had -- the story was un-engaging and cryptic to me, albeit less so than most horror outings -- and the voice acting is particularly good for an FPS of this vintage.

9.5/10 (I guess. I hate scores.)"
76561197972040704,1500861770,False,"I originally played and completed F.E.A.R. shortly after the disc version originally launched years back.

I felt that F.E.A.R. was a combination of a cliche, creepy Japanese-style telekinetic murder girl, uninteresting characters, first person shooter gameplay with bullet time and melee combat since those were big at the time, a story where nothing happens except at the beginning and near the very end, and last but not least: possibly the most boring locations I've ever been to in a video game.

When I was younger, playing GoldenEye on my N64 for the tenth or so time, I remembered thinking to myself: ""Wow, part of what makes this game fun is just how many locations I get to go to! On top of a Russian dam for a few minutes, then inside it with secret evil plans, an arctic tundra, a missile base, a cruise ship, a jungle, an underground lair, a cave system, a communication cradle thingy, oh and the streets of Russia in a tank, the interior of a train, a Russian cemetery at night, a Russian police group thing's headquarters, and probably others I'm forgetting!

Wanna know where you go in F.E.A.R.? I would estimate that less than 25% - but I'll be liberal here and say 25% to the game's betterment) is warehouse and industrial properties in cities. 75% or so of the game takes place in an office building. Prepare to be walking around through office floors, hallways, meeting rooms, cafeterias, etc., for hours. There are a few robot enemies, and some invisible guys will attack you, and an occasional big guy who is tough to kill will show up, but the majority of the enemies are generic humn cloned soldiers. If not for the creepy Japanese horror girl, this game would be one of the most bland games in existence, because the locations did not interest me at all, and that is coming from an introvert who tends to love indoor areas in games, and enjoys offices even in real life.

Not only did I find the locations and enemies to be lackluster, but the story tried hard to be less interesting than the setting. Most of the game, nothing happens...your objective is ""Kill Paxton Fettel"" for almost the entire game, and they have the audacity to post that as your objective repeatedly in game. Imagine if you played a Batman game and they nagged you to ""catch the Joker!"" on every loading screen or every time you looked in the menu, for virtually the entire length of the game. You will be chasing Paxton Fettel for probably 90% of the game, and nothing really happens plot-wise of much relevance until you do get to him. To me, this game was bankrupt of plot, not bothering with it except to open and close the story on the game.

Considering the title acronym spells a word to invoke horror, the horror angle is obviously an important selling factor. The game has a few jump scares here and there, if that is your thing. As a shooter, F.E.A.R. is competent, but there are so many other shooters I had actual fun with. As a horror game, I jumped probably 3 to 5 times, as I recall. Nothing really terrified me or made me feel uncomfortable. If you want actual horror, I found Prey 2017 and Alien Isolation to both be games that unnerved me based on quality scares instead of spawning in a creepy Japanese murder girl with loud sounds because F.E.A.R. doesn't know how to do horror with tact, at least in my opinion.

There's not much left to say about F.E.A.R. It's basically devoid of anything I liked. The bullet time and melee were okay enough, but so many other games offer gameplay that is as good - if not better- and the other aspects of those other games such as interesting/likable characters, relevant events all throughout the game, objectives that change throughout the game, neat locations, etc. all entertained me far more than what F.E.A.R. had to offer. I cannot recommend F.E.A.R. as it is one of the most bland big-release gaming experiences I've ever had in my life."

The combat is so cool because it feels tactical, and a lot of this is due to F.E.A.R.'s AI. The AI in fear will move from cover to cover (and sometimes even throw a box down to make their own) to flank you, all while communicating with each other. If they see you're behind cover, than they will yell, ""I'm flushing him out!"" Then throw a grenade near your position to try to get you out of cover. If there are only a few of them and they see you, than they will call for backup. These are only a few examples. This is the smartest AI I've ever seen in a shooter game.

76561198023856019,1500435416,False,"As a late-comer to the game, it's hard for me to write a review that captures how I really feel about the game. It's an old game - it just is... But is this a bad thing? Well, for its time, it was quite revolutionary in its AI development, partical physics, subtle scare tactics complimenting in your face horror, and lighting effects. Playing in 2017, the graphical aspects weren't anything spectacular, but I didn't expect them to be - we've come a ridiculously long way since then lol The AI is something that people gush over allllll the time when they talk about the game, and I have to agree with them for the most part. Hearing the enemy communicate and act on commands and prompts was interesting and could definitely put you in a spot of trouble or help you catch a massive case of death. The sparse enemy variation means that you'll be able to figure out fairly quickly how enemies operate and be able to deal with them, but that doesn't mean they'll act the exact same way every fight. The gunplay isn't bad - double pistols is still double pistols (looks badass but isn't accurate in the slightest), shotguns blow up enemies at close range, and long range combat is appropriately difficult. All this being said, I wanted to like this game. I REEEEEALLY wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. Mostly because of the horror aspect. The game just isn't scary. Like in the slightest - not by today's standards, anyway. There's just too many ridiculously scary games out there - many of them probably taking notes from this game but with better hardware to power there spooky visions. The story of Alma and her quest for revenge is still and will always be bloody and tragic, but it's just not enough for a recommendation from me. If you're looking for a classic FPS that was an excellent stepping stone for its time, you've found it. If not and you're like me looking for a scary military FPS, then you'll probably feel about like I do."
76561198063594343,1500372292,True,"The decision to pick up F.E.A.R has formed in my head while I was scouring the internet for anything akin to Max Payne or simply featuring fast-paced CQB as the main focus of the game.  Apparently this game has attained a cult following that arduously adulates it as the pinnacle of AI in modern shooters, tactical combat, horror etc. . For these reasons I plunged into the game with crisp enthusiasm only to be pummelled down by a virulent hailstorm of various quirks, flaws and redundancies. Despite the game being praised mainly for its slow motion based combat, the actual shootout comprise maybe around half of the game. The rest is filled up with tremendously obnoxious trudging across the blandest most generic environments  imaginable (such. as kabillion times copypasted industrial areas, warehouses, sewers and so on) while occasionally facing some kind of wannabe level design riddle which predominantly revolves around fumbling around in search for some hidden valve or a switch in order to proceed further to doing the exact same thing over and over again or for a change ''get spooked'' by one of those supposedly terrifying jump-scares. Speaking of which, besides gunning down foes by dozens, you are also expected to be consterned by myriad recurring boogiemen and especially one boogiegirl/woman who blow up in your face every once in a while. These instances may seem haunting for a couple of times, yet as soon as you realize they are consummately harmless and the only way you can somehow interact  with them is merely by standing indolently and watching, they lose any potential effect. Due to an undefinable exigence of the developers these days, all this running and gunning spiced up by insipid wraith peek-a-boo is brewed in a repugnantly gurgling and disgustingly burbing cauldron in a dismal attempt to convey a story. Provided you my exulted read deem intermittently appearing senseless cutscenes smelted together with fragments of dialogue transpiring both from all the miserable characters partaking and collectible recorder messages (primarily presenting you with a highly thrilling and your background lore knowledge expanding lines such as: Eh hey, Jess, Tony here, I couldn't come to the meeting, cuz there was some power shortage on my block, blah blah, see you later. ) After finishing the game following a god awful ending, you comprehend even less of the story than you did and really just wonder, why Monolith studious even bothered to implement an all pervading narrative into the game. Adressing the ending, it leaves an impression that a certain competition for creating the worst ending possible must have taken place at the time of release and apparently the authors of the game strove incissively to achieve the grand prize. Gotta admit, the almost made it no doubt. You anticipated a huge gun-toting massacre at the end? Oh silly, this is F.E.A.R, something special, that doesn't need any kind of epic showdown with hordes of baddies.  Nonetheless, the base of combat in this game remains undeniably one of the most excellent and versatile single-player FPS experiences ever. As you blast your way through enemies organized into small squads you are challenged by a co-operating, strategically thinking foe whose reactions are different on every playthrough garnished with splattering blood, crushing glass and squawking guns. Still, even this aspect of the game progressivelly degrades through the game, since you start encountering armored bullet-sponges in form of special soldiers, irritating flying robots and pointless sentry towers.  Even so, I feel bound to recommend this game if only for the sake of those 3-4 hours spent spraying rounds at close-knit teams of hostile commandos. 

In the regard of the DLC, I played only a part of Extraction Point so far and in all honesty, I did find it much more entertaining than the base game. Finally you get to smoke some punks for at least 30 minutes in row without any interruptions and the action feels much more consistent. Of course, this does not go without issues, for the story is now completely barren of any sense and the first sentence with which you are confronted by the main villain could summarize it as whole: You killled me, that doesn't make any sense, not that anything does anymore. So characters killed of in the base game jump back to living and become even more pesky and garrulous than before."

-Interesting story and tapes to hear what happened to the citizens and workers.

Cons:
-Nothing really"
76561197972959988,1498845367,True,"I still remember when one of my old PC rigs really struggled to play this game.  When it was released, these graphics were very close to being state of the art, especially with the shadows and real time lighting.  Fast forward to today, and the graphics actually hold up fairly well, although the low resolution on the textures and awkward facial animations stand out a bit.

The AI, on the other hand, is still one of the best AI's in the business.  Its quick to react to what you're trying to do, and its pretty aggressive in trying to force you out into the open.  Don't be too surprised to find the AI maneuvering to outflank you, using cover fire to keep you hunkered down, and well placed grenades to flush you out.  A lot of modern games could really learn some lessons from this AI system.

Of course, the biggest draw to this game is the thrills and chills.  The horror elements aren't hurt too much by the graphics quality, and the game design goes a long way to amp up the forboding elements that make a great horror game.  Granted, the story is a bit difficult to follow, but it never lets off the gas, either.

At the end of the day, this is one of those gems thats a bit forgotten about.  Coming out in the same era as other heavy hitters like Half Life 2, DOOM 3, FarCry, and the original Call of Duty, this game is left out of the discussions of great FPS games far too often.  The muliplayer probably had something to do with that since it wasn't really all that memorable, but the single player portion was definitely a cut above.

Classic Score: 9/10
Modern Score: 7/10"
76561198205315159,1498800073,True,Perfect Game. That's all that needs to be said.
76561198044154631,1498756509,True,"An extremely fun shooting game!

Positives:
- Enemies are split into squads instead of coming at you in waves. This is more fun in my opinion because each encounter can become unique instead of just sitting at one spot while each brain dead enemy appears.
- Slow motion is really fun, especially with how the physics engine shows every detail of your destruction. You can see a grenade distort the surroundings before exploding. You can see the enemies fly back after blasting them. Particle effects everywhere while you kick an enemy's face in mid air.
- Each gun feels great to use, especially the shotgun!
- Enemies are actually pretty smart and react accordingly to what you're doing.
- The game's spooky feeling is so much better than being barraged with jumpscares, 
- The dark and gritty atmosphere crawls into your skin.

Negatives:
- Too short in my opinion.
- The environments can get repetitive.
- You can't aim down sight. Minor thing,
- If you have Logitech, you have to disable a few things in your devices for it to run at a proper frame rate. Don't know why this happens.

Overall definitely worth checking out, although the other games in the series aren't that great,,,"
76561198210779245,1498702459,True,"This game was interesting. Did I get scared? Not at all really, a few jumps, that's it. So, not nescessarily a horror game even though there are horror elements incorporated into the game, it's more of an fps in a way. The level design first of all was very linear, not much exploration at all, apart from a few rooms with supplies here and there, and maybe 2 routes if you need to go around an obsticle of some sort, but for the most part pretty linear. I did see some cool A.I behaviour, not 100% sure if scripted or not, but at one point, an enemy NPC knocked over a fridge for cover, but this only happened once, that was pretty cool. The A.I can be silly at times, for example if a sall portion of their body is not covered by a wall, they'll just stand there and take shots from me, not even moving. And also, it would be nice if they investigated sounds more, if they come across dead comrades, they will scout out the area, and if there's another route to your position, they attempt to flank you, which is great. The enemy ai work together allot, constantly calling out commands to each other and doing different tactics depending on the situation. So the ai, really impressive for an old game. There was quite a few weapons in the game as well, not that much, but you encounter the big guns later on in the game. The gunplay works great, I enjoyed the experience however, hoenstly I never used the reflex ability as well as melee oftn because I didn't really get situations to use them in, of course mostly because I was playing on the default difficulty, and I died quite allot, so the game is still challenging on the preset, which is nice. There were honestly no real memerable characters in the game, maybe apart from the commander on the radio, and the stupid individual you come across, can't even remember their names honestly, not much interaction between the characters, and you're just really a generic soldier for the most part. The story is certainly interesting however, as you get to find you mor about Project Origin and Alma by getting intel from laptops which you encounter throughout the game and learn how sick the people behind it were. The voicemails were a nice touch, but nothing of real interest, just the callers talking to people in the office, so I didn't really pay much attention as it wasn't really interesting. I enjoyed my experience with the game but honestly, it isn't my cup of tea, wheather you will like it or not, is for you to decide. unfortunatly, no real replay value (anymore) as they multiplier is discontinued due to Gamespy servers shutting down and the linear level design and no choices to make. Not the greatest game out there, but it was something. Oh and as for bugs, I got a bug whihc happened twice in a row after my first encounter with Alma, and once the cutscene played, it didn't end and my character was locked in position, worked after 2 reloads though. Also got stuck inside doors a few times, only once where I had to reload though. That was about it.

The DLC's also offer something new, new enemies, new weapons, new situations, new horror scenes etc etc. And I really can't say anything more about them other than the main points in the review."

[h1]Positives:[/h1]

+ Good shooter, with a few different guns to use. Energy projectile weapons, rocket launchers, repeating shotguns, rifles, pistols etc. Shootouts can be a lot of fun.
+ Badass soundtrack matching mission environments.
+ About 30 hours of gameplay (with the DLC), which is impressive for an FPS.


[h1]Mixed:[/h1] 

~ Story is OK, but it is light on details and not well conveyed during the game, resulting in confusion. For a horror themed game it is not frightening either.


[h1]Negatives:[/h1]

- Graphics suck, game is pretty old. It would have been good visually for the time of release, but by today's standards it isn't great.
- Combat, while satisfying, can also be a bit monotonous with only a limited variety of enemies encountered in the whole game. Such a breeze as well - plenty of ammo, med kits, grenades and body armour to use. I played on extreme difficulty and the only thing that was ""extreme"" was the ease at which I completed levels.

6.5/10

Really solid shooter but lacking in critical areas."

76561198090095977,1498595190,True,"This game fails to achieve its main goal of integrating horror into a raw FPS game. The pacing between the ""scary"" and the ""action"" is done terribly. The characters and story are mediocre. If I were to hear a description of the game, I would never have considered buying it.

But playing it was a much different experience. With other games I get tired of all the shooting and just want to finish the game already. I did not have this issue with F.E.A.R. It has a perfect blend of ""you can't move like that, you're toting a gun and all this equipment"" and ""you're a freaking ninja"" to make the movement feel just right, and I enjoy the small effort put into the platforming and melee combat to make the game more than just sprinting and shooting.

Consider this game as more of a shooter done right than a horror done wrong. Not sure if it's worth full price, but I guess if 10 bucks isn't worth a whole lot to you this game will be a worthwhile playthrough. Also would recommend the Perseus Mandate DLC but maybe not Extraction Point, it goes in a wrong direction that worsens in the next two installments.

76561198016347979,1498267182,True,"F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon is a horror first-person shooter that was released in Oct 17, 2005. For those unaware of this game, this game at the time of release was praised for its good graphics, game mechanics, storyline, and AI system - which to this day still blows out other FPS AI's out of the water.

Here's the story:
You work in a government military, employed under the name ""F.E.A.R."" - abbreviated for ""First Encounter Assault Recon"", to handle extreme paranormal activities that pose a threat. Your name is only known as ""Pointman"" - which is an indivdual who leads the way and tries to handle the threat firsthand. You are tasked to handle a situation that resulted in unusual paranormal activity that caused casaulties, only to realize that Paxton Fettel is behind these deaths and that he is controlling a battalion of elite soldiers who can only be commanded by indivduals who have psychic powers. As you continue, you soon realize that the main cause for this sudden threat is Alma - a girl with dangerous psychic powers that was tested and experimented on by a company - where she is trying to set herself free and Fettel is there to help. You are to eliminate Fettel and prevent the release of Alma, but you must fight the elite soldiers that stand in your way and the hallucations Alma places on you that provide some good scares.

The game mechanics in this game are simple, but provide a great gameplay experience that is satisifying to witness - even for a 12 year old game(at the time of this review). You can lean to help take gun battles with the battles, melee the enemies with style (whether you bicycle kick them, whack them with your gun, or slide kick). If that isn't much to you, you have the ability to slow down time and quickly take on multiple enemies.

However, the enemies will try their best to ""eliminate the threat"". The AI in this game will work with each other to outplay and take down the player - whether that is flanking you when you're not paying attention, throwing grenades to get you out of a area, or grouping together to take you down. If you were to compare some FPS title's AI to F.E.A.R.'s AI, you'd see that F.E.A.R.'s AI is vastly superior than those few titles (and yes, there are titles where the AI is veeeeery bad and playing this game will show you a whole world difference with good and bad AI's).

For the graphics, it's a 2005 game and it still looks okay. At the time, it was pretty good looking game and that you needed a decent system to play this game on all Max settings. Hopefully, you should be able to MAX out the settings of the game if you were to pick this up. (A side note: Look up ""FEAR FPS issue"" and look for a Steam guide that involves replacing a .dll file with a patched .dll that deals with your FPS being really low despite having a good system and not having anything hog resources).

As for the OST, it's solid and does its job to giving the player a unique experience.

All in all, this game is incredibly fun to play and gives you a good scare time to time. The story is solid and if you're looking for a game that can offer some challenge, this is a title for you. Maybe after a first normal mode playthrough, play on the ""Extreme"" difficulty setting - that's where you can see the AI in work.

to expect when going in this game if your new to this.
( First 8 hours )
This actually plays like a multiplayer shooter where you die and respawn alot and  it swears
up and down its a horror shooter, well maybe so but i dont feel any fear but what i do feel
is this anger inside me building up to a vicious rage at how this plays, if you arent good at
multiplayer shooters dont you dare pick this up!

( Next 4 hours )
I think I'm actually getting good at 12 hours, im still getting gunned down alot but out of
rage that i paid for this crap i wont quit, see cause i hate this game and a have a real
hate for everything so anger fuels me!

( 3 hours later ) 
I am a walking nightmare, I will make every npc in this game suffer like no other
cause you have brought out a monster inside me i forgot i had, hate is power
and let me tell you, wait a sec I got gud didnt I? I am enjoying this now wtf?

( 6 hours after )
I started to notice that the fun is gone, the office setting can be confusing with
no map, the game actually feels cheap cause you can feel they went out of
their way to set traps and make flanking you easy by overwhelming numbers.

I can recommend this if you want a shooter based on difficulty first then
some horror to add to it but dont expect much of that this is really a 
shooter that thinks its scary."

I mean, I'm playing it like 10 years after release and it still holds up, specially the AI.

It's like some kinde of adult life simulator, you run around an endless office building for hours shooting people that want to hurt you (work life) being chased some times by a little girl (parental responsibilities) or a screeching naked she-monster that kills you on contact (relationships) until everything goes dark and ends with a huge and confusing explosion.

76561197993464013,1497715157,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of the most under-rated FPS titles out there. The creepy moments are extra creepy. The special effects flying everywhere during a major gunfight looks impressive enough on its own but this game features ""bullet-time"" so you can go into a slow motion mode and gain that extra advantage over your enemies. The story is very unique and cool, complete with mind controlled clone soldiers and ghosts that can kill you.

As a note: For Windows 10 users, I had to run this and its expansions in XP compatibility mode in order to get it working properly. The games would crash on exit without it so I stress that you enable that compatibility mode just to be safe.

As for the expansions: I don't think I will be able to review those separately so I will go ahead and say that they are both awesome.

The first one, Extraction Point, carries directly on from the end of the main game. It provides a depressing but encapsulating ending to the story. It has a bit more creepyness than the main game and plenty of the same action. One thing to note though; this is one of two story endings for F.E.A.R. The game F.E.A.R. 2 is a direct sequel to the main game as well which does not agree canonically with this expansion. Personally, I think both should be played since they were developed by different teams and both provide an entertaining experience. So play F.E.A.R. and these two expansions and then get your mindset back to the end of the first F.E.A.R. and move on to F.E.A.R. 2.

The second one, Perseus Mandate, is a side story to the main game and provides the same creepyness and action-packed gameplay but with new weapons and enemies. This was originally released back in the day as a standalone expansion and is definitely good enough to be its own game."

76561198007428578,1497210663,True,"FEAR is a horror FPS which puts you as a member of an elite special forces unit tasked with stopping a psychic controlled army. 

It's a 10 year old game by now but I found its managed to hold up well enough. The graphics look dated but on the plus side it should be possible to play at almost max settings even on an underpowered machine. 

The enemy AI is impressive and even feels better than the AI in some more modern titles. The enemies in FEAR will work together to take you down. They'll lay down covering fire while their comrades try to advance or outflank you and move from cover to cover. Its even possible to mislead them by firing from one position and moving unseen to another alowing you to flank them.

The games horror elements are a bit hit and miss. It does tend to rely a lot on jump scares but it does do a good job of creating a tense atmosphere. The lighting and shadows in the game are well utilized to add to the atmosphere sometimes plummeting you into darkess lit only by your torch.

You also get two DLC expansions with the game, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. Extraction Point continues from the end of the main story and Perseus Mandate has you playing as another FEAR operative in parallel to the events of the main game. Both DLCs were only average really as its pretty much more of the same with a couple of extra weapons and enemy types. Also the story of both expansions were retconned for the sequel so they're only worth playing if you are left wanting more after finishing the main game. Also the screen resolution options for the DLCS are more limited than the main game for some reason.

Overall FEAR is a really decent FPS even if its a bit dated. Worth getting if you enjoy FPS or horror games."

76561198008214637,1497179445,True,"[h1] F.E.A.R (2005) - An inefficient anti-paranormal military squad with most efficient person for the job. [/h1]

F.E.A.R (First Encounter Assault Recon) is horror FPS-action game made in 2005 by Monolith Productions. It's been a favorite of many gamers for various reasons. F.E.A.R was indeed technically very advanced and probably was too much for most computers at the time. Now, for me this game is overrated, but certainly not a bad game. I just don't have any nostalgia classes for this one, unlike Half-Life and Halo: Combat Evolved.

As I've said, F.E.A.R was technically good at the time and in some situations, it still has an affect on me. Graphics are obviously outdated, but lighting is still fantastic, which is probably the main reason why I don't consider this game bad when it comes to graphics. F.E.A.R manages to create an atmopsheric enviroments and also looks cool when shooting sections come with many items getting destroyed. It does remind me of some action films.

But most people probably know this game by it's slow-mo ability. It's been done before with Max Payne, but it doesn't take away from the game. In fact, it helps with the fact that player has unnaturely good reflexes and most people without them would've been killed by replica soldiers. Combat without slow-mo is very difficult, which can be a good challenge to complete for those who want to try it. Slow-mo also makes shooting sections much more awesome when you see the bullet impacts, smoke and areas getting bombarded with bullets and explosives.

Many people talk about A.I in this game like it is a best A.I ever seen in a video game. I don't really think A.I is that special. It simply works, because map design is simple. It has enough room for A.I to make a move, but since areas aren't that large, it doesn't give room for errors and bugs. I would say that A.I is great, but if you really want fantastic A.I, look for a game where there is large area, but try to find out if A.I uses it as its advantage. Most difficulty you find in this game, is enemy accuracy and damage. Stealth is not good option, because A.I has VERY GOOD hearing range and sometimes I noticed that replicas magically knew where I was despite me making almost no sound. So. there are some sections where A.I's difficulty doesn't come from their ""thinking"", but from their scripted ablities and accuracy.

F.E.A.R does have a decent story and it starts well, but in my opinion isn't that interesting at the last 1/3 of the game. Scare factors disappears when Alma's hallucinations are getting tiresome. [spoiler] I'm honestly baffled why releasing Alma was even considered a good action. Harlan Wade was an idiot. I should mention the fact that Alma is unnecessarily aggressive towards the player even when she realized that The Point Man is her son. Sometimes she protects him, but sometimes shows aggressive thoughts and her minions attack player. I never understood why. Even if you are a ghost, you would think that your son/daughter would be someone who you would protect at all costs. This is the most stupid part of F.E.A.R and it does take away from its story a bit. [/spoiler]

I don't consider writing a longer review, but if you want me to do it, let me know in the comments.

[b] PROS (GREAT): [/b]
+ Gunplay is incredibly good for it's time and still works really well.
+ Slow-mo separates player from normal people and makes shooting much more fun
+ Lighting in this game is something that most developers should consider when making a horror game.
+ Atmosphere and music

[b] PROS (GOOD): [/b]
+ A.I is smarter than average ones in modern games, but despite of most people saying, it's still something that could've been improved. Still, I would consider this game as an example of good A.I programming.
+ Good amount of weapons. There could be more in all honesty, but they feel different and actually have different outcomes. Also, the carrying limit is three guns and five grenades each, which is enough.
+ Story is presented well and the best part, in my opinion, is the first 1/3 of F.E.A.R. The rest is just alright.
+ As I played on hard difficulty, the challenge is pretty fair. Though enemy accuracy sometimes feels slightly bu****it.
+ Is pretty spooky.
+ Length is good for 8,99€, and it comes with two expansion packs.

[b] MIXED/NEUTRAL: [/b]
* Will get repetive after you played three hours. The game tries to introduce new things, which include weapons, turrets and Alma's ""friends"", but it's not enough for my taste.
* Old graphics might be a turn-off to some people.
* Though this makes sense for game design, however it doesn't make sense why Alma can instakill someone, but is unable to do that with The Point Man (You)

[b] CONS (BAD): [/b]
- I occasionally think replicas (and specially ATC guards) have unfair accuracy and hearing. They almost always predict where you are even if you barely made any noice by crouch walking. It might offer challenge, but it was something I thought I should mention. This is based on my experience when playing on hard.
- I noticed that sometimes the game changes key bindings itself for weird reasons. I couldn't jump until I changed it back. I don't know why that happens.
- At one point the game takes all of your weapons away, which shouldn't be acceptable in video games. How weapon disappear? Did ghost take them, and if they did, why give pistol to Point Man. Doesn't make any sense.

[b] CONS (AWFUL): [/b]
- Melee strikes end up with unfair deaths. You usually miss for some reason and then enemy takes all of your armor with one or two hits. Just use shotgun or any other weapon and you'll be good. Don't even try stealth, it might work sometimes, but A.I have better ears and eyes than you.

I could've forgot a few details, bad memory you see. If there is anything I could add to my review, please let me know. Lately I've disliked using rating because opinions changed often but if I had to give a rating, it might be 7/10 or 8/10."
76561197992902568,1497176762,True,The game was a huge hit back in the day. remember the gamespy days.
76561198253814583,1496929203,True,"Last time I finished the game and I didn't have time to make a review, so this time i'm gonna make up for it.

Here are + and - for the game:

The +:
+ The story is good.
+ The graphic is good, old but feel classic.
+ The horror and psychological elements are very well executed in the game.
+ The shooting mechanic is pretty basic, with lean systems and slomo will help you survive through the battlefield. (Always stay alert, just in case :)) ).
+ The AI enemies are super smart, always act as a team, they will use everything they can to lure you out of the cover, take a detour to hit you by surprise, or even play hide-and-seek with you...  FOREVER!
+ The difficulties are ok, although it's really tough even in the moderate difficulty, the enemies shoot a couple of hits and POOF, your health bar now is lower than your armor. I didn't have time to play harder difficulties because i didn't have time to play more, but i knew that once i play them, it's gonna be ONE WAY TRIP TO HELL!!

The -:
- There is no boss battle at the end of the game, kind-of-a-bit lacky in a FPS game.
- The subtitle size is WAY too small.

A great experience, make the game is far more superior than other mordern days FPS games. Worth the money for buying this as well as the rest of the series. Awesome game till the end...
+ Score: 9/10."

76561198005974275,1496780606,True,"A flawed gem. The core gameplay loop is fantastic. The combat encounters give you a lot to think about, especially due to the excellent AI. Encounters start and end in an instant, with minimal cues to prelude the battle. Combining that with opponents that flank and ambush you at unexpected and stress-inducing times gives the combat in F.E.A.R. a flow that still holds up, even a decade later. That said, there isn't much else to the game. The combat, while exciting, doesn't really evolve beyond introducing slower enemies with more health or dumb ghosts that charge straight into your line-of-fire. The whole hallucination aspect is weak, as they only exist to serve as a segue between combat segments. Only on rare occaisions do these hallucinations harm the player, and they aren't as impactful with the amount of wandering around you do in the dark looking for ladders that lead to the next ambush.

7 out of 10 the closest we will get to a Max Payne/Half-Life crossover."
76561198081862874,1496780525,True,"F.E.A.R Review – Raymond KT

Summary: Be the hero in your own cinematic epic of action, tension and terror. A mysterious paramilitary force infiltrates a multi-billion dollar aerospace compound, taking hostages but issuing no demands. The government responds by sending in a Special Forces team only to have them obliterated. Live footage of the massacre shows an inexplicable wave of destruction tearing the soldiers apart. With no other recourse, the elite F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) team is assembled to deal with the extraordinary circumstances. They are given one simple mission: Evaluate the threat and eliminate the intruders at any cost. F.E.A.R. Extraction Point Extraction Point kicks off where the original game ended – with a bang. As the helicopter which the F.E.A.R. team is on attempts to leave the vicinity, it instead winds up crashing. The F.E.A.R. team is thus forced to seek out an alternate extraction point, all the way battling the now free Alma and her paranormal minions across a destroyed city. F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate As the first F.E.A.R. team and Delta Force fight for control of the situation, a second F.E.A.R. team is sent in to shed some light on Armacham Technology Corporation's (ATC) dark past. As a member of a secondary F.E.A.R. team, you are brought in to discover more information regarding the secret project at the ATC facilities. The multiplayer component for this expansion is no longer available.

I am generally a fan of survival horror type games, so I was overall excited to play this for the first time. the fantastic graphics, sound, and firefights all blend to make F.E.A.R. an excellent game, though to enjoy the graphics and the game to its fullest, you must have a high-end computer system. In closing, F.E.A.R. is one of the best games I’ve ever played. In the game, as the plot suggests, there are a lot of psychic phenomena you can encounter as you progress. F.E.A.R. is inspired by Japanese horror movies (mainly The Ring.), and it is presented through creepy sound effects and music, and abrupt noises and lights that tend to spook you at times, along with mysterious characters who suddenly walk out in front of you, only to disappear swiftly behind a corner or even right before your eyes. Every now and then, a spine-chilling little girl named Alma appears. At first she just wants to scare you, but later on she shows you her strengths; Alma can mess with peoples heads or even cause them to explode using only her mind. The scarier parts of the game are portrayed effectively, and some players will certainly react to the games eerie atmosphere. You can save the game whenever you want, but there are also plenty of checkpoints where the game is automatically saved. During the games 11 sections, you can collect up to 10 med kits, and use them whenever you need to restore 50 points of your health (from each kit). The in-game weaponry is rather basic, and includes a pistol, a submachine gun, a shotgun, and a rocket launcher. The most appealing gun is the penetrator (also known as the nail gun), which fires high-velocity nails into enemies and can even pin them to walls. You can also kick enemies, as well as punch them or hit them with your rifle butt. You can only carry three weapons at a time, which forces you to choose the best ones for you. Another feature that can help you in the game is called , which is similar to Max Paynes infamous bullet time‚ feature. It basically slows down time for other on-screen characters, allowing you quicker movement than them, which obviously gives you a huge temporary advantage. During Slowmo, you can outwit the enemy A.I., while also taking a few seconds to enjoy the great scenery and explosions that the game engine provides.

After finishing the single-player mode, which is about 10-12 hours long, you can dive straight into the multiplayer part of F.E.A.R., which is also a lot of fun; it supports up to 16 players, in which you can play the regular Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag. The good news is that the players can also use Slow Mo, which is a worthy addition. You can also use the opportunity granted by physically punching, kicking, and pistol-whipping your enemies. The multiplayer component is extremely fast, which means you can kill and be killed in equal amounts. The enemy A.I. in F.E.A.R. is great and, along with the excellent graphics engine and wonderful sound, you can play through many intensely enjoyable combat scenes. Most of the scenery explodes around you when impacted by bullets (like shattering wood, breaking windows, and parts of walls splatter all over), and the sound is certainly complementary to the general feeling of the battle scenes. The games central narrative is a little disappointing, and in no way as good as had been promised; it delivered, as it is, via predictable plot routes like in-game movies, voicemail messages, and laptop downloads. But the fantastic graphics, sound, and firefights all blend to make F.E.A.R. an excellent game, though in order to enjoy the graphics and the game to its fullest, you must have a high-end computer system. In closing, F.E.A.R. is definitely one of the best games out there.

In the soundtrack I noticed one or two faults in the part where a monster appears and only after that it gives the sound.

76561198091854581,1494970302,True," I was yanking my t-shirt by the collar whilst eagerly waiting for this game to be released.. due to.. obvious reasons (Ubisoft has made terrible ports for PC before).

As soon as I played WD2, it felt so god-dang smooth and they really did add a lot of detail into the settings of this game.

If you wanna buy it, I say you should. It's a new game, it's something you're probably interested in and it's not half bad! I'm enjoying myself so much. :') The characters are fun, the invasion modes are fun, co-op is fun (I don't think story co-op is a thing but you can basically explore the map and do mini missions or just hang out there's quite a bit to do though, it is indeed seamless).

Pros:

- Great Audio
- Great Dialogue
- Great gameplay mechanics
- Great animations (those freakin' parkour animations man!)
- Great story (so far)
- Very fun (subjective, but heck, I'm sure the 99% of WD2 consumers would agree!)
- Fast travelling.. MMMMM YES MY BEAUTIFUL FAST TRAVEL FRIEND! <3
- A male black character that DOESN'T get seen as a crook when he walks around, but rather a stud (in the eyes of civillians since they're very friendly 'n stuff!)

CONS:

- There's just ""master volume"" settings for audio? You can't turn down either SFX, Voice or music specifically.. not that I've seen anyway. But heck, I could be blind. Prooooooooobably not though. So yeah, no specific audio volume settings >;c

- Although the world itself is very live (there's a lot going on and it's LIT AF), along with there being a ton of stuff to do; personally I think there's not enough dialogue with the main crew unless you're interacting with an OP or they let you know about a new OP, like no random chats here n there.. but that's just me I guess, to each & their own. Some people would like more dialogue among the crew outside of ops, others might not. This is more of a PERSONAL CON. :~)

76561198107775662,1494454053,True,"This game is defiantly worth playing. Especially the DLC. The story is interesting and the gameplay/shooting is fun and feels very smooth. The game is short but still very enjoyable and the graphics are decent for an older game.

The horror aspect of the game is there. The environments are very eerie and being alone all the time really had me on my toes. Unfortunately the combat with the enemy takes you out of the horror aspect of the game. There are few jump scares. They did not really get me. I only jump scared myself at stupid moments. Like I know I was going to fall through a ceiling, but when I stepped on it I did not initially fall through. I stepped forward a little and then fell through and nearly shit myself. Then Alma randomly came out of a cubical and since there was no sound playing, I did not really notice her. I say her and did not pay any attention. But for some reason I had the most delayed reaction ever, and when I say her move towards me it scared the shit out of me. Alma appears randomly all throughout the game to try and scare you and it’s defiantly creepy, and I like how they did it. They do not try and jump scary but try to get you physiologically by having you think that Alma is always near you.

If you can get this game on sale, its will make up for the short gameplay and the DLC are a bit more scary. Defiantly give this game a try.
"
76561198012461471,1494424809,False,"F.E.A.R. is one of those games, which was 90000% better when you were a child, but now that you've grown up, and so has the gaming industry, it's aged really poorly. 

Fyi, some spoilers (ish, you're really not missing anything)

The story gets worse as the series progressed. Having two timelines because WB sold the rights to vivendi first then monolith produces two different ""cannons"" meaning that what happens in the first game means little anyway. The combat is fun at first but after about an hour it becomes grating to say the least. Given that the only other element is ""story"" the game really just ends up being in a crisis as to what it wants to be.

F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon (this one) is the best of all the games, and you will get some enjoyment out of it, but no matter which expansion/sequel you play after the series just gets dull. You can pick from vivendi's ""Everything you did in this game didn't matter and everyone dies"" which comes in the form of two mediocre ""expansions"". You could also pick  monoliths timeline which starts a bit more promisingly with F.E.A.R. 2,  but then shoots it's own foot off when it kills the protagonist we spent the whole game getting attached to in F.E.A.R. 3. which is a sorry excuse for a game if ever I saw one.

Enviroments are boring to say the least. Once you get past the whole ""decayed urban centre"" you get ""slightly futuristic office"" and then back to a mix of the two. Guns are fairly bland, you get various types of machine gun ranging from pop-gun pew, heavy pew, lots of pew and long range pew. They have names apparently but somehow it really didn't seem important. One thing I did like is that, your starting weapon, the pistol is one of the best weapons throughout the whole game.

Characters are really poorly done, there's very little fleshing out, your own character you only really get any developments much later/at the end of the game. The there's a team mate who goes missing who no one really gives a toss about, some scientists who die, a scientist daughter who dies, evil cannibal guy who dies (and thanks to both cannons annoyingly comes back anyway) , kick-ass black guy who dies in one of the cannons and a hot asian who also dies in one of the cannons. My favourite was the nice asian lady because she hits on you at one point. Overall it doesn't really leave much room for attachments or immersion though. 

The cover mechanics are interesting in the way of you poke your head out you get shot, but that's alright because armour is literally everywhere as well as the same generic medic box, ammunition isn't too much of a problem - rough conservation means you can use your favourite gun 70% of the time, and the slow motion feature is to be honest, boringly repetitive. 

The enemy varies from several types ""grunt"" ""stronger grunt"" ""tough cyborg"" ""mech robot"" ""flying mech robot"" and some nasty ghost fellows. For it's time? Great! Nowadays? piss poor and boring. Not to mention the fact they conveniently shout literally everything they're doing before they do it handly giving you the perfect 3 seconds to jump out and rain bullets on their day. 

This all being said, it's a good game. I remember watching my dad when I was younger playing it and often I'd be sent away because it was that scary. Now I'm older of course, the scary bits are just rather inconveinient. 

The series really needs a reboot. A remake of the first game, and an entirely new set of sequels with a storyline that will actually make me show interest and concern for the characters. It needs to foccus more on immersion and storyline than combat and gameplay. Multiplayer and Co-op kill off almost totally the horror/terror element to the game so that simply needs to stop. Killing off every character within the space of a game also is a pretty big no if you want people to get attached to them or care about your series. The fact that the first game spends almost it's entirety making you scared of the evil cannibal guy and then F.E.A.R. 3 lets you play as him totally kills any vibes it might have had as a horror title.

If I had to describe the whole series and this game in one word it'd just be dull or bland. The most interesting part of the whole F.E.A.R story, is when in F.E.A.R. 2 the main protagonist gets sexually used against his will. And that's purely out of the fact that it's the first time I've seen that conecpt in gaming; that such a thing happens to a guy, and not because it's actually interesting.

I think the biggest let down of all is that the game starts off with a pretty tactical theme, and as it progresses, the whole operational feel just goes to shit, which rather than immerses you, just makes you feel the developers needed an excuse to make the game way too simplistic. Everyone conveiniently seems to die ¬_¬

Tl;DR; dull game, ruined series, too many cannons, and everyone dies before you can care."

Is the game flawless? No, in later sections auto-turrets were introduced, and everytime they popped out the game plays this really loud noise like it's supposed to be the scariest thing in the game. It isn't, it's just annoying."

The AI and graphics stand up to today's standards. I wish there was a sandbox mode like Garry's Mod that would let you create combat scenarios to just enjoy the way the AI fights you. That would be outstanding. Sadly there is not. ALso if you look there are some singeplayer mods to enjoy more missions. ModDB.
76561198004655744,1494294657,True,"Despite the name, F.E.A.R. is not primarily a horror game.  It is a fast paced FPS with horror elements, and its best attributes are not horror related.  What F.E.A.R. does best, and what it does better than any other game I've played to this day, is make shooting people an art.  Seriously.  This is accomplished by a combination of things, namely:

- The best, most advanced AI of any linear action shooter to date.  AI utilizes cover and various teamwork tactics better than in any other shooter, as well as flanking, and their understanding of the environment is great.  RPS has a good writeup on this:

https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/04/03/why-fears-ai-is-still-the-best-in-first-person-shooters/

And here's an even better video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaOLBOuyswI

- Perhaps the best ragdoll physics/animations I have ever seen.  They are not entirely realistic, but are entirely awesome.

- Everything not bolted down is a physics object, and bullets and explosions send them flying.  Great physics, well above average by today's standards (better than most modern shooters). Far fewer physics glitches than modern CryEngine and physics enabled Unity titles.

- More and better quality particle effects demonstrating greater realism than most other shooters (yes, even the vast majority of today's).  From dust to sparks and other debris, bullets send them all flying, bullet decals are most believable and don't just disappear.

- Outstanding sound effects - mostly better than what we get today in 3D spatial sound processing, plus EAX Advanced HD (aka EAX 3) which goes many steps further than what most of today's games attempt with regards to dynamic environmental sound effects (e.g. multiple simultaneous sound environments, more realistic dynamic echoes/reverb).

- Awesome blood and gore, and body physics + blood splatter don't disappear when an NPC dies.  Few games can compete with this game in this regard.

- Cool, unique guns, such as a militarized nail gun that can nail people to walls, a particle rifle that vaporizes enemies leaving behind only a blackened skeleton, a laser cannon, a multi-rocket launcher, and more.  It also has multiple kinds of melee attacks - not just your normal weapon bash but also a slide, bicycle kick, and another aerial kick. This is a testament to the game's greater attention to detail with movement.  Other examples of this include a first person player mesh, more movement sounds than most FPS games bother to include, and leaning which was once a standard in PC games.

- Slow motion of course.  This allows you to shoot down thrown grenades and rockets, and be the ultimate badass.

Notice how Steam's official screenshots all capture shootouts and particles.  This is why.

You see, F.E.A.R. actually utilizes advanced technology (much of which is still advanced and superior by today's standards, like those specified above) to improve gameplay drastically, not just for eye candy.  Compare that to the majority of AAA shooters, in which everything is static and the AI is dumber than a bag of rocks and totally dysfunctional even in the simplest of scenarios... atrocious.  Because of the dynamic nature of F.E.A.R., every shootout can be its own unique experience and its own work of art.

It is both funny and sad how F.E.A.R., a 2005 game, is more technologically advanced in many ways than AAA games coming 10 years later.  Not just the elements listed above, but others such as the number of dynamic lights and dynamic shadows (almost every light source is dynamic and casts dynamic shadows, rare in AAA games even today), reflections, water.  Make sure you download the dynamic flashlight mod, it really adds to the atmosphere.

https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/518-flashlight-shadows-mod/

F.E.A.R.'s storytelling is weak, but hardly anyone will care when playing it because it's not really the point.  This game is about shooting people, blowing them up, and beating them up, and no game does it better.  For this reason, playing F.E.A.R. might make you appreciate all other shooters a bit less... that is, the actual act of shooting people, because F.E.A.R. is so good in this regard.

Extraction Point is the best of F.E.A.R. It is a game sized expansion with even better designed shootouts than the base game and a cooler weapon selection. Perseus Mandate is the weakest link in this bundle, as it is rather boring.

F.E.A.R.'s multiplayer can be downloaded separately for free.

http://fear-community.org/

Also beware of compatibility issues with Logitech peripherals.  If you use a Logitech mouse and/or keyboard, get the mod that fixes performance issues with them.

For those who want more F.E.A.R. and hate the sequels (that describes everyone who played the sequels), play Underhell.  It is a Source mod that only requires Source SDK Base 2007 to be installed, no game required.  It is inspired by F.E.A.R., it is similarly good as a shooter in all respects (AI, ragdolls, blood/gore, and particles are not as good but still very good), but it is a far creepier horror game, it actually has good storytelling, and it is just a better game in every way besides shooting people.

http://www.moddb.com/mods/underhell

Also note that F.E.A.R. is more in need of a remaster than almost all other games. It is unstable - if you can't load a chapter, change resolution to 800 x 600 and try again. Its sound is largely broken in modern Windows 10 and 11 even with DSOAL and IndirectSound. In the base game, I can only enable hardware accelerated sound but no EAX, or else I get no gunshot sounds. Thankfully it all works in Extraction Point... but for how long? Will it work in Windows 11?

Another reason it needs a remaster is its lighting. It uses 100% dynamic lighting, but this was not a smart move for its 2005 lighting system which was worse than that of id Tech 4, Source, and Unreal Engine 2. Because of this, you can have a fully lit room with pitch black spots because the lighting system is so poor that lights barely cover any distance. On top of that, the AI for all its merits is not affected by darkness. It really needs a ray traced remaster."
76561197998793855,1494249481,True,"Yes, it is a first person shooter. No, it isn't that scary, not any longer anyways. I mostly ran through the game without any bigger hiccups or any scares either. Sure, Alma and Fettel pops up here and there, like a jack in the box, but that's about it. Actually, the most surprising thing happening to me was when a soldier spawned right in front of me, out of nowhere. Nothing a gun can take care of though.

Considering the game now is 12 years old, it still holds up really well. Good graphics, great AI, decent but complex story, sounds are good as well. It's a game you probably will enjoy if you want a good (single player) first person shooter.

EDIT: This is after finishing the first expasion pack - Extraction Point. More of the same, more or less.

I thought that F.E.A.R. would be the very same thing for me but it is not. The sad truth is, it was hot shit around the time it was released but by today's standards it's a dull, rather slow-paced FPS which barely stands out due to emphasis on melee and slowmo. 

The story with it's horror aspect is original to say the least but with the 2005 zero-fidelity graphics it just doesn't do the trick anymore.

To cut it some slack, it's not the combat that's dull but the neverending sections of plain walking in the same bloody envirnoment for several iterations so there's some space for that (jump)scare you're not supposed to see coming but you do anyway...

There are a few bugs at higher resolutions when loading a new mission.  It only happens at two points during the game at 1080p 144 fps. When it happens, the game crashes and the settings need to be lowered for a little bit until the buggy area is finished.

I highly recommend this game and think that any FPS fan will love it.  I first played it when I was young and it was really scary.  I'm not sure if that was because I was just a kid or because it was my first time playing it so every scare was a surprise.  Overall, this is a must buy."

This is a really good game, ran just fine and downloaded just fine, now with the game itself, i wasn't a fan of first person shooters until i played this game the controls are comfortable and the story so far has been really good love the horror in it, kinda reminds me of Half-Life and Condemned mixed together (in my opinion anyways). I haven't played the add ons yet but i will once i finish the main story and those to will be great. so long story short its a great game and you should get it you wont be dissapointed :)

F.E.A.R. Extraction Point REVIEW
Great game from start to finish. Isn't as much of a jumpy/thriller FPS as it is a psychological one. It's somewhat fast paced, but also builds up a sense of tension and horror.. as if a little dead girl is following you're every move. A must play!!

F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate REVIEW
This is an excellent addition to the FEAR franchise. If you enjoy FEAR, you will love this episode. I enjoyed this a bit more than Extraction point, I found the action much sharper, the few new weapons fun (the grenade launcher is a little lame though) and the storyline decent.
         It starts out sort of the usual FEAR pace and you might not get pulled in, but by a third of the way in, the pace picks up BIG time! Then it starts to get really really good. There are a couple of new spooky things, and a really awesome abandoned underground city/subway area. The last third is really excellent, with massive firefights, and fierce action compared to the original FEAR game.
         Its too bad that so many people review games without ever playing them. Thats pretty pathetic in my humble opinion. And too many are done by 14 year old adolescents who just parrot others."
76561198018774856,1493257815,True,"Yeah pretty good, nothing spectacular but its a few years old and plays well considering. Not much scariness about it as the levels are somewhat predictable and its more of an Action FPS. I still enjoyed it nonetheless."
76561198272053691,1493193444,True,"Fear really has a knack for great gameplay as the combat and horror is done superbly well. The combat is brilliant, I loved every moment of it. The Slow-mo and variety of weapons makes the game enjoyable and offers replayability as a result. The horror in Fear is also brilliant as the correct use of sound, lighting and a frightening character amplify this aspect as a result. The music is well done and suits the setting of the game and I recommend that this game should be bought.

What's wrong with you?

"
76561197960931103,1493101842,True,"Just finished my playthrough of F.E.A.R and it was a wild ride. Very solid first person shooter elements, game mechanics, AI, music, sound and of course the horror element combine to form an excellent game. 

This game is 12 years old (as of 2017) but has aged very well. I couldn’t imagine playing this back in 2005! F.E.A.R is thick with atmosphere and an overall sense of creepiness. I don’t want to call them jump scares, but the game uses multiple unexpected moments with great timing to get a good jolt out of you. I jumped and shouted several words out loud while playing.

At its core, this is a horror first person shooter. You have multiple guns and grenades to use. Also, there is a time shift mechanic that lets you temporarily slow down everything so you can adjust and take out an entire room of bad guys without getting hit. I initially found myself not using it much, but as the game progresses you rely on it almost all the time. There are 2 types of “collectibles” or stat boosts. Max health increase and longer time shift duration. These are permanent and found in some tighter spaces across the levels. It rewards exploring, which is always nice. 

Ambiance and music are very well done. They add so much to the game and without it, the atmosphere would totally be lost. 

The AI is fantastic and one of the best I’ve seen. Again, for 2005 this is exceptional. Enemies are smart and will find different ways to get to you. They’ll flank you, toss grenades, hide and melee you. It’s done in a natural way and is fairly unpredictable how the AI will act. Using time shift and catching them off guard was something I really enjoyed doing and makes you feel like a badass. 

I didn’t find myself getting into the story, for whatever reason. It just didn’t connect with me. Also, it does feel a bit repetitive and very familiar after the first few levels. Enemy variety is lacking here.

I had to use the “DirectInput FPS Fix 0.2” as noted on PCGamingWiki or else my framerate would tank and go into the low 20’s. Using this fix solved that issue though. I would definitely recommend reading the page on PCGamingWiki about this game. 

[b]Pros[/b]
+60fps
+Creepy atmosphere
+Good scares
+Fantastic AI
+Graphics, sounds/music
+Time-shift mechanic
+Auto and manual quick save/load

[b]Cons[/b]
+Had to use DirectInput FPS Fix
+Story wasn’t too interesting
+Repetitive
+Flashlight drains too quickly
+Only carry 3 weapons

A very well made horror FPS. Even with the main story not being interesting and the repetitiveness, all the other elements of this game make it shine.

There's not a single Map or Gunfight I have forgotten in this game (Yes - I played this Game ten times over but it's unique take on the horror/shooter genre is what made everything more memorable than any shooter I played) and the scares were crafted so well together.

Even though the Characters (except Paxton Fettel and the Iconic horror girl, Alma), wasn't as memorable, but it would've been nice to see more history and depth put into them, but they weren't unnecessary additions to the Game's story nonetheless.

But the one thing I didn't like about this Game, well - In a more Personalised way - is the Truly Horrifying enemies that appear at the Last Level:

Now, it's no Half-Life 2, which came out a year before and was revolutionary at the time, but the graphics aren't terrible and it can still be played on a potato laptop.  I prefer the F.E.A.R. ragdolls though; for a game that boasts its' physics engine, the HL2 combine ragdolls are lackluster.

This is one of those games that will always be remembered as a small masterpiece and is, according to reviews, the only good F.E.A.R. game.  (I haven't played 2 and 3, and I actually haven't finished this one yet, I just wanted to write a review because this game keeps bringing me back in)

[h1]Comments:[/h1]
Okay… first things first. I have played this game multiple times in the past… but never finished the first fear, until now. So I kinda rushed through and didn’t really immerse. But I do remember in the past being quite spooked now and then as the tension and horror aspect is great in this game. This time I mostly got jumped because I simply rushed and didn’t really concentrate that much thus got jumped by enemy ganks.

Anyhow.. It’s one of those “flawed masterpieces” or olden gems in the gaming industry. This game has quite intriguing storytelling alongside with complex indoors level-designs (I say complex, because I got lost multiple times). AI in this game is also quite superb IMO. They talk to each other, react accordingly, player can react to their reactions. Shadows are useful as you actually can see where enemies are coming from or going to. They also bash, fire whilst taking cover, back off, regroup etc... Weaponry is fair enough and fun. I played whole game with nailgun (ammo hacks help) because I really like nailing enemies to the wall. Thus comes into question, the physics. Yes. They are fun. Hanging corpses onto ceiling like rags is just fun.

Music and OST is quite action packed and horror themes are nice and tense. Graphics are, well, simple. They are clear and clean. Wouldn’t say they bad or great. For it’s year game, they seem great to my eye.

Story won’t get into. But like Alma, and have actually finsihed FEAR 2 in the past (will replay soon and make review as well). All I can say in FEAR 2 I like here much more :3.

[h1]DLC comments:[/h1]
Extraction Point - couldn’t get it to widescreen anyhow. Config tricks n stuff did not work. So can’t play this one. Thus no comment.

Perseus Mandate -  Lot of action, some eerie atmosphere. Another side of Alma’s story.. Was more actiony than horror in comparison to first game. They added more “horror action” too…bunch of souls and creatures.

[b]ANYHOW[/b] if you are looking action packed atmosphering indoor action horror with great story, superb AI and fun combat. With some really great horror aspect spooks. Then be sure to check out this franchise (at least first and second game)

Positives
Fun combat with an interesting slow motion twist.

Fluid, smooth gameplay.
Several weapons each with its own playstyle, offering different approaches to combat.
Good expansions.

Negatives
Few enemy types.

Very short.
Much of the base game is bland, repetitive environments.

Additional comments

The expansions don't really add anything new, just more of the game.

The expansions launch seperate from the base game.

Had an issue with the expansions not having the resolution I use, while the base game did.

In FEAR you can roundhouse kick, bicycle kick, slide kick, and punch your enemys to death. The story however (in MY opinon) was dry, theres just not to much to it. The level design is awsome in some cases its strait forward and an others its complex.

-Story isn't for everyone but in my opinion it nicely compliments and explains the horror aspect of the game and why your character is able to kill so many enemies all by himself
-Graphics/Effects are certainly dated by todays standards but they are nothing you will forget in a hurry. Theres nothing like decapitating your enemies with a well placed shotgun blast to the head

Let me tell you, that's exactly what it is.

Video game horror has never been a big deal for me, it always seemed cheesy like an early 80's slasher film. But this game truly does a fantasitic job at setting a tone with its level design, lighting, music and supernatural elements. Addedly, the story is pretty interesting in itself.

The story is awful, the cutscenes are worse and the game is so divided by ""shooty shooty bang bang"" and so much empty pacing between it gets super frustrating because you spend more time navigating empty rooms than actually doing anything at all.

The AI do just about everything right and it leaves you wanting more... but that just never happens. Instead you're given some empty shell of a story and try hard jump scares that weren't even scary in 2005. The only reason this game took off was because of the great use of AI triggers and also because it was one of like 3 ""scary"" games out at the time; doom and resident evil were the other two players.

People that say positive things about this thrive off of nostalgia. That's cool! I do too! But this game is just dreadful. Especially once you've been exposed to more modern shooters.

What a wondeful experience. F.E.A.R. is a FPS shooter with twitch based and somewhat horror based shooting. Still holding up in 2017 even after 12 years on the market, the game allows for sub-linear open levels of play and freedom with shooting gameplay that would rival some of even todays standards. 

You play the game as a nameless soldier called 'Pointman' whose tasked with an ultimate goal of finding the games antagonist 'Paxten Fettel' and his hundreds of telepathically controlled units that he now controls (he went rogue or something.). Along the way, you will encounter the para-normal child 'Alma' who's pretty much there for no other reason than to scare/creep you out it seems. 

There's so much more to the story but I'll keep this spoiler free as possible. The story is fine however the way it is presented throughout using phone messages, laptop computers (against, just voice messages) and very few lines of dialoge from any NPC makes it very.. uneven. If I recall, everything except the beginning and end scenes is played from the eyes of the 'Pointman' in a first person view and certain scripted events can be missed if not in the right place/time.

Gameplay is fantastic. My first playthrough was on Hard, clocking in at 12 hours with pure keyboard/mouse. The core gameplay relys on shooting, scavenging and very little else other than pushing the action key on buttons or messages. There's a couple other sections like turret control and dreams worlds but there just didn't seem enough variety of objectives. 

For what there was, oh man. Obviously, the main aspect is combat. Right off the bat you are introduced to Reflex (I think it's called that?) mode which slows down time and gives you an advantage over your enemies while quickly draining and slowly refilling in the background. This is probably the best looking bullet time looking effect I've seen in any video game title. 

The game focuses heavily on corridor shooting. Very rarely will you be in open areas but it still happens occasionally. One of my gripes with the game is that level design is.. so bland. Recalling my 12 hours after credits I can only seem to remember (truthfully); office buildings, construction sites inside office buildings, a parking garage, abandoned office buildings like places and dream world on fire hallways. And that took me a second to think about. I got the the point of getting lost a few times in the game because I couldn't tell certain rooms from rooms. And there's lot of rooms. 

The game is open linear structured broken into segments/levels. You'll always be exploring and going forward but get lost or a need to rebacktrack and you can actually go return to the beginning of a level. On the way, healthkits, messages, ammo/weapons and health/reflex boosters must all be found. The game is healthpack based and armor based.

Enemy variety was also a disappointment. Without spoiling anything, you will fight; soldiers, turrets, flying robot things, invisible ninja soldiers, ghosts, robots and bigger robots. This sounds like a lot which it is, however 95% of the game is focused of soldier warfare and I do not recall more than 2 types of 'soldier'. The 2nd kind which is only a stronger, recolored and textured 'soldier' is found only on the last 2 chapters. 

What balances this (somewhat) is the fantastic AI. This is truly one of the best enemy intelligences I have seen is a game period, no exaggeration. You rarely take on less that 3 guys at once. They always work and comunicate as squads. They will flank, take cover and make cover, help/drag other comrades to safety .. just amazing work here. No battle will ever function the same and it's not just like they are aimbots or anything (far from it, just good work), they act so realisticly. 

Weapons are varied as well. There's a good amount of them if you go by situational standards. Dual pistols, shotgun, smg, assault rifle, battle rifle, rocket launcer and a few others I won't spoil but they are pretty cool and unique thereselves. Each gun looks and sounds amazing and each one has a specific role. Considering the Pointman can only carry 3 weapons of his choice at one time, they must be chosed wisely. Ammo is sort of scare playing on higher difficulties and I had a chance, or rather, actually had to use each weapon individually throughout the game. 

You also have a few types of explosives and a couple cool looking melee attacks that are easy to perform. 

Effects are beautiful here. Particle effects run wild with sparks bounding and flying across the environments. Smoke will fill up small corridors (literally), blood sprays and enemies lose limbs (or just explode!) in mists, fire blurs the screen from it's heat and every bit of this looks so much better in Reflex mode. The graphics hold up quite well here. Textures are still reasonable. The lighting effects manage to provide a believable atmosphere and you will be getting used to the dark. It just gets rather old seeing the same bland office buildings over and over and over. 

Performance wise, the game ran rather smoothly after using the 'Logitech Mouse/Keyboard fix' I found on Google. I played on Max settings, no FXAA and Soft Shadows OFF. I recieved perfect limited 60FPS on a AMD12 6Gig ram and an integrated card Laptop. The requirements are not high at all and any computer newer than 5 years old should be able to run it smoothly.  

In all, F.E.A.R. is an amazing title that has survived (so far!) the test of 12 years and holds up rather well. Gameplay wise, Monolith had everything going for this game that just suffers from drab level design and lacking story that tries to be told but best left to Wikipedia after the credits. Still the coolest slow motion of any game and best AI I've yet to find, I paid $9.99US Dollars for F.E.A.R. and both it's expansion I have yet to try. Well worth my money."

76561198041148162,1489892961,True, The Best F.E.A.R Game In The Series Along With Its Addon's Extraction Point And Perseus Mandate  I Highly Recommend These Games Dont Worry About 2 reborn or 3 They Dont Even Come Close To How GOod These Games are the ai isnt predictable like in 2 3 these ones try to flank you at every point interesting ai sadly they dont make it like they used to anyways bassicly what im saying is only these 3 games should exist 2 recborn and 3 shouldnt have been made there the biggest pile of shits im so dissappointed in the sequals there suppossed to be better but instead they  dumbed down the ai so there very predictable and you can count off where there gonna go the horror isnt in the others like the classic's they just wernt trying hard enough old monolith did these games good sadly there not like this anymore its such a big shame the maps in the classic sometimes repedative but they get the job done they get the combat and the gunfights just right i bought this way before it came out on steam i got the directors cut god such a long time ago that is though

-it has a good amount of content for an fps game of its time (10 hour base + two 5 hour expansions)
-it's cheap as balls (I've seen it at 2.50 alot)
-it's cool as shit (stuff flying everywhere in slow motion)
-great ai
-cool setting

Buy this game if you havent already, its really damn good"
76561197989236581,1489806050,True,"I never cared much for F.E.A.R. . All I knew about it was that it had the The Ring girl and you could slow time like The Matrix, and those two things never really interested me anyways since they just seemed like gimmicks that were cashing in on what was popular at the time.
So it came quite as a shock that I managed to find one of the best FPS games I have ever played here. Preconceptions can be deceiving so it seems, who knew?

For a game released all the way back in 2005, im amazed at how well it holds up today in the technical department. The physics and particle effects are some of the best I have ever seen in a shooter, and the way they increase the positive feedback from the gameplay is great and ultimately what makes the game.
And the slowing down mechanic only enhances it. Entering a room and dispatching every single enemy in the span of 5 seconds and bringing the game back to normal speed never gets old. The room will be filled with blood, bullet holes, lights swinging back and forth and smoke all over the place, giving you this immense feeling of satisfaction and empowerment.
 Its also great that the enemies have really good AI and will constantly try to flank  get the drop on you, and the game has a way of tricking you into believing they act like humans by having them have conversations between squads in relation to your actions. Most of that dialogue is simply a way of disguising the AI, since the enemies actions never really matches what they are saying, but it goes a long way to immerse you into the game and increase your suspension of disbelief.
The weapons are also fantastic, they all have this absurd kick to them that makes killing the enemies incredibly rewarding, and it only gets better as the game progresses, giving you even more ridiculous overpowered guns that will either desintegrate or explode your enemies. Enemies react very realistic to being shot, and by slowing down time you can really see how a bullet hitting on their shoulder, for example, makes them move as you would expect them to.
It never got old unloading a shotgun at point blank on an enemy face with time slowed down.
You would think the slowing down time mechanic would make you feel overpowered, but the game balances that well by making you die very easily if not behind cover and in normal time. So the combat loop of this game ends up making you feel like a monster just annihilating everyone before they can even react and leaving a trail of destruction behind you. 
 
To complement this amazing gameplay, you also have the brilliant level design. You will spend most of your time moving through builidings, offices and factories, and while those environments may seem a bit boring, they are completely elevated by the qualitiy of their routes.
You see, there is always more than one way of approaching a combat segment, the levels tend to be circular, where there is always at least two paths leading to the same spot. This not only provides some really fun moments of hide and sek between you and the enemies, but it also always leaves you a bit tense turning your back to a spot that might just have an enemy trying to get the drop on you.
If there is something FPSs should take from F.E.A.R., its the level design, just some of the best I have seen in a long time.

The presentation is also fantastic. The pace of the game is broken up by horror segments, where you you will have to move through dark corridors and empty building structures. This is all elevated by the lighting system of the game that still holds up, creating some really great shadows, and the realistic environments only enhance the uneasyness.
As for the horror itself, I have to say I found it more endearing than scary, but this is mainly due to the time the game was released, since most of its tricks are cliche by now. But they are good tricks, dont get me wrong and I did have fun getting startled by some of them, its just that they are really tame by today's standards. One thing I have to commend the game, is that the jump scares dont have the obnoxious high pitch sound meant to make you jump so I appreciate that.
Hilariously, I found myself getting more spooked with combat situations that would either surprise me by introducing a new type of threat or by the creative way the enemies would approach me.

The soundtrack is great, having that Half Life feel where it kicks into high gear when the moment calls for it, turning certain situations into a scene straight out of an action movie.

The story itself while managing to get you invested is very by the numbers and the game has a way of trying to make a big deal out of what I think is a very straightforward plot, and some of its twists and revelations were a bit eye rolling inducing, but it was all in good fun and it was never intrusive.Its understandable, being a game of 2005. 

My biggest gripe with the game however has to be the way it decides to end the game. You would expect that the last moments of a visceral FPS like this would be to throw everything and the kitchen sink at you, bringing every enemy type at the same time and giving you every weapon you could carry to give you one last final showdown. 
But nope, the last two chapters are dedicated to the horror component, having you just follow some hallways killing some weird paranormal ghosts that cause minimal damage to you, just so the plot can be served to you.
It really left a bad taste in my mouth, and it was a severe case of blue balls.

Final veridict, play this game. It deserves more love than it gets, this is one of great FPS games of its time, and I think alot of devs would benefit from taking a look at how a shooter is fucking done."

Where the fun comes from really are the gameplay and the bloody-dark ambiance.

+The physics engine. (Havok) I think every single small and middle-sized object can move. 
+The AI is good.
+Nearly perfect audio.
+A bunch of memorable moments.

10/10 for it's time, PLEASE make more!"
76561197995438366,1489293517,False,"I don't remember what did I think about this game when it first came out, but in 2017 it looks, feels and plays like an outdated tech demo.

Everything is dark (literally almost pitch black - you have to use your flashlight all the time, which is annoying, because it needs to be recharged after a minute or so), repetitive and boring. Occasionally the game manages to be exciting, usually in the moment when you're shooting at someone. As soon as they are dead, it's the same boring crap again. Seriously Monolith, the game came out a year after Half-Life 2, and your idea of a FPS is a guy shooting up people in an office building for 4 bloody hours?

Not to mention the wonderfully paced narrative, which literally consists of your superior finding and losing the position of a certain bad guy about 11 times."

76561198255095386,1488658152,True,"F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon), is the masterpiece by Sierra Entertainment, and Monolith Productions. For me it's the best video game  of all time. Grabbed this version on Steam last January and having fun with it since. Even after completing the game numerous times , I can always do something in it, for example complete the game without slow-motion or only using two pistols and grenades..the enemy AI is very challenging, you gotta be on your guard all the time. The melee combat is also fantastic.10/10  Just a quick update after F.E.A.R Complete Pack, in my opinion, the non-canon expansion packs for the first game are way better than the canon continuation of the franchise, F.E.A.R. 2 is mediocre at best, while F.E.A.R 3 ( or  styled as F.3.A.R)  is a complete disaster. Get the first game somewhere else , you'll be better off without the rest of the games ."
76561198033835837,1488500801,False,"As with most old PC games - where they've been re-released to modern systems through digital retailers without receiving any optimisation - I had to go through the motions of setting compatibility modes and downloading third-party patches before the game would launch. Once I had made the achievement of reaching the main screen I had to reset almost all of the keybindings, as they just weren't up to standard.

At first I noticed that F.E.A.R. really shows its age: the animations are quite wooden, especially with the main player's arms (seriously, this is something on-screen for the entirety of the game and they're as stiff as planks). The UI scaling is completely out of whack for larger resolutions, I can barely read the subtitles. It's like trying to read an 8pt font on a 50 inch monitor.

I know this is common in FPS games but having the camera located in the player's chest makes me feel a little like like Tom Cruise on the set of his next major blockbuster. I believe this has also caused problems during firefights as enemies will aim at my head, and be able to hit me while I'm crouched, even though it appears that I'm behind cover. This issue persists through the ages, even appearing in games such as PAYDAY 2.

I'm uncertain as to what technicality is causing frame-rate issues while enabling slo-mo but activating v-sync in the graphic options has improved this greatly. I can now use slo-mo without the screen stuttering like crazy. There are still a number of issues, such as the camera flying through geometry during short cut-scenes. There was also one instance where enemies were able to shoot through walls from across the map, luckily this was a once-off occurrence.

The physics engine is great, it's extremely satisfying to blast enemies and see their ragdolled bodies flying through the air, especially in slow motion. The only problem with this is that the physics is applied to so many environmental objects that I feel is unnecessary, such as cans and general rubbish, which can sometimes cause these objects to spasm violently when they're stepped on by the player.

Whilst the graphics of F.E.A.R. don't particularly hold up, the game is over 10 years old as of writing, I found that the lighting and physics are still something to be admired. Even modern games still can't achieve this level of quality. Enemy spawn positions can be odd at times, where a number of soldiers will spawn right in front of my eyes on a single point. Despite the oddity it became convenient since a single, well-placed shotgun blast can take out 2-3 at once.

Everything, from the physics, the silent protagonist, and the level and sound design - especially of the enemies when they communicate - all remind me heavily of Half-Life 2 but I found that the A.I. in F.E.A.R. is much more intelligent and unpredictable. They would often outflank me, draw me into a bottleneck, and manoeuvre in such a way that I'd end up missing them only to end up dead. There are also certain special enemies that remind me of BioShock's splicers and Big Daddy's, although their appearances are short-lived.

Even though I love linear games I found F.E.A.R. to be far too linear, it's a straight up corridor shooter without much flavour. I also found the game to be very, very dark. I'd often run into walls or closed doors when my flashlight had run out of power.

There is a poor amount of variety when it comes to weapons and an even smaller pool of ammunition to go with them. I would often end up running out of ammo for my preferred weapon (pistol) very quickly. For some reason there is a seemingly unlimited amount of ammunition for the shotgun so I mostly relied on that when my other guns ran dry. I don't particularly appreciate there being a limit on having only three weapons at a time when there is already such a small variety of guns to choose from, I don't see why I can't just hold all of them for the sake of convenience. It's the same with the torch, why allow it to run flat if its recharge time is only a matter of seconds. I found these mechanics to be quite silly and limiting when their implementation was obviously to create some artificial difficulty and basic resource management system. It's a nuisance.

There isn't much to say for the sound design and soundtrack, it's all very ambient and atmospheric.

As for gameplay, it feels like I'm performing the same task over and over again... I'll enter an area, there will be a security lock-down happening, I'll be given the task to deactivate the security system and/or traps and then progress to next area... to be met by further security systems that must be deactivated in order to raise some gates, or activate elevators. To break up this monotony I'll be rewarded by either discovering a civilian or by being reunited with my team. All this progress I've made is soon wiped clean as I take two steps back and have to make up all that lost progress by scaling elevator shafts or taking back alleys. If I'm lucky I'll be extracted by another helicopter. The budget for disposable helicopters must be immense as each chopper somehow manages find itself in compromising situations and soon destroyed. As well as my soldier buddies always seeming to be sidetracked or incapacitated so that I'm forced to take the role as a one-man-army of the hour type hero. It starts becoming a little bit ridiculous and annoying, story-wise.

I do wish there was more focus on the supernatural elements and cut-scenes as they were very sparse, and the small amounts of interesting encounters that did happen weren't enough to break up the monotonous pacing of the story and gameplay. I found the slo-mo system to be a huge crutch for me, without it I was very easily overwhelmed by enemies. I actually feel like the player takes a higher amount of damage without it.

There was a point where the game's difficulty ramped up excessively where resources, such as med-kits and grenades, became much more scarce. Where before I had been able to hoard 10 med-kits at a time and keep a full supply of explosives, I was soon whittled down to nothing for long lengths and at the same time I was expected to handle hordes of special enemies. It soon became too much for me to bear.

Don't get me wrong, F.E.A.R. is a very atmospheric and nice looking game, especially for its time. It's simply not a very exciting or memorable experience, devoid of personality, so much so that I had to force myself to continue playing. I could no longer suspend my disbelief with all of the immersion breaking issues I came across.

I've resorted to using cheat codes for unlimited ammo and health so that I can experience the story and continue on with the expansions and later sequels."

It has some good moments of tension, and some good horror aspects, the first time you play it, it will give you some scares and an uneasy feeling. 

Graphically looks very nice, it doesn't demand a powerful PC to obtain some good frames per second.

76561198039394097,1488063478,True,"I have not played a huge amount of FEAR yet, but I have done some research and feel I need to make something clear for buyers of this game

This is not a horror-combat game, this is a game where you kill lots and lots of soldiers and every thirty minutes something mildly scary happens and then you go back to killing soldiers for another 30 minutes or so. The only fear in F.E.A.R are badly made, cheap jumpscares that would only ""Terrify"" someone who has never played a horror game before, I mean, if youve ever run away from a wasp, you have experienced more horror than fear offers. 

I am not trying to diss the game here, but I will say that the fear community manages to be more ""Fanatical"" than the mind controlled soldiers that are at the center of this game. I started with fear three, barely a horror game, and was told ""Nah, man, fear 1 is the scary one"" So i tried it.

The honest to god truth is, when this game came out, it probably was pretty scary to those who played it, especially as kids. The honest to god truth is that this original fear game will at best make you jump one time. Even the few jumpscares are badly made, and can be seen coming from around corners, as in, you see the static monster or person and then shoot at it, nothing happens, you realize its for a cutscene, and have to stroll into its ""Grab range"" to initiate the cutscene. 

At the end of the day, a  fanatical fear fan (Not all are this bad) will tell you the series is super horror, some kind of amazing entity that pulls off horror in ways no other game has. This is complete crap, this is a good first person shooter with a horror themed story, max payne style bullet time (Why is that in a horror game anyway?) and most of the game comprises you moving through tunnels, offices, and ships to find a cutscene thats supposed to be scary then repeat. You will not fight many, if any, monsters. 

Do not buy this game expecting it to live up to its name, it simply does not. Call me desensitized, but even as a kid in 2005 I dont think this would have scared me, and it defenitely doesnt today. 

Again, this is not meant to bash fear, this is meant to cut through all the crap put out by the fanatics that put this rather typical FPS game onto a pedestal along with other horror icons like silent hill, and the simple fact is this game doesnt even hold a candle to great horror games. A good shooter, horror story, and that's the package, end of story. 

Buy for nostalgia, buy for a good shooter, do not buy for killing paranormal monsters or being scared, simply doesnt happen."

76561197981069264,1487443276,True,"After Max Payne combined Hong Kong Action with noir - an odd combo, but one that worked - another developer tried their hand at a Hong Kong Action hybrid. This time with an even stranger genre: horror.  It works, but the spooks are more of the themepark variety. You hallucinate, see some creepy shit, move on. Only on a few occasions are you forced to shoot your gun at something coming towards you, which isn't much of a challenge. But it's nice to have an atmospheric game where you're not crapping your pants because you're being chased by some hellish monster or a damn xenomorph. You're just haunted by a little girl who appears to spook you when you go around corners then vanishes. It's managable for wimps like me. 

It's the slow-mo bullet-time FPS action where the real threat is at, and it's great. A lot has been said about the FEAR AI, which is damn good, always on the move, outflanking you, sometimes sneakily hiding in corners. I just feel that most of the claustrophobic environments, with the exception of some ingeniously designed office spaces that loop in on eachother, don't really bring the most out of the AI. The warehouses and underground secret labs do little to test the AIs on their ability to move their way around to murder you. Looks like most of the budget went to the middle of the game, where you're moving your way up an office skyscraper, featuring the best level design, in terms of gameplay as well as aesthetics. The rest of the levels pale in comparison. 

Still, give this game a shot if you want John Woo mixed with Japanese horror. It's visceral action with great gamefeel, great gore, environmental damage as well as exaggerated physics and particle effects. Still looks pretty good despite being a decade old by now."

The triple A run and gun titles didnt do it for me, and the new DOOM and Shadow Warrior 2 games are too intensive for my shoddy laptop. Little did I know that all I had to do was not look in the new- but the old.

I bought F.E.A.R on sale, knowing some of what I was getting into because of lets plays id watch back in middle school. Oh damn is it good. First few levels slowing down time and popping headshots with a pistol makes you feel like an action star, like John Wick up in this. The scary elements arent...really scary actually. There was one jumpscare that got me but otherwise, the action is where its at. Amazing game. Holds up well."

MUST OWN CLASSIC!"
76561198057382887,1487308406,True,"Fear 1 man oh man 

Pros 
doesn't overstaying its welcome 
plays good
the story is pretty good
locations and design is cool and in a way i found to be exciting and intriguing
good balance of action
good animations for its age
amazing visuals considering its age

cons
windows 7-10 doesn't get all of the games benefits such as the higher quality sound 
crashing may occur *I had 1 crash in 9 hours on windows 10 results may very*
lack of irons sights 
can ruin the experience of fear 2 and 3 because in comparison 2 and 3 are kind of bad

fear 1 extra notes: was a good 9 or so hours and is a worthy buy. The 2 expansions are included by default

Extraction point expansion

pros 
lots of action
continuation of fear 1s story

cons 
framerate shitting the bed on modern hardware
crashing 
disconnected from server error in single player
ini tweaks required to play in resolution higher than 1280x1024
4 hours

extraction point expansion notes: it lacks a lot of polish. If it had the polish it needed I imagine most the cons would be gone. oh and extraction point has a plug/ad for the dell xps 700 model

Perseus Mandate
pros
more story
didn't overstay its welcome
didn't have really any of extraction points problems
bonus missions

cons
those god awful door sounds near the end of the game it sounds like a loud swallowing sound with some kind of distortion 
the little shits that grab the players legs 

Perseus Mandate notes: connects fear 1 and 2 or atleast tries 

overall Fear and its expansions are pretty old and realistically it has gotten a lot of good press over the years which should be proof enough that you might want to play it"
76561198145971467,1487245674,True,"- Very satishfying shooter, 
- It's like Portal 1 meets Resident Evil. 
- No waves of enemies coming at you, just squads of enemies - who behave like a squad.
- Gunfights are intense. There's no running and gunning here. You carefully peak from behind a corner, take out a guard, and change positions.
- The enemy AI is pretty competent and they will try to pin+flank you, or throw grenades to flush you out etc. 
- Graphics hold up.

76561198019136879,1486655556,True,"I did one playthrough, on Extreme (hardest) difficulty. I do not regret time or money spent. The gameplay is good enough to know you can beat it, and the story is good enough to want to finish it.

Some of the mechanics of the game are just stupid and cheap; mainly, enemies can spot you and react really really quickly, and the turrets are apparently god-like death machines that are sometimes harder to kill than the rock-launching mechs. I've been shot by turrets through ""cover,"" which was just the game either failing to recognize the object in front of me or me failing to recognize my actual hit area (which is bigger than you think.)

Basically the turrets are bullshit, and in general there is very little hiding besides behind several corners.

Also the ""leaning"" is pretty much useless, but you can use it in combination with slow-motion to make pretty accurate shots and not get too hurt. Then again, guys can hit you from miles away, so gfl m8.

About halfway through the game, the damage you take also increases dramatically. I thought maybe extreme was too easy, or that I was ""too good"" (lolol what an a**hole), but right around the time starting to fight the [spoiler]ATC guys[/spoiler], I felt a very noticeable change in how much damage I was taking.

The game doesn't seem to ramp up the difficulty as much as it does spike and plateu the damage you take/ the damage it takes to kill baddies. Endgame weapons are fun if a little unvaried in their general effects.

Oh, also, has a gun that shoots nails and is great.
Also has a gun that shoots particle lazers and disinitegrates baddies.

Good game!"

76561197996216580,1486512828,True,"This game comes pretty damn close to perfection. The shooting mechanics are on point, the level design motivates you to search around for powerups and the tidbits of story and the great AI knows just how to use it to your disadvantage.

They also nailed how to do horror. It's not just your usual jumpscares but a constant atmosphere of uncertainty. Since Alma can get you pretty much anywhere, you never know when she's gonna strike next. The memories aren't too bad once they've appeared (fuck that elevator though), but the fact that they might appear at any point keep you on the edge of your seat. The sound design does the rest, very well-made.

And there's also the technical point. The game aged incredibly well, I can still play it without problems to date (I'm doing it right now). And the graphics were pretty good for the time. Certainly nothing I'd call ugly today.﻿"

76561197992123547,1485975857,True,"Hello everybody, Shaun Meyers here to share my thoughts on F.E.A.R by Monolith Productions and Sierra Entertainment. I didn’t receive a copy of this game for review this time around. I purchased a boxed copy and then a digital copy ages ago and I wanted to write this review after completing the game.

FEAR was originally released on PC on October 18, 2005 with Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions arriving on October 31, 2006 (360) and April 24, 2007 (PS3). For today’s review we’re covering the PC release. The game originally released on CD-Roms (The version I own) but a DVD (Director’s Cut) version was later released which included many bonus features including a Dark Horse comic book, a series of Live Action Vignettes, and a Making of FEAR/Developer’s Commentary documentaries.

In the commentary video Producer Chris Hewitt revealed that there was an entire car chase level which they had worked on for 2 months before removing from the game because it didn’t come out right. He also mentions that there were originally 2 villains; Fettel and Conrad Krieg. The two of them were eventually combined into one enemy with Fettel wearing Krieg’s jacket.

There were two expansion packs titled Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate but these were developed by TimeGate Studios and released on October 24, 2006 and November 2007 respectively. There were also two sequels to the game; FEAR 2: Project Origin and FEAR 3. The game also originally released with multiplayer as well but has since been shut down due to Gamespy’s closure in 2012.

Now that our history lesson is over we can begin talking about the game itself!

FEAR is a psychological, horror, first-person shooter that puts you in control of a new member of the First Encounter Assault and Recon unit that specializes in dealing with supernatural threats. Your mission is to locate a man named Paxton Fettel and kill him at any cost. Over the course of the game you’ll travel to various locations around the city in search of Fettel and to uncover what’s going on. Eventually you begin learning about a research program called Project Origin and it’s none too pretty.

One of my favorite parts of this game is easily the gunplay - which is fast, fluid and a ton of fun. Our unnamed hero has the ability to slow down time (which is really just moving faster than people can register) to take down enemies and escape hairy situations. The game features various types of weapons which are based on real world weapons like assault Rifles and shotguns. There’re also some unique weapons too including one that shoots railway spikes and another that fires particle beams. You can also choose to go full on melee if you so choose and you can unleash some pretty devastating punches and kicks.

Another thing I really enjoyed about the game is the enemy AI which is incredibly smart so long as you’re not playing on easy difficulty. Enemies will hide behind cover, work with their teammates and will often try to flank you in order to kill you. They also have superb melee skills and if they get close to you they’ll unleash the hurt. They’ll also try to use grenades to flush you out from cover as well. The game can get pretty intense.

The game’s graphics have held up incredibly well over the years as well. It still has some absolutely gorgeous lighting/shadowing and the particle effects from ricocheting bullets are still incredibly awesome. Bullets leave deep holes in walls which also increases immersion and shows the destructive power of the weapons.  The sound effects hold up pretty well as well and lends to the superb atmosphere. 

The horror elements didn’t work on me simply because I don’t find games scary, but there was a pretty good balance between the horror and action. There was also one section of the game that was lacking in horror elements but the rest of it was quite good.

Overall, FEAR has been an incredibly fun experience and one I gladly recommend if you haven’t played it yet. It’s not a very long game by any means (I beat it in 6 hours) but it has some excellent gunplay, a great balance between horror/action and it’s quite gorgeous to boot.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to watch my video and read my review folks. I’d greatly appreciate if you could give them both a share or like. Also, be sure to subscribe to my channel for future videos!

Happy gaming folks! - Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!"
76561198037920209,1485887613,True,Perfect game for children learning math skills.
76561198194974125,1485859409,True,"Nostalgic, That's all from me"
76561198059400248,1485655406,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of if not the most underrated games I have ever played. The gameplay is similar to Half Life, but twice as fast with an AI 2-3 times as intelligent. To make this game not completely impossible, they added ""Reflex mode"" which is basically a bullet time mode with a limited duration that you can use at any time, and its just badass to say the least. Despite the game coming out in 2005, the game still looks gorgeous, with tons of particle effects, making the act of shooting a shotgun in the face of an enemy awe inspireing. The atmosphere is also terrific, and really sets it apart from other linear FPS.

10/10"
76561198335472240,1485630197,True,"Very fun horror game.  Just a warning, if you have a wireless Logitech mouse or wireless Logitech keyboard, you could possibly get random low frames (FPS).  Its a very common bug that has never been updated."
76561198093485304,1485570726,True,"The orignal one is a gem and one of the best games I've ever played

As regards to the expansion Extraction Point... I was playing it perfectly fine till a bug make my character to carry no gun and he couldn't move at all. I loaded an autosave and I had no gun but my hands as if they carried a shotgun. That ruined the expansion entirely for me.

Damn Steam for not allowing someone to post an individual review for that buggy and shitty expansion."
76561198003316958,1485565519,True,"You know when people say: ""It's a classic, it's great.""?

That's this game. This game is a classic (In a good way.). I played the MP beta years ago, instantly bought a copy, lost my copy, bought it on Steam some 7 years ago, restarted it multiple times through those years but never finished the expansions until just recently and after all those years, this game is STILL absolutely amazing. Way ahead of it's time, gameplay is tight as can be and does not feel like a 12 year old game unlike a lot of other games from the same period. So while it is a classic, it doesn't look or feel like it's very old at all.

[h1]Sound:[/h1]

The sound design in this game especially with EAX enabled is astounding, just astounding.

[h1]Physics, Tech & Other Things:[/h1]

Almost everything in the environment in destructible and physics based including great ragdoll physics and dismemberment/gibbing. The real time dynamic lighting was way ahead of it's time. Even shell casings cast their own shadows, Point Man casts his own shadow and HAS LEGS. Something I WISH more FPS devs would do. After you see your legs in-game, you'll have a hard time going back to games where you're a floating torso. The super simple melee system in this game is amazing too, so are almost all the weapons.

Explosions and certain particles all cast their own dynamic light. This game was also one of the first games to support soft shadows, a technology that smooths shadow edges depending on their distance from the object casting the shadow. All of this from a game that is now almost 12 years old. Monolith was the KING of FPS games. This game also has TONS of high resolution textures, you can make out addresses and stuff on tiny little postal letters with ease. Although they're all just Monolith easter eggs anyways.

[h1]A.I.:[/h1]

A.I. as many others have said, is great. Enemies will rush, flank and flush you out of cover. They will make plans to gank you and their reflexes are top notch. Enemies can be surprised, you can stealth kill by meleeing them if they're unalerted but there are some issues with the AI such as them being TOO quick to draw weapons on you/spot you too easily and being damn near dead silent when walking around, if you do not have EAX enabled that is, with it enabled footsteps are audible but still kind of quiet while yours are ear piercingly loud which will lead to them/you accidentally bumping into you/them A LOT. They'll also fire at you while running away and it's hit and miss if they'll hit you. A single enemy can take you down pretty easily and some enemies are way too good at range, you'll get hit by every shot of their massive spread fire auto assault rifle randomly. The sneaky special mercs are horrible, easily the worst enemy in the game (PM XP Only), harder to kill than any other enemy (Aside from mechs.) and they can take you down in a split second and they're so fast that they'll get right up in your face and take you down to nothing while you stand there not being able to do much, so keep your distance, they also have a wall flip where they throw three grenades at you, this can insta-kill you, as, if you get hit one grenade can and will set off the other two, three grenades are more than enough to kill you even on Moderate difficulty. Enemies can also shoot you through walls/objects sometimes, it's really strange but it happens a bit.

[h1]Story:[/h1]

People say the story sucks, well I say suck it. This game has a great blend of horror, action and sci-fi and manages to keep itself grounded while containing an interesting story that's not over convoluted. While F.E.A.R. 3 tries to explain things, it ends up making a ton of plot holes, the expansions of this game also cause the same problem BUT they could be canon, they aren't though and that was deliberate from Monolith as they had F2 in production and had plans for a third game that was completely different from the one we got since the publisher owned the rights to the game they gave Day One Games the right to do whatever they wanted to do with it. While F.E.A.R. 3 isn't a horrible game, it's a really well done FPS game but the story doesn't follow F1 properly at all. F2 is a direct sequel and it's fun, not as fun as this one, but still really fun and DOES follow Monolith's actual story since it was actually from them.

[h1]Closing Thoughts:[/h1]

The only thing bad I have to say about this game aside from some AI issues is that there are no options for aim holding, ie, holding mouse2 to aim and letting go puts the weapon back to hip fire, don't know if there's a way to mod that in at all either.

All and all, this game is amazing. Absolutely one of my top favorite series and singular games. I'd recommend it to any fan of FPS games. There was so much more that I wanted to say about one of my all time favorite games but Steam has a character limit. I probably literally wrote a small novel, only to have hit the Steam character limit a quarter of the way through pasting it, sadly.

This game also holds special place in my heart for another reason, it was the second game I ever modded without any help, first game was Far Cry. It was always fun messing with the Arch files. ;)"
76561198066952727,1485553750,True,One of the best FPS games. Great single player and a kickass multiplayer. Sadly there aren't official servers anymore but you can find community hosted servers.
76561198031095594,1485383530,True,Fun atmospheric shooter with some creepy spooking goings on. With a A.I. that tricks you into believing this is the best A.I. ever programmed. A long time fave on console/dvd PC and now on digital PC.
76561198017432095,1485316836,True,"An original Masterpiece. 

To clarify; this game is over 10 years old, and the AI perform better than games that came out literally last week

Game mechanics are very satisfying even with the weird gun recoils..
NPC AI is great and refreshing, they hide behind corners, dont go charging at you like scared animal.

It has that wibe of a scary game, but isn't very scary. There are a few jump scares though.

All in all still worth it to have it in your library and play through at least once even so many years after release."

You get the two expansion packs with it automatically, so at around 10 USD not on sale, I think it's a great deal."
76561198026521595,1484904574,True,"easily one of the greatest games of the 2000s, it'll be 12 years old this year (older then the average CS:GO player wow) and yet it still has some of the most satisfying shooting (partially because of the bullet time mechanic) in the entire FPS genre

goes on sale really really often and it runs flawlessly on modern systems at 1080p, there's no reason not to get it imo"

76561198293178548,1483853415,True,The best of the whole series.  The gun fight is the best of them all... the other two series lack the intense gun fight this one has as well as I hate the other parts 2 snd 3 that add percentage and measurement gun fight results at the end.  Part 3 does that and it just turns me off.  The first is the best and has the intensity I have always admired in a game!
76561198087379112,1483823981,True,"F.E.A.R. is an acronym for First Encounter Assault Recon, and you playing for a member of it - a Point Man to be precise, and that's the only thing you know about him. F.E.A.R. specializes on handling combat situations of uncoditional nature - paranormal stuff in other words. Stuff like this must be happening all the time for squad like this to be created. And it seems to be the case, because one day certain cannibal with batallion of special ops on telepatic leash loses himself and starts to wreak havoc taking over Armacham HQ and moving his forces into long abandoned area for unknown reasons. Our mission is to stop the lunatic but it's obvious that everything is not that simple...
Although very well trained and equipped - you are not superman. Player can take roughly same amount of damage as the enemies, and you should use every tool at your disposal - from your gun to your boosted reflexes which appear to you as slow motion - properly to get out of fight alive, and make a difference in the situation. And if you are using your head on top of that you are rewarded greatly by feeling of manhandling enemy and their F.E.A.R.ful chatter about you taking down whole squads of men.
being released in 2005 it still holds up, and not because it's some sort of classic, but because it's a damn good game. It shows it's age - in bad sense in graphic someplaces and in good sense in gamedesign, but it's certainly worth playing for anyone from old time quake veterans to (and especially) spoiled polygon-counting folk.
[b]Pluses[/b]
[list]
[*]Fast paced smart shooter: you have to work fast and take every advantage over your enemy. Take every cover, flank them, approach unnoticed and be wary - because they [b]will[/b] do the same.
[*]Good leveldesign: different situations every minute, you have to be on your toes all the time. If you can forgive game small amount of textures and models you will find it visually pleasing too.
[*]Reactive environment: twenty years ago we thought games of future will have every object simulated individually. But now we see that cinderblock solid and inert levels are fault of bad design, not low computing power. Thankfully it's far from truth here. Mugs and glass shatter,  monitors break, papers  and chairs fly, lockers doors go off the hinges - sometimes you will willingly hold your trigger just for look and feel of it. And firefights turn into symphony because of this.
[*]Smoke and dust: i wanted to add this to previous point but decided to dedicate separate one because of how significant it is. Each piece of concrete that you chip away from wall with bullets leaves cloud of dust behind it and grenades do this much more. This can obstruct your and enemies view very much and forces you to aim carefully and change positions.
[*]Big and interesting arsenal: all guns have unique and pleasing feel to them, and certainly used differently.
[/list]
[b]Minuses[/b]
[list]
[*]Slo-mo: don't get me wrong, it's cool. It just feels more like a cheat. My advice - play without it. It will train you a good bit of tactical thinking and planning ahead.
[*]Melee: although it has all potential to be VERY cool melee system with all stuff you can pull off - roundhouse jumpkicks, bicycle kicks, weapon strikes etc. - it has very limited use because of how painfully slow it is. You are long dead before you could land a strike, or even if you are not - enemy has more than enough time to get away from you. And it's twice painfull because it is one hit kill in most cases. Therefore it has very limited appliance on one enemy type to be exact. And not one you would expect - that one is invunerable to melee altogether.
[*]Story: there are some serious holes and although overall thing is very interesing sometimes you may feel not very invested
[*]AI: despite how smart it is and how interesting it makes challenge, sometimes it can get really irritating. For example, if enemy has explosive weapon he will shoot at you even at point blank distance, which makes them really hard to deal with.
[*]F.E.A.R.: it seems that you are the only one member of it, and presence of other ones is outright laughable. You just can't take those guys on radio seriously.
[*]Horror: It's not scary. Just not. You look at it with interest, but not in fear.

Overall it's a very good game. Play it. They just not making things like this anymore. It's both an interesting and nostalgic trip to the beginning of 2000's when bulky rounded plastic things with small LCD's looked futuristic and very interesting and demanding challenge which will make you feel like real special operator."
76561198090084504,1483761495,True,"The game is amazing. I would recommend the game just on it's combat alone. The soldier's A.I. and weapons are all so good, and it never gets old going into slow-mo and watching their body ragdoll around the room after you kill them. On top of that the game is also just spooky as hell, which makes it even more engaging. The story is also really good as well, and they did an amazing job with the different environments throughout the game."

76561197975458375,1483525255,True,"I remember playing it back in 2005 and it was impressive then, fast forward to 2017 and it still holds up quite well. The AI was always the talking point of the game and this component shame's more modern games of the genre. The story is decent enough with some supernatural elements and the grahics do a decent job considering the game's 12 years old, it does have fantastic lighting and shadow effects though.

Overall the game is a well rounded package that everybody should experience at least once. Recommended."

The weapons are fun to use, killing enemies is satisfying, which ties it all together in a nice bow making for one of the best FPS games I have played. If I were to recommend a game, this would definitely it."
76561198070031764,1483484652,True,"Probably my most favourite first person shooter ever, I havent played a game with better mechanics and thats as novel as this. Never buy fear 2 though because it's awful"
76561198318971624,1483468710,True,"If you're not using the shotgun, you're doing it wrong."
76561198078679059,1483437362,True,"There has to be some appeal to the idea that one person taking out a group of bad guys in style is 'A grade' material for a lot of different kinds of media, whether it be movies or games. The thrill of one highly trained operative taking on the world never gets old, and being in the shoes of one is better. Video games are a perfect way to put the player in the spot and what better way to do this then in F.E.A.R.  

now F.E.A.R is what you get if you combine ""the raid"" with ""the ring"", a beautiful ballet of ass kicking action with themes of the supernatural. It has some good set pieces and level design even if it's linear, the levels are still wide enough for experimentation. But let's get down to the details. 

[u]Gameplay[/u] 
The core gameplay is based on close quarter shooting and the use of your reflexes. The reflexes aspect make the game go into slow motion for making more accurate shots and better judgment in areas around you. The reflexes are really well designed and might I say this, if shooting a guy then grabbing his gun in mid air to shoot at another  guy doesn't appeal to you then you probably should stop reading this. It even lets you see the special effects differently then what you would see without the reflexes, like Explosions warping the area around them. The guns in this game are pretty amazing if not overdone on purpose. It may not make sense that a sub-machine gun with an mp5 mag have 50 rounds and a fire rate the same as a mini-gun but that's the whole point.  Oh yeah and even the way you kill people can be cool as well. Especially the shotgun that shreds people into piecies, and a particle smasher that literally turns enemies into skeletons

[u]artificial intelligence[/u]
I also have to say that the AI are really smart, they give orders to each other during battle and try to get the drop on the player in ways that the player would never guess. They even work with each other to flank and get to better positions to stop the player dead. I played this on hard and if I didn't have reflexes I would have never beaten the game. 

In summary the whole thing is suppose to be a stupid but enjoyable action game that doesn't take itself too seriously, (well maybe the story). Don't think too hard about why a flying kick does more damage than a gunshot to the head, it's all for mechanics sake to make an enjoyable game without ruining it for the story. 

[u]Atmosphere[/u] 
Now if you have been reading this and you read the words ""well maybe the story"" I'll tell you right now that it's interesting, but not amazing. The story goes that you are an operative of F.E.A.R  and have to stop an army of psychedelic cloned soldiers that can communicate telepathically. Avoiding the games obvious moral [spoiler](don't waste money on war)[/spoiler] the game tries to be like bioshock in the twist of the story, but is delivered very poorly. It even tries to do the horror elements but with most twits, (including me) its actually quite hard to scare someone who's behind a monitor especially playing as a guy who can take care of himself in an end of world scenario. But don't ignore the game for the story, do it for the gameplay, that what the developers were trying to do. 

[u]Negatives[/u] 
There is not really much to say about the negatives in this game, Unless you call the mixed feelings of the story negative. Well a couple I could really think of is the characters. In one scene you meet up with a lady operative and one of the nameless F.E.A.R soldiers who's with her and all join up in a room with the ceiling drenched in blood. She wasn't even scared about it, including the git with her and I thought they were literally clones in disguise. But no that was her and it's never brought up again.  

So the character building is bad except for the fat guy wearing a flower shirt and the antagonist. If the story was given to Bioware they would push this under the carpet and make a good story, probably with an option to bone one of the team members.

but the biggest one there is, is that theres no mission select, and take it from me. If you want to replay the missions, [b]save at the beginning of every level[/b], you'll thank me later.

[u]conclusion[/u]
It's a really good first person action game and I could also go on to the music and physics in the game to make more positive remarks but know this. If taking down a team of soldiers with the skill and accuracy of a hopped up cs:go player on adrenaline shots is appealing then go play this. It's cheap, it even has two expansion packs and a lot of hours of content to play and I cannot recommend it enough. If fighting is not your thing and you want a good story or tackle a situation differently, go play deus ex or the old thief series.  

If nothing I said is appealing then go outside because you are clearly someone's who takes to much advice from fox news."

They figured out a perfect way to use the atmosphere to scare you more than Paxton or Alma. Going through air vents and dark tunnels, you instinctively pull out a shotgun, waiting for something to appear, even if it doesn't. The shooter aspect is great too. It introduces ""reflexes"", which allow you to slow time and have a more controlled line of fire. You could go on about the positives of this game, but there are some negatives. The DLC ""Extraction Point"" isn't updated to run well on modern machines like the base game and Perseus Mandate have. It requires you to change the resolution in the game files. The frame rate drops contantly too. But for $2.49 on the steam sale for the game and both DLC, it's a must buy."

The atmosphere is probably the single best thing about this game. F.E.A.R. gets right what 2 and 3 fall short on, which is the execution of horror. You never know if the next corner you turn around is going to have medkits, enemies, or something more sinister. I loved that feeling of uncertainty, and it kept my on my toes the entire time I was playing. I felt legitimate dread a few times while playing this. 

The only bad thing, in my opinion, was the repeating environment. Around a quarter through the game you're thrown into an office building, and that is where the rest of the game takes place. Close quarters combat, complete with creepy airvents and elevator shafts. 

Nothing beats activating the slow-mo feature and busting through a door, slidekicking an enemy to the ground, and having just enough time to shotgun another two straight in the face.

FEAR - a shooter that's positives still hold up really well, and the weak points haven't got worse either.
The game is a suspense / horror FPS where a simple mission about capturing a target turns out to be a chase that ends up uncovering things from a corporate's past, hence building the story.
The FPS parts are nicely done, the weapons feel really good to use, but some diversity would have been better, there are only 8? weapons, and the universally good weapons are available at every pat of the story.  Explosives are awesome in this game, they feel really powerful.
The gameplay and the game itself... feels old  in a way (the game was made in 2005.) While shooting is great, and the story is really interesting from the second half when actually useful informations surface, vast parts of the game could be summed up as running in very similar looking narrow corridors and stairs under flickering lights, shooting clone soldiers, and hope that I'll find the next morsel for the story / a a creepy apparation.  While the game is not really long, there's remarkably small amounts of stuff going on but shooting at enemies, and it can get old - having a really easy last few chapters doesn't really help, either.
It's an outstanding shooter on a room to room level, but as a whole game it's really lacking because of the unimaginative level design. So afterall, I wholeheartedly recommend it for lovers of FPS games who don't care (too much) about pacing and the story, but at the same time if someone wants to play for the story while doing some shooting inbetween, it gets old really soon.
About Expansions in a nutshell:
Neither of them is canon, so FEAR 2 doesn't take them into consideration.
Extraction Point continues the game, having more cinematic elements and scares, but ultimately fails to deliver any conclusion and adds nothing to the story. No new weapons either.
Perseus Mandate: a lot heavier focus on combat than base game IMO, with a few neat additional weapons."

Man, I love F.E.A.R... It is one of those old school FPSs that I miss today and that remind me of my childhood filled with both children-friendly games like Crash Bandicoot and Gex and mature ones like Prince of Persia, System Shock and, of course, F.E.A.R.
Looking at everything you loved being a kid after growing up, you start to notice that everything you admired does have problems (and sometimes severe ones). This game is no exception:

 - [u]Mediocre plot with few memorable characters[/u]
That might be weird to ask for a decent plot in a shooter, but this one would have been much better if the allies had been much more memorable (antagonists are wunderbar though)

- [u]Repetitive surroundings[/u]
I ain't talking about level architecture, but office and labs interior, which starts to get you bored to the end of the game


But this is nothing compared to everything that makes dat gaem rock:

+ [u]Shooting mechanics[/u]
One of the best ones you may find in games which concept was abandoned by game industry (I'm looking at ya, filthy casual who creates demand)
And level design (forgetting about interior) is perfectly made for such mechanic supporting severe close quarters combat

+ [u]Enemy AI[/u]
It is harsh, believable and unforgiving. When did you last experience a game where enemies were trying to flank you, suppress, surround and surprise-buttsecks you without giving you a breather since 2005?

+ [u]Slow-motion[/u]
A great addition which can be turned off if you want a real challenge

+ [u]Physics[/u]
Everything is well-made from bullet traces and particle effects to lighting when a lamp shakes after an explosion

+ [u]Atmosphere[/u]
Even though plot's not as wunderbar as it could be, the paranoid and claustrophobic atmosphere will crawl right under your skin and won't leave you alone till the credits

+Horror Elements: Although extremely light, the horror-themed plot is a great departure from the generic ""americans shooting terrorists"" shooter formula.
+ Brutal Gunplay: Imagine the lobby scene from The Matrix. There's dust everywhere, shells falling all over the floor, massive holes in the walls, sparks, fire... There's also slowmotion. Best part of the game.
+ Nice Graphics: Despite being old, and looking old in a lot of places, most of the game still looks great. Nice lighting, mostly.
+ Artificial Intelligence: The enemies take cover properly, they try to flank you, they are very accurate and if you camp they are very good at throwing grenades. Not the usual dumbarse bots.

- Repetitive Gameplay: Mostly due to lack of combat and level variety. You just shoot people in abandoned buildings. The combat is still fantastic, but repetitive. Be warned.

The biggest challenges come from the level design being awful. So why recommend it? Because it's hilarious. I never got the chance to play FEAR when it was new, or any of its sequels. But now, ten or so years after its release, I finally got my hands on a copy. The AI, weapons, and overall shooter gameplay aren't what make this game fun, although they're all outstanding. Instead it's the disinterested squad leader, who delivers every line like he's annoyed that you're interrupting him while he's reading the newspaper. And he gets the entire contents of laptop hard drives in a few seconds, via a ~2005 wireless internet connection, instantly finds the relevant stuff, and reads a tiny portion of it out of context. There are voice recordings delivered by answering machine messages that usually begin with ""You have a new message from (full name)....*BEEP*..Hello it's (full name)"". The place where the bad guys originated is literally called Origin.... I could go on and on, but that'd spoil the fun. If you're looking for unintentional humor, FEAR is a must-play.

76561197969490129,1480990511,True,"***I WROTE THIS REVIEW IN November of 2005... Found it on my HD and reposted it because I felt it still holds up- hope you enjoy it*

At first glance, F.E.A.R may seem like any other FPS with features that have ""been done"". Well its based on a modified Quake engine, ""can't possibly be any better"".   ""Nothing will be as creepy as Doom"". ""Bullet time, pfft…what is this Max Payne?""  

Sure at first glance F.E.A.R has everything any other FPS has to offer; . F.E.A.R - First Encounter Assault Recon a secret military agency which you can probably guess by its name was assembled to deal with unexplained phenomenon situations. 

It is extremely difficult not to spoil this game by describing the plot outline.  The opening cutscene explains the game’s antagonist, Paxton Fettel loses his mind and takes control of hundreds of military cloned soldiers. (Why are they cloned? I have no idea).   Fettel and his army of cloned soldiers go on a rampage through a small town killing dosens of civilians and seem to be looking for someone or something. Of course it is up to you, the player, to search the city, wipe out the cloned army and stop Fettel.   

The kick to the story is sometimes Fettel will be talking to you from a ghostly apparition.  He will appear suddenly at the end of the hallway, but disappear as soon as you turn the corner; there is also some strange connection between a small child in a red dress, creeping you out by appearing and disappearing in the strangest places while laughter and crying fills your ears.  

The best feature of F.E.A.R is the weapon control and gameplay.  Most FPS have a variety of weapons you can lug around throughout the game but usually do not distinguish recoil, change in ammo or a feel for power and weight.   F.E.A.R's engine allows the player to feel all these features on every weapon. A simple right click on the mouse will allow the player to aim the weapon (much like Call of Duty) and at the same time change the speed of the character to a slow walk, becoming a silence killer. When an assault gun is fired, the recoil is felt, obviously not through the mouse, but on screen; the bullets penetrating plaster walls, wooden boxes, paper, fiberglass, tile ceiling, glass windows creating a cloud of dust and debris right in your face.

Among the series of weapons you can find during the course of the game including several assault weapons, dueling handguns, a nail gun, shotgun, rocket launcher and some sort of laser rifle, all carry very unique firing recoils and bullet wounds effects to your enemy. You cannot keep picking up weapon after weapon and continue your away through the game. F.E.A.R only allows three, including your handguns if you choose to carry them (I don't :)). You also carry along a series of grenades which all seem to come in handy at one point or another. A standard HE grenade, a proximity grenade and a very cool remote grenade.   Use them wisely, they are scarce.  If all these weapons and grenades weren't a lot to choose from, you are given the option of hand to hand combat.   Whether it is the simple melee with your rifle, slide kick, punch or jump kick you can kick the crap out of your enemy instead of riddling them with bullets. However, be prepared to face well armored opponents who will not flinch to a weak kick to the face.   I got a little jump kick happy and found myself falling out of a 50 story building because I thought I was jumping into the next office. Oops.
 
Aside from this enormous improvement in weapon control, F.E.A.R also gives the ability to the player to slow down time. Yes this is a beaten to death feature and can be seen in Max Payne 1 and 2 and The Matrix series, but when you combine the previous feature with slowing down time, you can almost see every single dust particle rendered by your video card.   Also be very prepared when you use the time button and place your shotgun an inch away from your enemy for a giant red cloud of…well you know. 

To go along with bullet time, F.E.A.R carries a great soundtrack with most impressive sound effects. How about hearing every single shell that hits the ground when you're firing your assault rifle while at the same time hearing the bullets pierce your enemy and the wall?   Well that is exactly what you hear… but don't be freaked out by the whispers coming from the dark hallway when your flashlight goes dead and your radio hits a wave of static and your turn around to see a child crawling on the floor towards you.

The AI in F.E.A.R is not bad. Enemies will react to certain situations which I was very impressed with.   If you throw a grenade, one of the enemies will call out. ""Oh shit grenade."" And the team will scatter.  Same situation if an enemy throws a grenade, the rest of the team will prepare for a ""fire in the hole"".   Also if they hear you running down the hall, they will turn towards the sound of your footsteps, but you can just as easily walk in a different direction, sneak up behind them and see them all staring at the original spot they heard you from. 

The cons? Well there isn't much, but one thing is for sure, you better have AT LEAST an X800 to run this game on high.   I've said this before about Doom 3 and HL2, if you're playing these games on low or medium quality; you are not getting much out of these games compared to what you see with a top of the line card, especially if you are turning off shadows. F.E.A.R is a CPU, memory and graphics HOG will truly test your system.

Bottom Line: F.E.A.R is quite easily one of the most unique, freaky, best looking games to date.   With a combination of today's horror qualities most resembling the Ring, graphics that utilize today's best graphics cards and the best use of gameplay in FPS, F.E.A.R will fit in your collection with ease.   I wish the surrounding environment changed more throughout the game like HL2; changing the time of day, or setting instead of the same warehouse, office building, sewer maps that even still look the same, but I hardly notice when I'm trying to figure out where those whispers are coming from."

76561197977982294,1480964583,True,"A totally must have for all FPP/S fans, even when now multiplayer is officially unsupported (it is using mods). I really recommend this game.
Although graphic as for now days standard isn't mint, and some locations may look a bit empty, graphic still looks good. Some of textures like Player or NPCs may looks bad so for better experience I recommend to increase resolution even that exceeds your monitor screen resolutions (ex. Nvidia DSR option).
As for other things this game is pure awesome. Mechanic are like how they should be, AI, even as standard, is good enough. There are lot of places that AI can easily overrun or flank player. Recommend it with mods, that even increase the experience. Cool firing effects, plus slow-mo, plus gory (again better with mods). 
All from above makes the game very cool to play even now. I honestly prefer real shooters, but this is one I like so much it doesn't matter. It is so satisfying. For those who haven't played before and like hardcore FPP games is just a must have."

76561197970538611,1480738245,True,"FEAR is like the Breaking Bad of first person shooters. Yeah, it's great. Now shut the hell up about it. Gamers seem to forget that the title was lambasted upon release for its repetitive environments... but only by journalists. Yes, contrarian clickbaiting-- posting negative reviews to appear edgy and increase site traffic-- has been around since AOL, and those rags had some pathetically fanatical followings too. The positive outcome of this is when I finally got around to playing it a year or so later my expectations were low enough that I was very pleasantly surprised. I love horror, and FEAR is a very scary game, a unique fusion of action and terror that somehow manages to mesh perfectly. Not too surprising, seeing as Monolith are legends of the FPS genre, up there with Raven and Id. These are the guys that made Blood, NOLF, Shogo, Condemned and other envelope-pushing titles before gaming was taken over by suits and ties.

So what is FEAR? It's a highly atmospheric shooter with fun guns and a fluidly reactive melee system. It's lauded as having some of the best enemy AI ever, though I've never really noticed because I've usually wiped out everyone in the room before they have a chance to do anything ""artificially intelligent"". This was one of the first (not THE first) shooters to implement slow-mo bullet-time, which you can upgrade throughout the game (along with health) if you have sharp eyes and a knack for exploration. It's highly satisfying, gruesome, and gives you an opportunity to admire the gorgeous particle effects. The campaign segways back and forth throughout its runtime with frantic bouts of action interspersed with sections of unnerving silence and exploration. Many have criticized the story and horror elements as distracting to the action-- ""I just wish the game would stop trying to be scary so I can get back to killing stuff in slo-mo"". These people were probably potential school shooters at some point, so their opinions can safely be discarded.

FEAR has one of the best horror atmospheres ever, if only for it's minimalism. Because the story starts at dusk and carries on deep into the night, and because you are spending most of the time in empty office buildings, abandoned tenements and construction sites, there is a deliciously unnerving silence inundating most of the game. FEAR is actually one of the quietest games I've ever played, which you wouldn't expect-- the combat is over so quickly, the music so restrained, that this is hands down the best ""after-hours"" game I've ever experienced. What I mean is there is a sense of being in a place you're not supposed to be, a place that is a bustling center of human activity during the day, but because it's the middle of the night, and everyone has gone home (or is dead), and all that's left is the dim glow of overhead fluorescent lights and the pitch black corners they fail to illuminate, there is the uneasy sensation of being an invisible trespasser. It creates a potent feeling of loneliness, accentuated by the subtle, throbbing soundtrack, with only the occasional friendly radio update or enemy chit-chat to break the silence. This makes the jump-scares (and they are good jump-scares) all the more effective. Once, a stealthy ATC grunt gave away his position to me because he knocked over a bottle of pills.

The story is also quite minimal, needling it's way into your subconscious through a combination of exposition in the form of radio updates, computer laptops, and answering machines (whose red lights blink invitingly in the darkness) giving you tiny bits of insight into the lives of the people who use them. There are also some very creepy ""hallucinations"" that add to the mystery, and as long as you are paying attention, all the pieces will fall into place by the ending of the game, and what a shocking ending it is.

Oh, and you can LEAN.

There is plenty to nit-pick here, but just to thumb my nose at the wannabe-journalists who knocked the game a decade ago I'll keep it brief. There is a fat, out of place comic-relief character. There is very little on-screen indication of damage, with your HUD being so tiny as to be practically invisible on higher resolutions. This means it's very easy to go from full health to dead before you know who's shooting you or before you can smash the Z key with your pinkie to use a health pack. The OP shotgun is considered one of the best weapons ever by FEAR fans, and it is indeed fun to use, but it's still OP. Pointman only has to rack three shells in a row to reload the 12 round chamber. Also, you can carry, like, a gajillion shells, which makes no sense. (I prefer the dual pistols myself.) Some of the reload animations and weapon models are a little lazy. There is a very annoying ""drone"" enemy that thankfully only makes two appearances in the entire game. Also, for all the love the melee system gets, I only found myself using it maybe half a dozen times throughout my last play through. It's just easier to blow everyone away. Which is fine, to each their own, but don't go off criticizing the sequels for not replicating the system to a fault just because the developers wanted more shooting and less fighting.

A definite must for shooter and horror fans. The sequels are good too, but none of them ever did it quite like FEAR."

The other aspects of the game such as the AI, gunplay, arsenal, and overall game design are not only fantastic, but are better than many modern competitors.  Also, while not the most important aspect of the game, it does an effective job of being a horror game.  It has a few jump scares, but a lot of the horror also comes from a disturbing and ominous atmosphere.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys FPS games."

A fast paced first person shooter born from the ashes of FPS which required the fast-perfect reflexes that Aim assist and bullet magnetism removed from games which required true skill, wit, and endurance to push through hour after hour of heavy combat and heart pounding terror that pulls you deeper into its clutches. It truly is a game to be the end of an era and the beginning of an unrelenting dawn of F.E.A.R. and games which sparked a movement leading to games such as Dead Space and Amnesia. Tread lightly... and save your bullets."

So if you don’t mind 2005 graphics and like FPS with atmosphere this game is for you.

You do have to do some tweaking to fix the FPS drop it gets after 20mins and well the Multiplayer is dead.  But with some googling you can get the stuff you need to fix the FPS drop.  And the Multiplayer was pretty meh anyways.  But still the single player is worth the $10, however I suggest waiting for the F.E.A.R. collection to go on sale so you can save and get the entire F.E.A.R. series cheap.  Its worth it because even though the 3rd one isnt to scary you still get it at a discount price plus you get the 1st and 2nd one cheap too.

76561197992913113,1480064859,True,"Everything about this game is fantastic. From pinning baddies to walls with a nailgun, to trying and failing to anticipate the next scary scene."
76561198043784900,1480054528,True,"The F.E.A.R. series is an oxymoronic franchise of both action-horror and old-school FPS elements. It's derivative from both genres, yet it maintains its uniqueness with its subversions.

It’s generic environments, modern-FPS gunplay, odd design decisions for exposition and limited variety of enemies overshadows the greatness of the subtly of its writing, the high-intense atmosphere, the complex AI and the paranormal elements that make F.E.A.R. distinct. Even when it comes to the gameplay, the series has been torn between the disempowering nature of fear as well as the catharsis of the tension from its high-risk/high-reward combat.

In 2016, the horror elements have not withstood the test of time; the gunplay and difficulty surpasses many games made today that it will baffle you how we are behind the times for AI. In many ways, like other FPS classics such as DOOM or Quake, F.E.A.R is a milestone for the genre that has yet to be understood by the creators/publishers themselves for why it is such a classic.

[h1]T.E.N.S.I.O.N., not F.E.A.R.[/h1]

If any game could warrant from a name-change, F.E.A.R. is the highest on my list. The paranormal elements of enemies, hallucinations, the Alma encounters, the scientific rationale for tampering with psychiatric forces beyond their control all warrant the name it is given. (In many ways, the generic abbreviation fits the game’s confusing mix-mash of ideas.) The horror elements are the focus of the game as well as its story, and none of this is to say that on first playthroughs the experience is not intimidating to your senses.

However, the game’s sense of building tension far outweighs any horror it can instill in you no matter how much you are FPS-Bullet-time-Jesus. From the ambush encounters of invisible enemies, squads that will flank you or employ tactics to get around your defenses, and the paranormal appearances with the atmospheric music all keep your nerves on edge. F.E.A.R. excels in this manner because the core gameplay–the combat–emphasizes that the tension is what will get you killed, not the scares. 

The combat itself uses acceptable, if somewhat barebones, gunplay compared to the customizable, experience grind you will find in modern FPS (even old-school inspired ones). Resource management, of ammo, of guns (which you can hold three), of grenades and of medkits harken back to the design philosophy of DOOM-like games where resource management and mastering level-design are the key skills you must master. F.E.A.R., however, doesn’t stop there with this idea as its most marketed, iconic gameplay mechanic is perhaps one more resource to manage as your arsenal, bullet-time mode.

Bullet-time mode is not unique to F.E.A.R.; it’s how it is used that makes it more effective than a mere gimmick found in other games. Until I had played the game recently, I always wondered why bullet-time mode was such an integral part to the experience. In many franchises, bullet-time is a gimmick staple in FPSs that is only there because it’s a cliché.  F.E.A.R., however, offers another reason for its inclusion that adheres to the similar idea of old-school FPSs: Resource management.

In many ways, playing the game without the reflex boost makes the game more difficult than the game was ever meant to be. That’s because bullet-time is another resource meter that offers an illusion of difficulty similar to games like Max Payne. Bullet-time is not just an offensive tool for combat efficiency but a defensive requirement as well; you use it to evade attacks, take out enemies in numbers beyond your normal means of control—and it’s a convenient way to offer the illusion of overcoming difficulty for both console and PC gamers with more time to react and aim your shots while reenacting your favorite John Woo fantasy. 

This system would feel shallow and worthless had not the AI nor the high damage output warrant its inclusion. Enemies, rather than being class-specific, change their tactics based on the situation—a normal soldier could flank you while you are distracted, another could become a grenadier or they will fall back to regroup with a greater opposition. The banter, reactions and complexities of their AI system rivals most games made within the last decade since its release. The AI emphasizes that you play more smartly with your godlike abilities while the frailty of your character exercises caution. Use your bullet-time unwisely and you’ll quickly find yourself dead; use it efficiently and you can explode a grenade mid-flight to take out a squad. The added melee and momentum options for attacks/dodges combines all these individually excellent elements of F.E.A.R.’s combat system into one of the most entertaining FPSs you will find.  

[h1]“You Have One Unread Message…”[/h1]

Now when it comes to the storytelling of F.E.A.R., I find the experience as respectful of your intelligence as much as the combat demands from you being strategic. This isn’t to say that the storyline is original, memorable, or flawless but that the execution goes a long way to respect the player who wants to enjoy the greatest aspects of the game, the gameplay, and then realize all the connections upon each new playthrough.

Most of the exposition is hidden away in conversations, flashbacks/paranormal experiences, as well as seemingly irrelevant details tucked into voice-mails or laptops. (These laptops with super confidential data of immoral practices from corporations are lying around for anyone to discover at the facilities.) While the presentation of this important information is subpar to other games that use the same ideas, it’s the gradual coming all together of details, characters and motives that really establishes the darkest of themes touched on in this game and in future sequels. 

It wouldn’t be until F.E.A.R. 2 that the squad would get some semblance of personality and add details about the corporation of Armacham; F.E.A.R. 3 would try, and fail, at establishing some personal motivation and character for Pointman (yes, that is his name as far as you know). The expansions for F.E.A.R., amusingly, foreshadow an understanding too late for the franchise now that the F.E.A.R “trilogy” should have died with the end of Extraction Point where the REAL ending of the series ends as far as the horror elements are concerned.

Looking back at the “trilogy” and the official trilogy, Perseus Mandate exemplifies all the future blunders that would sink the franchise down into the abyss of F.E.A.R. Online. PM retells the same story about Alma, choosing to focus on the horror elements rather than the elements that made the gameplay tense; PM highlights the same revelations of Project Origin with rarely anything new added; and it is a franchise that lives only by its successful marketing and profits are concerned until it all comes down to be ruptured into ashes. (PM is not bad as Timegate knows their stuff for making good FPSs, but it displays everything that befell the series from here on out as cheap cash-grabs.)

[h1]So… Who You Gonna Call?[/h1]

Even as I write this review, F.E.A.R. is something I would hope warrants a reboot for the franchise where Monolith can return the series to the aspects that made the gameplay great, not the cheap-scares that were marketable. It is a game I can easily recommend, and if you have any interest in the franchise you should play the first game’s “trilogy” as well as the second game (I personally liked it but I can understand why people think it falls short of the original.)

In the end, F.E.A.R. exemplifies all that seems to be lost to modern games, especially in single-player games, where the gameplay is perfectly paced, interesting and the game knows where to end. The only thing that seems to be forgotten is knowing when something should end, stay dead, and something new should be made, not grave-robbing from the same corpse for sequels."
76561198281739309,1480043638,True,Very nice enemy AI. Do not use slow motion :)

76561197990904301,1480033037,True,"One of the best, and still is best game ever created imo.  I hope they someday make a new game but with the original idea instead of what they had with FEAR 2 and 3."
76561198247783850,1480030005,True," Story:
Plot is something that takes the backseat, while it is an interesting story of exploitation and cruelty it starts off way too slow for my liking.


Graphics:
The game still holds up visually today and comes with an enormous amount of settings for those with older/weaker computers. It can still pack quite a punch, but the environments themselves are quite empty and visually repetitive. This was done for AI, which is understandable since the gameplay blows everything out of the water


Gameplay:
F.E.A.R unlike its sequels understands that the core experience lies in its gameplay. Going into slow-mo and blowing a replica's entire existence never gets old. The squads you fight react dynamically, their unpredictability lends to tense moments forcing you to adopt new tactics. This constant cat and mouse caused me to play F.E.A.R and its expansions immediately right after.


Expansions:
I won't go too much into detail, but the expansions add new variety to the gameplay in the form of weapons and enemies. I loved the new content.


Overall:
I recommend this game to any FPS fan!

76561198005986492,1480028771,True,"Without a doubt one of the best shooters of all time. Why? Here are my 5 arguments:

-A.I that is still pretty much the best seen in a fps game, with enemies that react to your avtions, flank, communicate and scale well with difficulty. 
- A story that paces itself well with the gameplay and serve as a support, not a ""cinematic expereince"" that kills off the gunplay
- Graphics that were incredible on release that still hold up well and still has some stuff that few games have (craters in walls after shots, shockwaves in slowmotions and martial arts moves)
- Incredibly tight and satisfying gunplay with some truly great weapons, the penetrator probably being the most memorable one. 
- Last but not least, the horror element. How many shooters actually offer good gunplay AND actually scary sequences? The terror in FEAR is born both out of hallucinations, jump-scares and a general sense of dread."

76561198044293177,1480019871,True,I love it.One of the best FPS game I ever played.They don't make games like this anymore.If you haven't played it yet trust me you missing out on ton of balls to the wall action and some well scripted spooky moments because game has horror atmosphere.It's like John Woo films (Hard boiled mostly) meets asian horror films (like Grudge).

76561197998897270,1480010034,True,Classic Horror Shooter which I have played through plenty of times (lost the count put almost over 10 times) I know the game as I know my own pockets.. still I return to this game every year for one playthrough because I just want to get into the same mood and blast my way through hundreds of soldier clones. Just can't get enough! One of my favourite shooter ever! 10/10!
76561197997530228,1480006986,True,"FEAR is a weird time capsule. It's simultaneously both a Half-Life school, story driven immersive FPS with outstanding tech for the time and an old school revival, balls out action game in the vein of Painkiller and Serious Sam. Throw in John Woo/Matrix fetishism, Tom Clancy tacticool special ops and horror influence from Hellraiser to The Ring and you have the very mid 00's hodgepodge that is First Encounter Assault Recon. 

Despite this weird stew of disparate, often clashing, elements, FEAR manages to stick the landing on the one thing that matters most in an FPS: FEEL. FEAR has just the right weight, just the right impact, just the right sound, to make the combat feel incredible. This is in large part due to the the signiture slow-mo mechanic that allows you to bring time around you to a crawl and pull off some of the baddest shit ever commited to video games. Fucking throwing a grenade, slide kicking a guy onto the ground, shooting the grenade in the face of three other dudes as you tear someone behind you in half with your shotgun. THE SHOTGUN. Perhaps the most satisfying weapon since the BFG 9000. Not just that, though. The dual pistols, the auto rifle that fires giant stakes that pin people to walls, the weird lighting sniper weapon that skeletonizes dudes. Even unarmed you are a beast with flying drop and slide kicks to knock people to their death. 

But this isn't just a cakewalk power fantasy. On normal and higher difficulties you have to plan and you all your resources effectively. FEAR's AI was revolutionary for its time and is still some of the most active and clever out there. Enemies will respond to your flashlight. Suppress and flank you. Retreat and ambush you. Beyond the basic soldiers are spidery assassins that stalk you and heavily armored robots that are genuine threat. While not quite at Silent Hill levels, ammo is relatively limited. You are encouraged to get to know all the weapons out there, as well as get up close and ultilize your melee capabilities.  Scenarios are varied and the level design has a verticality to it, forcing you to examine the environment to find the best route to get around enemy forces and unleash your bullet time death wave. 

Outside the combat is where the game suffers unfortunately. Between combat scenarios are stretches of linear exploration interspersed with exposition via audio logs and radio calls, creepy anomalies and jump scares. Despite the excellent high contrast lighting which still looks very good today, the environments are very bland and repetitive. Mostly offices and industrial areas without any character or real sense of being lived in. The game is definitely at its worst when it tries to get spooky. Again, despite its technical strength, the atmosphere is just lacking. And then they try to get you with the eiree ghost girl popping out of nowhere as you go around a corner, but it really isn't effective because of how cheap it feels and how often they do it. The horror elements just feel out of place in a game whose strength is the exhilaration of the dynamic combat. The narrative tries to tie two halves of the game together with a plot about a shady corporation whose crazy experiment to create super soldiers and psychic super commanders went all Event Horizon, but it ends up just being an excuse and an afterthought. 

Despite this, the core action gameplay is still some of the best of any fast paced shooter, rivaling DOOM (both 1993 and 2016)."

-Amazing atmosphere and scares
-Good enemy AI

76561198080820703,1479962482,True,"This game holds a special place in memory for me, being the first and quite possibly the only horror video game series (except F3AR) that has made it difficult to continue playing. not because of a sharp difficulty spike or a complex puzzle like most of us will have familiar experiances of in other games... but because it was nerve wrackingly terrifying.

I could write about a hundred of these moments you'll experiance in this game and it's subsequent expansions and how it will absorb you into it's atmosphere, but all i'll say is. NEVER GO INTO THE AIR VENTS EVER AGAIN."
76561198065182497,1479961035,True,"YOU CAN'T DENY THAT THIS IS THE WORLDS MOST WELL MADE HORROR FPS OF WHOLE MILLENIUM

PROs
+ well made synergy of ingame features and level design
+ hostiles with ultimate teamwork and independent tactics (just like grunts and blackops in HL1)
+ story: eastern styled paranormal horror, and western covert-ops and diabolical truth, any questions?
+ immersive atmosphere and characteristic reaction
+ 10+1 years old and still fresh and new

CONs
- much less MOD community than HL1.
- expansions backstabbing vanilla fans: absolutely regressed with EVERYTHING. This is not a joke nor personal opinion. you'll eventually know after realizing that both expension(entire) is rigged with poorly designs arena encounters
- franchise brutally murdered and vandalized (also F.E.A.R. Online, aka. killing blow was by my homeland P2W swines), only vanilla one is the sane and practical purchase choice.

So listen folks, the first one is the best and honestly gaming-industry friendly choice and i hope someday, we reanimate this priceless masterpiece for another, and greater renaissance of ingame creativity."
76561198018672115,1479957815,True,"While the game may now be 11 years old it still holds up incredibly well... at least in the shooting department. While the scares of the game have long since lost their punch the atmosphere of the game is still very creepy and will keep you on edge. The real meat of the game is the shooting and boy if it isn't some of the best shooting ever in a game. Intelligent AI that will actually flank, throw grenades to flush you out of cover and are just generally relentless with their attacks. You however have the infinitely useful ability of SloMo. Not only does it make the firefights look amazing and visceral they are pretty much the only way to fight against the enemies as if you stick to real time you are boned 6 ways from Sunday (unless you're just that good).

Shooting grenades as those clone guys throw them or gibbing enemies into red mist with your trusty VK-12 Combat Shotgun has never been so spectacular. The slow-motion is super cool, the enemy AI is the best I ever seen yet, and the cinematic details make everthing seem bombastic and thrilling. 
It also has a cool atmosphere, when you need some quiet time away from the gunplay. The story and horror is weak, but everything else is top notch. One of my favorites."

9/10"
76561197980238865,1479760298,True,"A very, very solid FPS. While FEAR is known for the cutting-edge graphics it had at the time of release, the years have treated this game well, and it's become only more apparent that this was far more than a simple tech demo game.

FEAR puts you in the boots and balaclava of the Point Man (real name: Poy Yan Timan), recently transferred to FEAR, an organization dedicated to battling the supernatural and upholding overwrought acronyms. You are tasked with taking down a psychic clone commander, and using your abilities to slow down time, are thrown into the fray.

FEAR is a game of claustrophobia, which plays into the horror element, but also to the gunplay itself. And FEAR has some of the best gunplay there is in all of video games. Hands down. Even fourteen years from the time of writing this, FEAR has some of the best gunplay I've ever seen in a video game, and that's saying a lot. The AI in particular is amazing to play against, acting better than a lot of enemy soldiers in video games nowadays. They'll push you if you're weak, throw grenades to flush you out, and flank you when you're weak. It's amazing how fun the enemies are to fight against.

It's also a game of contrasts, and I don't just mean in that in the middle school book report sense. FEAR is a game that punctuates the high-intensity gun battles with moments of quiet, and moments of horror. It's rather amazing how you'll be relieved to hear the chatter of enemy soldiers once you've waded through the spookiness of Alma Wade, the game's resident Japanese ghost girl.

Even the graphics play into this. As I mentioned, this game was fairly famous at the time for having graphics leagues ahead of anything else, and even today it looks pretty good, but that's rather not the point. FEAR is a game of light and dark, and it has a kind of crisp look that makes it instantly recognizable from even a still screenshots, and this is an aspect its sequels simply lack.

FEAR is a game that plays as beautifully as it looks. You honestly feel like an action hero throughout, and that's a feeling that's hard to capture.

It's a no-nonsense fantastic bullet ride all the way through, and a game that can hold its own against nearly any FPS, even today. A classic, and a game the deserves its place among the FPS pantheon alongside Half-Life and Doom."
76561198045785308,1479709801,True,"I'm not necessarily going to give this game a glowing review.  It hasn't exactly aged well and there are a ton of bugs throughout the title ranging from the way enemies' heads extend GMod style when getting hit by a headshot to the weird way landmines occasionally deny the laws of physics and fly skywards crying 'my people need me' in the middle of a combat zone.  But, overall, this was a fairly fun shooter.

The game is advertised as a horror shooter.  Whether it's because I'm desensitized to the point where my soul is layered in titanium or not is up for question, but I've only had a couple of times where I've been uncomfortable or 'scared' of characters or environments.  There is quite a bit of near-future scifi going on though, so I'm willing to forgive it for that (especially the weapons).  However if there's one thing I will take away from this and honestly say that I will miss from this game it's the slowdown mechanic.  Making enemies suddenly talk in deep, slow baritones and watching bullets fly matrix-style towards my face has honestly been fun, however I do feel like that I will have a hard time walking away from this game without expecting similar mechanics in other shooters only to fall flat on my face.  I sincerely hope that this is a mechanic that's kept in the sequels.

Story was intriguing; it wasn't perfect, the ending wasn't as heartbreaking as it could have been, but it was fun overall.  I especially enjoyed the character Mapes.  Watching his fat bulk try to shift through a vent made my day.  I will give that game a 7/10."

FEAR is a very fun FPS game. This is mostly due to reflex time (slow motion). Without it i doubt the game would be as good.
There is also the creepy atmosphere that keeps it interesting, although not creepy enough.

The gameplay is where this game shines.
You are able to hold up to 3 weapons.
There is no button to go into cover, instead you stand or crouch behind walls and objects and can lean out to shoot.
No regenerating health. You can carry 10 health packs. And pick up armor.
No cut scenes, you're always in control of the protagonist
And of course the slow mo.

The game is gory. You can tear enemies apart with bullets. Even blow heads off with shotguns

The story is pretty good, characters are good even though you spend most of your time alone and dont get to interact with them much.

However, the game seems to be more fun and creepier at the beginning.
But afterwards it gets a little repetitive. You fight the same enemies throughout the game.

I wish i didnt spend so much time indoors, and more time outside in the streets.

Sound design is also amazing. Just the sound of walking or climbing or swimming sound so good.
The weapons, especially the shotgun, sound great.
However what this game is missing is a soundtrack. There is no background music to get you pumped up, especially during battle sequences.

One of the best FPS I've played."
76561198043407628,1479288916,True,Ok.
76561197977650266,1479227713,False,Very dull game... looks fine but it is not enough for me to to keep playing this game
76561198028769894,1479178032,True,"For all the ""copycat"" accusations this game has received, it still feels amazing to play by today's standards. The combat is one of the most satisfying things in all of games I've played, and it feels uniqe for this very game. While other games in the series are ok, the first one is absolutely astounding.

There are still not many games where enemies are so responsive to what is going on around them, they will investigate noises and rooms lit by a flashlight, they will count their numbers, be more aggressive when there are more of them, ask for cover, retreat, flank, pin down and even cower in fear when you obliterate almost an entire squad in seconds. To top that, they are a bit tanky, but managable, with great headshot bonuses - given how fast they move, you will have to look for opportunities; like throwing a grenade if they come out of an elevator or a corridor, pop up to nail their heads as soon as they stop pinning you down with fire, or rush in with a shotgun when they scatter.

This combat style makes it an instinctively fair playing field, where player has advantage in powers and wits; and enemies in numbers and additional tactical opportunities. In days of enemies simply running at you and taking cover occasionally, this is like a breath of fresh air.

And while combat is the highlight of this game - another thing is most definitely worth mentioning: sound design.
There are even fewer games where every cracking of the wall, each bullet hit, each shell dropping after short bursts, grenades exploding and even dead bodies dropping, sound like they should do. And that creates an amazing balance, between an absolute chaos during firefights, which flows into the silence as last echoes of shots fade away. 11 years earlier, the graphics of smoke and mess all around were making an even bigger impression, but after so much time, it doesn't look as gorgeous today.

And because of that, a remaster with only high poly models and high resolution textures as changes, would be something great, the proof of how well that game would stand up to current standards. Because even without that, it's easily one of the most fun shooters I had a pleasure to play."
76561198046058213,1479000549,False,2 scary
76561198050412953,1478955059,True,"F.E.A.R is an old classic that is still very playable and fun even to this day.
I've replayed it a couple of times and it's best played on a higher difficulty in my opinion.

Pros [list]
[*] Fun gunplay, the bullets have real weight.
[*] The enviroment is full of bits and bobs that move around so an intense firefight will feel that more awesome because of it.
[*] The sound design is incredible and always make you feel on edge even when there isn't happening anything.
[*] Very advanced AI that flank you, throw large objects around as cover and have a very large vocabulary to always shout and tell eachother where you're hidding or if you're about to shoot or are aiming towards one of their team mates.
[*] The atmosphere is very good in all the various areas you go to throughout the game.
[/list]
Cons [List]
[*] The game isn't very scary, even on my first time playing the game i wasn't ever really scared.
[*] The shooting in slowmotion can sometime feel a little finiky.
[*] The AI are very predictable and you can in certain circumstances force bigger enemies to become stuck making the fights too easy.
[*] The slowmotion makes you about twice as fast as the enemies, this is a little too powerful and does allow you to clear several areas in the game without being hit a single time.
[/List]

As a small disclaimer I never really become scared of any horror game so you might find this game super scary.
Definitely recommend that you pick up F.E.A.R if you're ever looking for an awesome fps."

Yeah, the voice acting might be a bit off, but it's 2005. I can forgive it along with the graphics, which actually hold up suprisingly well.

76561198334625016,1478720967,True,This game is very old but vary goot I think excelent and it's better then many newer firs person shooters and if you like first person shooters and you don't a very goot graphic this is your game.
76561198068182835,1478703806,True,"This game is a fu*king masterpiece! After so many years, the only thing that has aged badly is graphics. Compared to modern standards it is ugly... 

but the game is so much fun that I dont mind it! 

The physics is great fun, the AI is still very good, they flank you they hide and shoot from cover. 

The guns are awesome and you can feel 'the joy' when you kill your enemies with them I personaly love dual pistols, shotgun and... NAIL RIFLE, a rifle that shoots big metal bolts, kind of like wooden stakes for vampires but a bit smaller and metal, and every enemy you kill with it is literaly... nailed to a wall or any other surface behind him and stays that way, which is great as the engine keeps the bodies on map for a very 

long time if you set up the settings to max, so it is awesome when you backtrack to pick up a medkit or different gun and you walk into a room where you had a fierce firefight just a few moments ago and you can see the bodies still nailed in agony where you left them.

And there is bullet time! Yes ladies and gentlment just like Max Payne (but opposite to Max there is an good explanation why our hero has such ability), our hero can slow down time for a short moment which looks and works awesome. You can throw a gernade twoards enemies and turn slowmotion on, and use it to shoot the gernade in air when it flies near your enemies' heads. You will grin with pure satisfaction every time you manage to pull that trick }:->==

there are also 3 types of throwables (in base game, addon adds one more which is a mini turret). First you have a simple gernade which explods when he touches enemy or simply fall to the floor and detonates after a short moment (or you can shoot it mid-air), the second is a bouncing betty-like proximity mine, you throw it on the floor and when enemy walks near it, the mine jumps up about 2 meters highs and blows up straight in the baddies face. The last type of gernade is the sticky gernade with remote detonation. This one is uncomfortable to use as you cannot hold weapon when you select it as you have the detonator in your hands. Basicly you throw a gernade that sticks to any surface it touches, even enemies and it explodes when you use fire button, it is good to set up traps, for example when you run away a bit from the enemy you can stick couple of them the walls and detonate when enemy who follows you will pass them. 

The plot is very nice, it keeps you interested and the horror intrusions are also a nice atmosphere build up. This isnt a horror game as shooting is about 75% of the game but the horror intrusions are still very nice.

The first expansion pack called Extraction Point has a lot more scares and they are much scarier, the atmosphere is much more horror like then the base game, and it adds new enemies and 2 new guns. It is a very good expansion. I liked it very much, it manages to be (despite being identical in gameplay as base game) doing things much better then the original did. The are lot of much more scarier places like Church or metro/underground station and finaly the hospital which is the most scary part of this addon. 

I also like how the addon keep the plot harsh and brutal for the main supporting characters, it will keep you in a very depressed mood but I mean it in a good way (lol). This is not a happy story where you kill all the bad guys and save all your friends, no happy ever after in this one.

I am still playing the second addon campaing (Perseus Mandate) but I like it very much, it has a different main character and shows events that happen alongside those in the main game but dont directly connect with each other, it provides a lot of juicy stuff refering to main game. 

I love when one of your teammates says on radio: 'Hey it seems we have some minors in the building. There is a small girl in red dress... wait where is she? She was just there!'

And the second expansion adds 3 (!) more guns to the game, and also a very good new enemy (a kind of elite forces) which is very difficult to fight so every encounter with them is a great firefight. The first part of the expansion happens during the main game timeline and is mostly heavy on shoting and fighting, although it has it share of scares and horror. The second part that starts just right after the main game ends and the first expansion starts is the where the scary stuff takes leadrship. I played not very much of this second part but enough to see that it is where the horror is taking over. 

One of the best FPP shooters in history. A unique blend of adrenaline rush action with very good AI of enemies and scary horror atmosphere.

76561198024972696,1478561186,False,"Take my review of F.E.A.R with a grain of salt.  I don't like games that make me play in darkness.  At about the half-way point (estimated from walkthroughs), I decided to quit primarily because of that.  However, I also have problems with the ""feel"" of the game:  it feels like I'm a 3rd person in my own game play.  In general, the game treats me as a 3rd party and tells me what to do instead of my being the controlling entity.  And, finally, as a really trivial issue, the f-word density is just too high here.  So, I'm not recommending the game.

That said, if you do decide the game's for you, be aware that if you have Logitech devices, you'll need a fix for the framerate issue:

Enemies are quite boring save for one type, which I'll leave as a surprise. The levels leave a bit to be desired, as none of the locations are particularly interesting. Their layout is intuitive for the most part, however, so they're not too frustrating. I wouldn't say the game is particularly scary.

I'll start with a negative point, since there was only one (for me.)
Although the game didn't take long at all to finish (+/- 5 hours), it really felt like a long time. It's sad to say, but yeah, the game became pretty boring after a while. It's always just you, running around and shooting, getting a briefing, running around and shooting, briefing,... Luckily the paranormal and scary bits were there to spice things up, but the game still stayed a bit repetitive.
On to the positive marks: everything else. The gameplay was fun (with the slow-motion and all that), it looked pretty good (but this comes from a person who's not really interested in graphics), and yeah the story was amazing. It's a must buy for horror fans/fps fans - enjoy the sale while it lasts - and I'm really looking forward to play the other games in the F.E.A.R. series.
(NOTE: although the game makes it look like using the laptops you find is an extra, I really recommend you search for them since you get all the good back story that way.)

(EXTRA NOTE: this review also applies to the two add-ons you get when buying this game (Extraction Point en Perseus Mandate). IMO, they were less scary and the story was waaaaay less immersive, so I don't really recommend them, but if you don't feel like playing them you can just skip straight to F.E.A.R. 2 because the add-ons are non-canon.)"

There are 2 aspects to this game and they somewhat segment themselves. you have the gun play with some pretty smart AI for an old game and then the spooky sections. although the game does seem to lose steam as you chug through esp if you play the DLC's by the time your done it all seems like repetitve shoot these guys pick up these items watch the jumpscare repeat. If you are looking for a good timeless horror game this is more then likely not the one but a decent shooter with some spookey little girls F.E.A.R will be right for you.

A really good game with a decent storyline and some horror elements, including some geniuinely creepy scenes rather than jumpscares. However, there are some tropes that get really irritating and repetitive:
-The American military not only has an infinite supply of helicopters, but they also can't train their pilots to properly protect them. Bottom line: 1,000 helicopters were harmed in the making of this game, and only one of them ever returned to base safely.
-Everybody hates you and does everything in their power to get seperated for you, even if it means dying. Seriously, the Point Man has no friendships that last for more than five minutes.
-The Point Man has never read the old 'In case of emergency, do NOT use the elevators', and as a result, experiences many 'from Floor 20 to -200' moments. Seriosuly dude, they're called stairs. Climb the shaft if you're that damned desperate.

But yeah, great gunplay with a pretty good variety of weapons, fairly decent and challenging squad-based AI, well-crafted atmosphere, some meh puzzle-kinda things and overall an enjoyable experience.
Just don't be surprised when you groan at the sight of elevators, helicopters and anybody who sends you away from the group on an errand that should by all rights require a partner or any kind of backup.

(Oh, and my joke about Johnson and Holiday at the start? If you persue the rest of the F.E.A.R. franchise like you should, you'll see that the entire cast of Halo decided to band together in this series too. [CrazyBirdMan59 is not liable to any disappointment due to exaggerations])"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. 

One Hour Reviews #60 - F.E.A.R.

Just in time for Halloween, I get to play F.E.A.R. for the first time.

As I start the game, it appears I'm playing the role of the nameless, silent protagonist who had just joined the recon team.  I'm briefed about this game named Paxton Fettle that I'm supposed to find.  I'm already a little creeped out as I'm watching a video of this guy snacking on the remains of some security guard.  They've tracked Paxton to some building and the team heads out.

I had to laugh as I first entered the building and I see a rat, who scurries behind a trash can, which suddenly goes flying.  I didn't realize Mighty Mouse lived here.  I didn't laugh anymore after that.  

As I'm going through the building, and suddenly I see some random flash of some bloody face, for like no reason at all.  And now I'm hearing a crying baby, even though I'm pretty sure there's no baby here.  Then a little later, as we're checking out more of the place, suddently my vision goes weird and my partner disappears into black mist.    

At this point I have absolutely no idea what's going on.  And suddenly my partner is back, like nothing has happened.  And he's acting totally normal, so it's like I'm the only one huffing on the crazy gas here.

Still looking for this guy.  I'm off on my own again, and I end up on a roof.  Suddenly I see Paxton, but before I can even react he's knocked me to the ground.  But strangely he says some weird things and runs off.  I guess I wasn't tasty?  With Paxton gone, I head back to my team, and the next thing I know we're on a helicopter ride to our next task.

My squad has changed, as my original team has split up, and now I'm with a squad of expendables.  After we run into a closed gate, I split off to find the gate controls in the nearby warehouse.  I'm taking the time to explore and it pays off as I find a reflex booster, even though I don't quite understand what good it's for.

Natually, once I find the gate controls and open the gate, everything goes to hell.  I hear lots of gunfire so I run back to my squad.  Right as I get back, my vision goes weird again, and I see this creepy little girl, and holy shit she just Kenny Rogers Roasted my entire squad.  My vision clears and I'm looking at their skeletal remains.

This game is seriously messed up.

Now that my squad is toast, now I need to sync back up with my original team again, so I'm off through the gate.  I enter another building and come across a dying man, right before I get into a shootout with a bunch of guys.

It's here that I learn that F.E.A.R. actually has some decent enemy AI.  They know how to take cover, and they like to throw grenades.  I'm hurt pretty bad, and this is when I learn that you only heal up to a 1/4 health without using a medpack.

Also, in the mix of all of this fighting, and after dying, the game gives me a hint about the slow motion.  That's what your reflex is for, if you hit Control, time slows down, and it becomes a lot easier to handle yourself in a gun fight.  I wish I had known about this sooner!  It definitely changes the gameplay as you can slow down time to take out several enemies, and then take cover and let your reflex recharge. 

Now I'm finding myself methodically going through each room in this building, having to painstakingly check every corner carefully.  And I continue to run into pants shitting moments like when a body randomly falls from the ceiling for reasons.  There's lot of little touches as well, like coming across a dead guy next to a phone off the hook, and listening ""we're sorry, your call can't be completed.."" 

At one point, I have to move a shipping crate to unblock a door.  But I also realize I can cross the top of the shipping crate to get from one balcony to another.  Right as I'm halfway over the crate, it's another grey-hair-making moment as I'm suddently getting shot at right as I'm out in the open.

After all that, I hop down through a window and suddently I see creepy Firestarter girl, and this time shes about to roast me.  I turn around and run and next thing I know I am blown through a window and knocked out, until I'm found by my team again.  And that was my first hour of F.E.A.R. 

Looking back, I thought about this voicemail I ran across while I was inside the building.

""Yeah, this is Chet in accounting. Nobody seems to know what's going on, but we've been hearing a lot of loud noises..."" 

Yeah Chet, I don't have any idea what's going on either.  But I'm going to need some new pants."
76561198053306836,1477128002,True,"""A forgotten classic"".

It's undoubtedly the best bullet-time game ever. I'm writing this review in 2017 and the graphics are still neat looking. The textures are good throughout, and the damage system, physics and particle effects are really extensive to a surprising level. You can blow little chunks of walls with your bullets, send enemies flying into the air as you shoot them with your Spas 12, which btw is one of the best feeling shotguns in any game ever, and the ragdoll physics is fantastic you're questioning yourself why is there no game since, that has  used this feature to this level of detail.

As for the level design, it is simply fantastic. The game is semi linear with a little backtracking involved to collect health and armor. Also exploration is encouraged so you can pick up health and reflex bonuses so you can make life a little easier. 

As far as the difficulty goes, this game's pretty easy and that's my only complaint. But, you can remedy it by doing either one of two things : 
1. Just pick the 'Extreme' difficulty setting if you want some challenge, or 
2. Simply unbind Slow Mo from the controls menu and enjoy the game like any normal first person shooter on the Normal/Hard difficulty. Do note that the expansion packs Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate get progressively harder but it's nothing you can't handle even on the Extreme difficulty if you're decent at fps games. If you're wondering what's the point of playing Fear without slow mo, trust me, it's actually great even without slow mo as long as you're not playing Perseus Mandate (hardest expansion) on Extreme difficulty.

Another major pro for this game is the Ai. They flank you, they hide behind cover, they try to surround you.. They act like real people, only not as good as a shooter as you are, especially if you are using your slow mo powers. 

Sadly, the game isn't all that scary, atleast for me (I was barely scared playing this after playing other horror games like Amnesia the Dark Descent, Alien Isolation etc), but this may even be a good thing for people who shy away from games with the horror tag.

This game has stood the test of time, and I would recommend anyone and everyone to pick this game up. Doesn't matter if you don't like horror or first person shooters. If you got a pc, just stop reading and buy this game already. It even runs on a Dual core pc without a graphics card, just don't expect all the special effects and physics features to be as detailed as I explained above."
76561198083824913,1477022798,True,"A corridor shooter that knows it’s a corridor shooter and plays like a corridor shooter.  Other than the “horror” elements the game developers clearly did not have any pretenses about it being anything more than a fairly well balanced FPS shooter.  After all most of the action happens while moving through rooms or tunnels so there’s no point hiding the fact that it’s a “corridor” shooter and the game seems to make the most out of it.  A hallmark of a good FPS is that the weapons maintain a consistent rate of damage throughout the game and F.E.A.R. did a good job in this area.  

Being a corridor shooter I didn’t mind all the indoor scenes.  I thought they did a decent job of trying to vary the interior settings.  I was pleasantly surprised to be fighting through some unfinished rooms that were still being drywalled.  To me that shows a desire on the part of the developers to try and vary the interior surroundings.  I would actually consider Dead Space to be of the most excruciating linear corridor shooters I’ve ever played.  At least the developers of F.E.A.R. made an attempt to vary the setting as much as possible.  

I thought the graphics were good for a game of this age, particularly the interiors.  The character models were the usual blocky mannequin style not on the same level as the backgrounds.  The sounds design was superb, particularly the weapons and the music was, of course, top notch.  Other than the gimmicky “SlowMo” feature it’s a pretty good straight forward shooter.  I found that the weapon damage was so consistent that I didn’t have to rely so much on the SlowMo feature and I could even take out a “Heavy” if I planned it right without using Slow Motion.

However, regardless of all positives mentioned above, I personally found that the synthesis of a combat shooter with horror elements rather incongruous.  It seemed like two different games.  The whole time while playing F.E.A.R. I kept thinking all this trouble with Alma could have been resolved so easily had they made one call.  Who you gonna call when you have trouble with ghosts?  A couple of proton pack from the Ghostbusters could have solved the Alma situation fairly quickly.  To me that’s the problem when you mix two different genres together.  It never made sense to me that you had to shoot at spirits that came flying at you or get killed.  At least the horror elements were kept to a minimum.  In the expansion pack Extraction Point the horror elements are played up more and I found them to be just annoying.  The fact that 95% of the F.E.A.R. games consists of nothing more than shooting your way through one room to another, tells me that the horror elements could have been replaced with just about anything and the gameplay would have been just as good.

Even in an overhyped, pretentious, middling shooters games like BioShock the story wasn’t really that important because you’re still doing the same thing; shooting your way from one room to another with lots of backtracking to expand a minimum game into maximum time.  Ditto for Dead Space.  I have to smile when I read reviews from major gaming sites that talk about the great stories in these games because anybody who has ever read a comic book would have figured out the “surprise” ending of both of F.E.A.R. or BioShock almost at the beginning of the game.  Of the games that I’ve played the only one that had a decent story which was actually relevant to the game was Metro 2033 and that’s because the game was based on the novel of the same name (a good novel at that).  

Of the two expansion packs Perseus Mandate was definitely the worst.  The graphics were a step down, the character models were awful and it just felt like a game that was quickly slapped together.  The worst thing about it was the fickle shooting, it's the total reverse of the original F.E.A.R.  As a matter of fact I found the weapon damage to be so inconstant that I had to rely a little more on the slowmo feature in this game that in the original.  Also the shooting in this game threw up way more blinding dust than the other F.E.A.R. games, making shooting very difficult at times.  Of course, although you couldn’t see through the dust the enemy was not hampered by it.  

Perseus Mandate also came with 3 really short bonus missions, 2 of them were fun the other one called “Arena” was a dog (if your character even farted in that game he would throw up a huge cloud of blinding dust, it was that bad).  Everything wrong with Perseus Mandate was magnified in that Arena mission.  Fortunately, there were no horror elements in any of the bonus missions, they were just straight shooters.  Having said all that, I would probably rather replay Perseus Mandate than either the overly pretentious BioShock or the horribly linear Dead Space.

I would rate the games this way:
Original F.E.A.R. game: A
F.E.A.R.: Extraction point: B-
F.E.A.R.: Perseus Mandate: C-

76561198127640356,1476461846,True,"This game is fantastic. Loved the story (since you figure it out with in-depth analysis on a psychological level... or, google if you prefer), intense gameplay with some good frights, but not too many. 

F.E.A.R. still manages to scare me, even if I'm a badass soldier-type-character, and it captured me, as the player, in quite the addictive immersion I didn't see coming. 

Would recommend this game, for sure."
76561198089665885,1476379881,True,"If this game would be a CoD, it would be a good CoD."
76561197971636562,1476336140,True,"I just now replayed the game from the beginning to the end including all expansions. It amazes me how well this games holds on with current FPS titles. The graphics is still good. It's easy to play this game on max settings since it's a old game, but it looks great for it's time. Gameplay is great too. Everything is pretty much works as you would expect from a corridor FPS title but it's good if you're after this experience.

While I tried to follow the story it's still confused me at time since it's told quite sloppy but thanks to the expansions I had a chance to have a deeper look to the events of the world since I was really curious who is who and why things happened the way they did. Overall it's okay but don't expect much. It's a old style shooter and it should tell you all you need to know. Mission is simple. Kill bad guys and monsters. Survive till the end.

Overall it's surprisingly good game. If you're after old style FPS experience I can't recommend it enough."

76561197982231182,1476001885,True,"A good FPS with solid gameplay and only slightly dated graphics... 

 FEAR is a good FPS which aims for atmospheric (and misses), has issues with pacing and tries for an interesting storyline but stretches it out so much it starts to get incredibly dull.... FEAR 2 perfects those things. Play that game first, then come back to FEAR if your a completionist..."
76561197977815343,1475861174,True,"F.E.A.R will always have the crown in the greatest horror shooter to be ever made (sorry Doom 3!!).  It has amazing atmosphere and matching soundtrack to fill in the empty space between those silent, almost dreading moments... In many ways, it is a true masterpiece because of this blend. 

I played it first on the XBOX 360 and was terrified of some moments. Playing it *again* on the PC still proves that the game has enough magic to scare me at times. I’m not afraid to admit I’ve jumped and even pushed myself away from my screen at the moments I’ve forgotten about. The storyline, though a little cheesy, can be easily followed and enjoyed. The original FEAR is also VERY compatible with windows 10, despite it being pretty old now (I can't say the same about the two expansion packs.)

If you are looking for a fantastic shooter with gore and bullet time, then FEAR will satisfy all of your needs.
"
76561198014030361,1475642257,True,"Wow this is a satisfying game. Playing without slomo gives off a demonic creepiness due to the high speed of enemies and weapons. The tension is high because you often don't have much reaction time to turn on slomo before you've been outgunned. The enemies feel truly superhuman. Turn on slomo and the game becomes eye candy as bullets fling bodies and particles about.

This game is rather timeless, and mechanically outshines many shooters that have come out since.

Also as a complete horror weakling this is about as much as I can handle. Any more horror than this and games become unplayable for me :)"
76561198161888144,1475560373,True,"Just beat the game and really enjoyed it! It controls smoothly, graphics are decent, didn't encounter many bugs. Solidly programmed! The story is relatively vague, but it is still intruiging and progressed nicely. Flashbacks, some laptops, and voicemessages help piece things together. Not a very scary game besides a jumpscare or two that got me. In fact, I found myself laughing a good bit at some of the enemy reactions! I just kill somebody and another guy shouts our, ""Are you all right?"" Freaking roflcopter! The atmosphere is wonderful! From open areas that make you feel vulnerable to tight, dark corridors that keep you on edge, the variety of the settings kept the game feeling fresh. There are sometimes different routes to take to complete your objectives which gives a level of strategy. Sadly the enemies were pretty much copy and pasted with a few tougher armored ones here and there. If the enemies were as varied as the different environments, I'd be even happier! I have not yet tried the multiplayer, so no comment there. However, singleplayer was definitely fun and worth a play!"

The expansions are better than the original game.  Extraction point has a lot more action condensed than the base game.  Perseus Mandate starts off poor but by about halfway through it is an incredible experience with a lot less empty hallway stuff that is in the base game and extraction point.

10/10 for both expansions.

Play time 8 hours for base F.E.A.R. game.  5 hours for Extraction Point. 6-7 hours for Perseus Mandate with the bonus missions. Really a lot of content for the price and the gunplay is so excellent it never got old."

Still, unless you get a great deal, this game has some seriously wonky game mechanics, funky graphics, and crashes now and again. don't bother getting this on its own.

i'd add that fear 2 and fear 3 are MUCH MUCH BETTER, so if you're more of a gameplay person, get fear 3. its the best. if you HAVE to have the story, get fear 2. it's very important. Fear 1 is really unimportant story wise because most of the content is covered in 2 and 3, effectively sweeping fear 1 under the rug. 

Thats my 2 cents anyway."

The story is interesting (if not vague) enough to keep you wanting to plow forward to advance the nonlinear narrative. I only ran into a few crashes/freezes but most were fixed by just restarting the game albeit a few times. I also recommend the DLCs as they add a bit to the story and add more scares.
76561198105445916,1474900027,True,"An outdated FPS that still manages to hold up. Shooting mechanics are incredibly satisfying, A.I. intelligently attempts flanking maneuvers, and the story (though minimal) is quite intriguing. Definitely recommended if you can get past its aged graphics and lack of iron sights.

If you're looking for a game to scare you, however, look elsewhere. F.E.A.R. develops a tense atmosphere, but fails to actually deliver on what the atmosphere builds up to. In short, it shouldn't scare you at all."

If you are a fan of Half-Life, Red Faction or even Counter Strike you will enjoy this game. It is genuinely full of scares and some freaky enemies. Plays like an old classic first-person shooter, you pick up health packs and ammo, none of that regenerating health from more modern games. I've yet to play the expansion packs but i know that after beating the main campaign at 9 and a half hours, i will enjoy the shit out of them!"

They have put a lot of work in making sure that the A.I. is responsive to you´re actions so do not expect any handouts in fights.

Very well developed and big thumbs up for the stunning visuals."
76561198089960469,1474201694,True,"So far I have only delved maybe 3 and a half hours into the game, plus a good hour many years ago at a friend's house. Back then I didn't quite appreciate the combat mechanics enough to get the game myself and play it. Now that I'm not an idiot, I have to say I really like the combat. These days, games bore me quickly. Same shooter mechanics, same plotlines of rich people being the villains that cause all the drama, and the same quick cash-grab features that we eat up for some reason. Who could have guessed that a Steam Sale of a game made back in 2005 would have shaken me violently out of that rut?

The enemy AI is refreshing compared to the standard. I'm forced to think about how to fight the enemy. The combat itself is dangerous; you can't just go out to shoot people, taking a few hits in the process, and then let your health regenerate like nothing happened. I'm forced to be economical about my decisions, my bullets, and my health kits. The game is also quite deceptive with their slow-mo mechanic that lets you think you can be Rambo or John Woo.

As for the horror aspect of the game, lots of instances I feel underwhelmed as I usually do in video games. However, there are a few that just make me p00p myself--at the very least, I feel VERY uneasy. While I haven't yet finished the game, I just wanted to let people know that it is definitely a nice take on a shooter that I wish I got into years ago. I look forward to finishing this game and playing the other ones that I also got in the sale."

•	The atmosphere in the game is really good. The game can be very unsettling and nerve racking. There are plenty of scary moments in the game and there are also some disturbing parts. Feels like you are watching a true horror film.
•	Good level design. I liked how they used locations which are familiar to everyday people, like the industrial district, office blocks, warehouses and etc     which goes well with the horror theme.
•	Brilliant Antagonists. Paxton Fettel and Alma are both creepy and scary characters, who both toy with the Protagonist.
•	A great selection of weapons in the game, which are very fun to use in slo-mo especially the Shotgun. 
•	Very interesting story. 
•	The sound affects in the game are fantastic, especially when Fettel and Alma toy with the player. 
•	Smart A.I. The replica soldiers are quite clever; they take cover, they throw grenades, and they react quickly, when grenades are being thrown back at them. The gameplay can be challenging.
•	There are hidden upgrades in the game, like the health booster and slo-mo booster.  
•	Both expansion packs have new weapons and enemies.    

[u]What I disliked or was disappointed with[/u] 

•	I wish the flashlight in the game could have lasted a bit longer before it had to recharge.
•	Because the gameplay in both of the expansion packs is the same as the original fear. They can become a bit boring and repetitive. When I came to playing Perseus Mandate, I found the game not particularly scary or unsettling and bit boring. 

[u]Conclusion[/u] 

This is a brilliant horror FPS game. I highly recommend it to any horror game fan or fps fan, a classic. 87/100

76561198000555757,1473981920,True,"Wickedly good game that still holds up. The AI is surprisingly smart and knows how to flank, there's multiple approaches to levels, the weapons feel great but don't feel overpowering, even melee combat is well executed.

One thing that stands out is that there's the ability to lean behind cover, which as odd as it sounds, makes this game less of a cover shooter. Staying stationary generally won't work.

This game isn't so much a horror game as it is an action game with horror elements (which is probably obvious), but it does do a really good job of making you uneasy at various parts. Some parts legitimately scared me, and not in a cheap way like with a half-baked jumpscare. It's not in-your-face with the horror elements, which makes them that much more gripping when they do appear.

It's also an excellent example of how limitations of the time were used to invent new mechanics (especially in implementing 'horror' aspects). I can't really go into details without spoiling some great moments.

Definitely a must-play. It's cheap, it's wildly fun, and it's way better than the sequels."
76561198058294204,1473961445,True,"[Some very minor spoilers below]

--

F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) is a horror-themed FPS from 2006. I got it for free from a friend a few weeks ago as a gift because they had an extra copy from some bundle or another.

It's an interesting game and for one that is ten years old it's held up remarkably well, I'll cover some things below in detail but first, if you're looking for a *horror game* this may or may not be what you're looking for. 

FEAR (I ain't typing the dots every time, sorry) isn't like many more recent games that seek to either hit you with jump scares repeatedly or ratchet up the existential terror (something like, say, SOMA). FEAR is an FPS first and foremost, the vast majority of things in this game can be shot, wapped on the head with a gun, or given a flying judo kick (note: this is somewhere between awesome and hilarious, depending on the kind of person you are you'll either judo kick everything or avoid using it at all). And being able to defeat most of the things that present that scary factor does suck some of the terror out of them, but, there are also what I'll broadly term 'hallucinatory' entities that you can't defeat, and even that aside, the game does a *remarkably* good job of keeping tension high even when you know this.

Still, FEAR is an FPS and lives and dies on its gunplay, which is remarkably solid. It's a little different than what you're probably used to if you haven't played something more than ~5 years old in a while, but it's fairly easy to get a handle on. The game doesn't have ironsights as such but there's a ""zoom"" button you can use to much the same effect. You can also get through most of the game's encounters by shooting from the hip just fine providing your aim's decent. The game's core mechanic is a sort of bullet time button. It's not a unique feature, but it's used to decent effect here and I must say, hearing the deep-voiced replica soldiers' voices slow down as they yell ""FUCK"" and you shotgun them in the face is [i]hilarious.[/i] It does a lot to keep the atmosphere from becoming *too* oppressive. Other than that it's pretty standard 2000s FPS fare. You can carry three weapons but there's only about (without looking it up) 8 or so in the game so you can make almost any combination work, it's not the most challenging game in the world and anyone with experience in, say, Halo, should be able to tackle it easily, but to me at least challenge has never really been the point of a game like this.

Lastly there's a lot to love about the environmental design. It's a *little* repetitive but this is to an extent justified by the setting (most of the game takes place in an office high-rise). You'll be seeing, basically, four types of areas: run-down abandoned buildings (mostly in the beginning and end of the game), office buildings (which make up the vast majority), maintenance areas within said office buildings, and rooftops. But it's well-constructed enough that it works and the local audio logs (messages left on phones) are nice. The dialog is vulgar, often to the point of exaggeration, and you can kinda tell it was aiming to be ""mature"" in a very 2006 sort of way, but it's not bad and I often found myself amused by the constant back and forthing between various evil corporation bigwigs trying to pass blame off onto other evil corporation bigwigs (which makes up many of the phone messages). There are a few NPCs but they're mostly not worth mentioning just because the same criticisms and praises apply.

I'd recommend FEAR if ""a good mid-2000s shooter"" is something on your shopping list, or if you're just looking to try something you missed out on when it was new.

Enthusiastic thumbs-up."
76561198037309081,1473942161,True,"First of all, I love the original F.E.A.R. game. I just finished it for the second time and it was still worth the time. However, the Extraction Point expansion was very disappointing. On one computer it kept crashing every two minutes, and on another it didn't crash but slowed down until it was unplayable. I finished the game, but it took me twice as long as it should have because it is so buggy. However, I wouldn't recommend Extraction Point even if it had worked properly. I found it repetitive and boring, and at times plain silly compared to the original game. I had the same problems with Perseus Mandate on one computer, but on another it works just fine and seems to be more enjoyable than Extraction Point."
76561198074592331,1473753224,True,"Best horror game ,i played it when i was a kid and now i bought it and play again."
76561198064922404,1473716195,True,"It's a fantastic game. If you're a horror fan, it's a must play.

Not only is it a very strong horror game, it's a damn good first person shooter. It shows a very strong polish that allows it to defy age. The environment's hitboxes were particularly strong. They all seemed very accurate, and I was able to use the thin gaps in the environment to my advantage. Not once was I hit by a bullet and questioned that it shouldn't have been able to hit me, nor the contrary.

The graphics hold up well. I wasn't distracted by the graphics like I was in, say, the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion. Genres play a role in that, of course.

The story is interesting, but lacks a grip. What I mean is, I was eager to reach the end, but I wasn't interested in the journey. For the first half of the game, the notes and buildup to the story are rather dull. It picks up the closer you get. It took me a couple weeks to play through the first 6 hours, but then I completed the next 5 all in the same day. The first part wasn't bad, but I usually found myself playing other games because I wanted to play them more than F.E.A.R. 

The gameplay is, simply put, fun. I enjoy first person shooters, and this is better than many in that regard. The combat was challenging at times, but not rage-inducing. The AI is excellent. What I love is that they're not given benefits to make it more challenging. If you're quiet and sneaking, they don't know you're there until you open up on them. Once they know where you are, they strategize and move, focusing on taking you out. Once enough time passes without any indication you're still there, they'll take note of that and expand their focus and try to locate you. It's the best AI I've played with in a considerable amount of time. The environment usually allows for creativity in the situation. As in, it's not always linear. The character gets unnerved. Getting hit with bullets severely impacts your aim (which sways ever so slightly). This is what I mean by polish; everything had its fair share of attention.

I usually hear F.E.A.R. regarded as one of the best horror games, and it deserves the spot. While the story takes too long to get moving, the rest of the game excels from start to finish."

76561198076859069,1472760192,True,"Roughly half of the game is a horror, and the other half a first-person shooter. You need to be at least a little bit of a fan of both in order to enjoy it.

That said though, I bought the game almost entirely for the horror aspect, and boy, I was not disappointed.

The game does one thing which I feel a bunch of full-fledged horror games don't do well enough - during the vast majority of the game, [u]I did not want to move forward[/u]. The atmosphere was constantly spooky, even when nothing was happening, and I was constantly dreading whether the next thing that would happen would be a fight or a fright. The game does a relatively good job of being unpredictable in that regard, which I also think is a sign of a good horror."
76561198024775673,1472718916,True,"Quite possibly the best and most immersive AI enemies I have ever encountered. For example in some fire fights a Replica will call out ""We've got X down"" X being the people you have just killed and it's not scripted! I have been counfounded and butchered by this AI so many times. Flanking, real time stratagy and tactical choices by the Replica's really make the First Person Shooter aspect original and unique even today. The story is simply fantastic and completely original, theres really nothing quite like it. As for the Horror aspect, well not even the original Dead Space game ever make scare me as badly, and may or may not have made me piss my pants a little as this game. Ladders man. I reccomend this game to everyone."

76561198043602251,1472313099,False,"In a word, mediocre.  The setting is disjointed.  The maps are contrived.  The gameplay is nothing special.  The big crime for me however is the spooky factor simply isn't there.  There is this promise of supernatural in the game, but it takes a back seat to just shooting guys in riot gear.  There are moments of ghostly action, but they have zero impact on gameplay.  Conversely, the gameplay is rather irrelevant to the story.  The first couple times something spooky happens you're like omg what's going on, but once you realize there is no impact, no combat related to it, you just start blowing off the hauntings so the whole thing loses apeal.  After 6 hours of playing I was bored with it as nothing was keeping it fresh or engaging.  I felt like I was just struggling through shooting people to get to 5 minutes of unrelated story, and that simply wasn't worth it."

I hadnt played the game back when it wasn't released and I was afraid a lot of the horror element would be lost for me because of its dated graphics and general aging. While this was true to an extent after the first 20 minutes it really picked and some genuine terrifying moments left me afraid to continue!

You are allowed to hold 3 guns and at a time, all quite varied, and a slow-mo mechanic that allows from slow-mo gore, which really impressed me.

Storyline is great and interesting...although at times got a bit unneccasarily goofy. Overall its a very good shooter and its age is starting to show but definetely not as fast as other games from that period!"
76561198044797961,1471731077,True,"A first person shooter from good to average. Graphics are decent, but some enviroments are a bit repetitve, similar and dull. Sometimes game present bugs, like frozen screens and keys that not respond, but to solve is enough pressing Ctrl + Alt + Sup or pause and continue respectively. Other times the keys respond later, has no solution. Sadly, the actual Steam version is not dubbed into other languages

Mechanics is classic and runs well, player can jump, crouch and run, but no to sprint. Health can be restored by medkits, there are many, and can carry 10. There is replaceable armour,  but its protection lasts short. There are 8 kinds of weapons, all dangerous and with many ammo to find and carry; player can carry 3 guns, with 5 grenades of 3 types each, no knifes or something. Very good weapons effects, like smoke. Enemies are well designed, but there are few types. 

The gameplay runs fine at begining, but after the first half degenerates in ambushes where perhaps the explosives are excessively determinants. Player can save at will, a good feature rare in nowdays. The plot is common, with some little frights. The mapping is lineal, with hidings and two pathways to choose sometimes, but at second half turns on lineal just. Main campaign is quite short: at high difficultly lasting 18 hours; but its two expansions adds 9 and 12 hours each."
76561198084661861,1471692902,True,"F.E.A.R is a fantastic game. In an age with trite like FNAF, that solely relies on cheap jumpscares with next to no gameplay, F.E.A.R is a shining beacon of quality horror gaming. Sure it does rely on jumpscares a lot, but when it's not scaring you, I'm terrified I will be terrified a minute later. This with the fact your flashlight drains really quickly, then you have to let it recharge for a moment. This single feature causes more FEAR (get it?) for me than the scares themselves. I end up hiding in a corner waiting for my flashlight to recharge, only to do it 20 seconds later. Even the jumpscares in this game can be smart, for example (that I still remember to this day), where you're in an office building, walking down a hallway, with cubicles to the left. All of a sudden, I hear a phone ring, and I instinctively turn to the left. Once I see the phone, a monster just jumps out at me. Call it a jumpscare, but then I had to actually fight that monster, not a thing a lot of horror games do (I'm looking at you, FNAF!). I haven't even gotten to the gunfighting, a reason this game is worthwhile. If it was just a horror game, it wouldn't be all that. But because it's also an incredible first person shooter, with a very satisfying slow-mo button. Just buy it, it's great."

76561197991247512,1471301820,True,"What can I say? If you are a fan of that sweet, sweet early 2000's FPS aesthetic, look no further. FEAR is like fine wine, and age has certainly not spoiled this incredible game. If this is your first time then you're in for a treat, as this is one of the most atmospheric and spooky games I've ever played, to this day. If you've played it before, I guarantee it's just as good as you remember.

The only downside is the fact that you have to buy all the games together in a pack. For me, this is where things get complicated:

FEAR 1, I believe, is the best in the series. From the tactical lean, to the dynamic and reactive enemies, to the tension-filled atmosphere that makes you want to scream and start firing after accidentally knocking over a paint can, FEAR 1 is what set the bar for the series in my opinion. The graphics are a bit dated, but they still look cool in their own charming way.

FEAR 2 is a huge graphical jump, and for the most part it retains a lot of the things that made FEAR 1 great. It replaced the 'free lean' (hit Q and E) with 'contextual lean' (like in recent Battlefield and CoD games), which I have mixed feelings about. It adds ADS and a fire-selector for most of the weapons, which makes it feel more tactical. The seamless story transition between FEAR 1 and FEAR 2 will make it clearly to anyone playing that this is the only true sequel to FEAR, as its the only game in the series that retains the feel of the original FEAR.

You see, FEAR and FEAR 2: Project Origin are the only two games that were made by Monolith, and so they're really the only two games you should consider 'canon' in the story. Perseus Mandate and Extraction Point are fun, sure, but they're both cash grabs who were made by WB without Monolith's input. The result is the events of both Perseus Mandate and Extraction Point are never really mentioned again throughout the series, so you have two cool and fun games with no real place in the story. Play them, sure, but understand that's why it seems like their place in the story is basically forgotten later.

And then there's FEAR 3

Now, I've actually heard that some people like FEAR 3. If you get it for the co-op alone, it might actually be a decent shooter. But, in my humble opinion, FEAR 3 shouldn't even exist. Monolith had nothing to do with its production, and it shows. It doesn't look, feel, or sound like a FEAR game. The way Warner Bros decided to wrap up the series was campy, lazy, and very poorly written compared to the quality of the first, and even the second game. Don't get me wrong; FEAR 3 is certainly playable, maybe even enjoyable, but it's not a FEAR game.

tl;dr Get this pack if you are on a nostalgia quest. FEAR 1 and 2 are the only mainline story games, and the rest of the games are the equivalent of anime filler made by Warner Bros to get more $$$"

76561197969489829,1470554899,True,"FEAR is pretty cool, I guess.

Set in the distant future of the next Tuesday. A psychic that goes by the name of Paxton Fettel takes control of an army of clone super soldiers known as the Replicants, or Stank Patrol, and slaughters the employees of the Armacham Technology Corporation, even the Janitor wasn't spared.  

You play as the Point-Man, a operator of FEAR (First Encounter Assault Recon) who saw a hella ton of John Woo movies and was like “Yeah, I can do that.” 
Turns out he totally can. 

You and your team are sent in to deal with Paxton's hissy fit and put that balding bitch back in his cage. But strangely enough, you are also haunted by this mysterious little ghost girl in a red dress, causing your screen to flicker and flash before she goes “Boo!” and makes you jump like a nerd. Haha, nerd. 

FEAR is a first person shooter of the best kind. You are given a plethora of weapons and sent out to go shoot some stupid clones in their stupid clone faces. Gunfights in FEAR are probably the best thing ever. Not only is it satisfying gory but everything just kind of explodes in it all. Walls turn into dust, office work goes flying, tables are flipped over, windows shatter, the whole kitten caboodle. Monolith's love for John Woo gun fights are more than apparent in this game. 

The Stank Patrol themselves are probably one of FEAR's greatest element. They're not only just goons that run at you and volunteer to hold on to your bullets using their brains and internal organs, but they also act like people who actually want to kill you. 

They take cover, suppress, flank, and even make a run for it if they're losing. I actually had a Replicant ditch a fight and I couldn't find him for the life of me. Then I gave up and went on, and three rooms later I was suddenly shot in the back. The punk was hiding in a cubicle and waiting for me like some sort of sneaky... Clone... Prick. And I loved it. 

Every now and then, the game tries to spook you. But the game actually warns you before the spooking happens. Every time Alma, the little girl in the red dress, or Paxton try to mess with you, your hud will flicker a bit to give you a heads up that not everything is right. It's kind of...Well stupid and takes out a lot of tension from any scare since you see it coming. Unlike condemned, some of these scares actually sort of got me and made me drop the monocle from my eye and go “I say!” 

Should you play FEAR?

Yeah.

No, that's all you're getting, FEAR is mad good even all these years. 

It's 1:30 AM and I've done 5 reviews today. So all you're getting is a Yeah out of Maybe.

76561197993702081,1470492472,True,"This game was released on October 17th in 2005. It is now August 6th, 2016.

It has been almost 11 years since this games release and to this day it still holds up incredibly well. The graphics are gritty and still pretty detailed in a lot of respects, the effects are still incredible, the movements and animations still as solid as ever. The voice acting is timeless, the soundtrack is as great as ever at building the right atmosphere for this game.

While it lacks some features included in more modern FPS games such as Iron-Sights (the game utilizes an old-school Zoom-In style) it makes up for it by including features that now are not so common, such as the ability to lean around corners (Fun if you're a more tactical player, perhaps less used however if you are a martial-arts warrior) and health kits. 

The gameplay and gunfights themselves still hold up incredibly with a high emphasis on skill and very little handholding. If you so desire it and have the precision, you can face a Mech unit and shoot its missiles as they are fired, then kick it to death. This remains true even on the highest difficulties.

The horror aspect varies from person to person. I personally find it to be genuinely creepy, its pretty well done and manages to be fairly eerie all around. Some may not like the jump scares much, but for every jumpscare in the game there are 2 moments of subtle horror. Reflections in mirrors, pictures on monitors, and I'm sure some things I still haven't noticed even throughout my 6 or so playthroughs of the game.

Another of this game's virtues is that it doesn't hold your hand much in terms of where to go (although levels can be somewhat linear) and the story elements. If you want to know more about the story, it is important that you pick up the audio logs and answering machines.

This game is in my honest opinion a 9/10, and I mean that by the old standard where 9/10 was absolutely phenominal. I cannot reccomend this game enough.

Finally I'll say this to any new buyers: FEAR is fantastic and I think FEAR: Extraction Point is a great addition. Perseus Mandate however isn't too interesting, and I think it is probably for the best to stay away from FEAR 2 (which, while not terrible, isn't more than say a 6/10 FPS) and definitely stay away from FEAR 3.

Hope this review was useful.

The graphics are fine too, very crisp, and everything casts a shadow, and the player model doesn't feel floaty or anything.

76561198153426430,1469561660,False,"meh.

i'm somewhat null to alot of stories and games these days because of scarring left behind. this makes it difficult for me to let myself feel much, especially when it's pretty obvious that no one is going to live and that shit is never gonna go to plan.

that means aside from the twist, it was easy enough to guess that the character was gonna end up in a shi* situation and that bad things would happen to good people you don't wanna see hurt. which closed me up. i didn't find much to be scary enough to make my hairs stand on end, but the could be because as a game character you know you can't die otherwise how would you play?

then theirs the fact that i was expecting some creepy stuff, but none of it wasn't anything i haven't seen before. 

mind you, this is my first time playing the game, back on release would i have been more freaked out due to being less exposed to other games like it? possibly...but i didn't play it then. which means i have to judge it on the here and now.

and my judgement is, aside from a few moments where i didn't see a erry monster coming at me from my corner i didn't really ever get scared. again i feel that i was emotionally guarded because i knew anyone i let myself get attached to would just die so that is a factor.

then, lets talk about AI. there were moments were they pressured you, but there were mostly alot of cheap shots. example, i'm in slow mo mode pounding a guy with bullets on the crappy AR and the guy still manages to get a good shot on me occasionally. often enough to make you think about health and cover even if he's the only guy standing.

 a)to me this a cheap move or lazy work on the dev's part. it breaks immersion. in a game like this, immersion matters a lot.
 b) the enemy, unless standing over your head on a walkway are completely silent. the only time you even know if someone is in the same small room as you is if you walk by them and get shot in the back.
 c) so the next point is, the sound of tracking enemies is crap.
 d) also their bullet sponges on hard or higher. it's not very bad though, you can still kill them in one clip, but when you get a gun that can literally melt everything but your bones it raises an eyebrow when you shoot a human in the chest and he could doubles over like he got punched in the gut.

3) level desing: you know, one thing i hate is getting turned around when i just wont to move on and shoot things. now sure, it's not entirely a shooter game, but it sure as he** is linier in level design. yet, i still can't make heads or tails and go around in circles because in some places it's alittle bit like a maze. then in another place, i spent 30 minutes in one small area trying to move on only to realize i'm suppose to jump off and over the ledge that looks perfectly like it goes nowhere execpt that it's a next level load point. i'll point out, that you get hurt jumping off of ledges in any other situation in-game so why the f*** would i think to jump off that one?

4) guns: the guns for the most part aren't bad, execpt that near the end of the game they remove your guns and stick you with the starter weapon. which is a good gun, but that's a BS move. FEAR isn't the only game doing this though, but i still wish they didn't. they aren't the best, personally i've played with better ""feeling"" guns. note: it was the end-game guns that i'm really complaining about. my remote bombs packed more punch than they did.

5) as far as i can tell, there is no level select or new game +, which is always a disappointment.

given the option, i'd rather play TimeShift again than this. the slow mo and puzzle are more brain food than the weak puzzles installed here. before you say there weren't any, there was...built into the maze level desings. 

i won't talk about graphics because it's acceptible for the time period, i played at supported resolutions. i do feel the game would have benifitted from a FOV slider though."

76561198025334646,1469000927,True,"TL;DR: A good tactical shooter, still holds up well today.

So as a note, I am not an expert on FPS's, nor the particular history of the FEAR franchise or how it affected other shooters. I am merely writing this review in regard to the game as it stands today, not historically.

FEAR (I'm not putting those periods in every time I write it) is ostensibly a tactical shooter with horror elements. Fairly old now, after playing it I feel it still holds up well. It is a fun game to play through, and the visuals hold up well enough, given when it was released. The gameplay itself holds up amazingly well, and it is a very engaging game.

The gameplay itself is mostly in the tactical shooter genre, in that you by yourself (No squadmates), confront large squads of fairly intelligent AI enemies. While not a cover based shooter, it is important to use cover to your advantage, as the enemies definitely will, and you can get minced fairly quick just acting as a turret. The enemies themselves will call out to each other, use cover, suppressing fire, and the like in order to try and take you down. How the AI compares to more modern shooters I am not sure, but it felt smart enough that I wasn't gunning them down in droves easily. The environments are varied enough that you are adjusting to each level's style to look for proper cover and where enemies might be hiding. There is a bit where it feels like you are in offices forever, and it starts to drag a bit. Finding your way through the game is pretty much going from A to B, only a few choices in routes that diverge very shortly. There are some items to find and story elements to listen to, but nothing that stops you from plowing on through. Movement has almost no execution challenges, which was a big plus for me as I am currently rather tired of FPS's that try to be platformers.

Tool-wise, you are given the pretty standard FPS variety to choose from, rifle, shotgun, pistol/dual pistol, SMG, along with some fancier guns with more limited ammo (Rail gun, particle gun, multi-rocket launcher, assault cannon). You can only hold 3, so I went with my two main stays (The shotgun which took out enemies fairly quickly if aimed right and close enough, not using up too much ammo), the rifle (ran out of ammo quicker than I got it, but good for precise shooting), and a fancy gun depending on the stage. You also get 3 different 'grenade' types, the standard sort that also explode on contact, mines, and remote detonated sticky bombs. I mostly used the first two, as the last required you to put away your gun, and I felt that the set up required wasn't worth the boom. In addition to weapons, other pickups include health (you can hold up to 10 health kits, I was usually maxed or close), armor, and items that permanently increase your maximum health and reflex. The pickups were valuable enough that I was scouring stages for ammo/health/armor/power ups, with the added bonus that it also lets you find the story elements as well, but I never felt I had to scour every inch of the stage.

The reflex was probably the selling point for the game along with the smart enemies, as it puts you into a slo-mo mode that allows you to take more careful aim and dodge better. It recharges pretty quickly, so you can use it every other encounter or so if they are coming at you rapid-paced. Mostly it felt it most useful for taking very careful aim (it let you adjust for recoil very well), or for nailing groups with the shotgun more readily. The slowed sound and effects definitely make it feel awesome.

The story is one of the horror genre, though it mostly gets that through the hallucinations and pop-up moments from the resident spooky girl. I wasn't too freaked out by it, as you pretty quickly identify which illusions can hurt you (hint, lots of fire, humanoid things rushing you), and the rest just serve to be spooky. The story is decent, there have been far better since it came out to fit into the horror genre, and the fact that if you can't shoot it, it can't hurt you causes things to stop being spooky/scary.

The only part that probably doesn't hold up nowadays is the graphics. The textures are flat, shots of the city in the distance are decidedly not cinematic, and faces are really blegh. I'm sure someone who keeps up with the most recent FPS's would scoff, but I found it didn't detract from the experience at all. It doesn't affect gameplay, so I didn't care.

Overall, FEAR still holds up as a fun gameplay experience. It is no longer top of the line, but the shooting elements hold up well, and it is good for an evening or two of fun getting through it."

It is hard to find flaws in this game, only two I can forcefully find is a bit dated graphic(and with it some strange behavior of some objects and bodies), the 2nd is the end of multiplayer support.

As DLCs are concerned, both are good and offer long time of additional play, just as it should be. Extraction Point for me is insanely bloody, but with a very nice story twist, which was unfortunately abandoned in the next parts of the game. Perseus Mandate is more a shooter, but still scary enough, it also contains a pack of additional missions which even further enhances game time.

At the end that was a first horror FPS I've enjoyed (and I hate horrors) - I highly recommend this game."
76561198027973635,1468930818,True,All of the Fear 1 stuff is good.
76561198145314799,1468896413,True,"First review, be gentle. I have not completed either of the DLCs but I have just recently completed the main story.

This game is amazing, it hits the nail on the head as far as story, gameplay, horror and difficulty. If you enjoy first person shooters of any kind this game is a must have.

Pros
-varied weapon choice
-interesting combat
-fun game mechanics
-limited ammo on high powered guns
-rewards exploration
-Awesome story
-good visuals despite old game

Cons
-linear story with few choices (save for bonus areas with exploration), makes for little replayability
-Game has issues with Logitech plugins (mouse, keyboard, etc.) but these are easily fixable either with online help or just unplugging your mouse whenever the game starts to freeze (this is what I did and it worked perfectly)

In a world that seems to be increasingly obsessed with ULTRA HIGH RES GRAPHICS rather than good story I feel that F.E.A.R. delivers in ways that only older games can. I even think that it is as good as if not better than most first person shooters coming out today.

I may update my review after finishing DLCs but maybe not."
76561197976541858,1468877142,True,"One of the best games ever made with fantastic gameplay, AI intelligence that have not been beaten to this day, level design that will leave you paranoid and compelling and complex storyline that maybe isnt most original but is the best executed in the genre."
76561198084900193,1468852299,True,"Highly enjoyed this game. When others say it the best FPS, they aren't lying.
Pro:
-Amazing A.I. for enemies
-Slow mo killing is fun
-good guns, loved the shot gun and dual pistols
-levels are large, got lost a few times
-was forced to think while playing

Cons:
-no help, I mean none at all from friendly A.I.
-gives no direction on were to go
-not scary

plot wise it was good, but don't expect character development. 
If ya a fan of video games, highly recommend playing this at least once as it is amazing and beats many of the new titles that came out over the past year."

Music:--------10/10
Gameplay:----10/10
Cutscenes:----9/10
Physics effects: 10/10



The walls, the narrow corridors, thy sky: All is dark, grey, muddy.
No open world. No self regenerating health.
Good things never die!

The game runs very fluently. It contains a benchmark option, too. 
Very high frames per second in ultra settings.


The slow movement effects are very good.
The more enemies are hit, the slower time is running. Even the sound gets slowed, getting lower.
Ragdoll effects, fantastic weapons.

There are many shocking scenes, horror.
The soundtrack and sound effects are comparable to Half Life 2 and Max Payne 2. 
The whole Fear series is fantastic."
76561197988441336,1468462861,True,"That game plays with shadows like no other, even today it works perfectly. Multiplayer is down but the campaign will assure you something like 10 hours of tension, a genius mix of horror/scary sequences and tough combats. Despite the lack of MP mode you'll find it quite challenging even on normal difficulty, not really hard at all, but you'll have to use wisely your bullet time, grenades, weapons, medkits, quicksaves and take good cover when under fire of multiple ennemies. AI is not the brightest ever but Replica's bullets can put you down very quickly if you stay too long in sights. 
The best comes once you get familiarized with the game: you'll be able to use bullet time not only before shooting at large groups of ennemies but also after to make beautiful slowdowns of your destructions :) 
I don't see any negative point, maybe the lack of various environnements: most of the game you'll make your way through relatively empty and similar streets, offices, storages, labs, can be a little boring for some people but Alma, Fettel, Replicas troopers and other ""things"" kept me alert all the time."
76561198028241902,1468409665,True,I like Perseus mandate.
76561197979757181,1468324823,False,"I love FPS.  Most the of the games I own are FPS and I've been playing them for decades.  I bought this game because it was on sale and people were calling it ""the best FPS EVER!"" in the reviews.  It's not.  It's physics and combat are very clunky and an early example of ""consolization"" of a game.  You don't self-heal and you can have more than two weapons but something DEFINITELY does not feel right.  There is basically ONE enemy and they pass this off in the story as the soldiers all being clones.  Combine this with lackluster weapons and barren indoor levels and you have some VERY boring and repetitive combat that NO amount of ""bullet time"" can spice up.  Throw in the embarrassing ""scary"" creepy kid and poltergeist moments and you have something that is scary but not in the right way.  Watching the making of video is pretty embarrassing as well and just shows you the over-produced bloat and ego that went into this game."
76561198304706620,1468196793,True,Silent Hill (kinda) meets Doom
76561197967685936,1468150825,True,"Again if steam allowed neutral status then this would be easier.

The good:
- feels like someone played a lot of Half Life
- gun fights with the bad guys
- weapons
- sounds
- different types of tools to dispose of enemies

The bad:
- boring and characterless environments, think generic office copy paste
- it's just a simple shooter, nothing more
- lasts 5 hours

The extremely bad:
- the horror elements - all of it should have been removed or reduced heavily

All in all, I do not regret buying this on sale, can't wait to see what they did in Fear 2 and 3 :)

Edit: Started playing the expansion, if it wasn't for the fact that the gun fights, simple puzzle and tools at your disposal so heavily remind me of Half Life (thanks to recent Black Mesa experiences) I would give this game a NO, but I really want more people to experience and enjoy those good gun fights.

Finished Extration Point: gun fights = good, horror elements = very very bad.
Finished Perseus Mandate = great gun fights and I like the bonus missions. Less horror elements but some are still there and annoying."

76561197995346518,1467862144,True,"Who is this Game For?
==================
F.E.A.R. is a secret force that deals with paranormal phenomena. In this first-person shooter, you become the new point man (what else?) who’s tasked with stopping a military experiment that’s gone bad. Fans FPS who doesn’t mind a little horror will find this game very enjoyable. The game’s graphics has aged a little, but the game play, AI and controls still hold up to this day as some of the best in FPS history.

Is it good?
=================
The scarier parts of the game are portrayed effectively, and some players will certainly react to the game’s eerie atmosphere. The in-game weaponry is rather basic, and includes a pistol, a submachine gun, a shotgun, and a rocket launcher. The most appealing gun is Nail gun, which fires high-velocity nails into enemies and can even pin them to walls. You can also kick enemies, as well as punch them or hit them with your rifle butt. You can only carry three weapons at a time, which forces you to choose the best ones for you. Another feature that can help you in the game is called Slowmo, which is similar to Max Payne’s infamous bullet time feature.

Does it have any problems?
========================
Being an older game with an old engine, some people might have problems. While had no problem, anyone else should be able to fix anything by check the PC Gamer Wiki: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/F.E.A.R.

Final Thoughts!
====================
The enemy A.I. in F.E.A.R. is great and, along with the excellent graphics engine and wonderful sound, you can play through many intensely enjoyable combat scenes. Most of the scenery explodes around you when impacted by bullets (like shattering wood, breaking windows, and parts of walls splatter all over), and the sound is certainly complementary to the general feeling of the battle scenes."
76561198144335211,1467855929,False,"Literally terrible. The combat is a joke. There are like 5 points in the game that may make you jump. Otherwise this is just a terrible shooter. Combat it uninspired and only there to make the game feel longer. Calling this game a psychological horror is a huge complement. The story is terrible and never gives you a good answer to anything. $9.99 is about $20 too much to pay for this game. Even better the dlc Extraction Point is literally ALL combat. It's a real thrill! Every time you shoot a guy and stagger him he will spray his gun which will inevitably headshot you or something and do massive damage. There is no replay value in this game. There is not even any play at all value in this game. Anyone that tries to tell you it is good because it is a ""classic"" is lying. Games like Goldeneye are good because they are classic. Not this game. If the levels didn't have combat and parts where you have to go down an extra path to flip a switch or some gay shit they would be about 5 minutes long. No exaggeration. Literally terrible."
76561198001779913,1467842262,True,"F.E.A.R really seems to have with stood the test of time. IMO graphics still seem to hold up and dificulty curve on moderate seems about right for someone that doesnt play many FPS. There were some difficult bits, but not to the level of fraustration. At the end of the game I found bit genuinly scary

My one gripe is that the mix between horror and FPS seems a bit disjointed, it was almost like 2 different games with noticable switching between the 2.

If you are into FPS with a bit of horror, this is definitly a good pick, but if you want all out horror, I would go elsewhere."
76561198190088671,1467840158,True,this game is dope
76561198297320950,1467834027,True,Very good game even for its age and has a really good story line to it
76561198246975216,1467767991,True,If your a fan of horror and shooters (unlike resident evil) then i very much recommend F.E.A.R.  There are some poop your pants moments makes the game worth a typical shooter.
76561198012217576,1467641212,True,"This game achieves what it sets out to do; Intimidate and terminate as you'll spend a fair amount of time tactically gunning your way through a plethora of relentless killing machines blocking your path. The horror in this game is done very well despite being old. However, there are cheap jumpscares that are used HOWEVER they are very small in quantity and aren't really that spooky but that isn't the most defining feature of the horror elements; it's the atmosphere that creeps you out the most. The environment contributes a massive part to the horror as well as even with visuals that are older than a decade it can still get you shivering and squirming to the point where you might need to call it a night and continue off the next day.

The gunplay is astonishing and the mechanics employed keep the game fresh and interesting as there is a sense of progression as bigger & better weapons are found later in the game as well as scarily strong enemies that enforce strategy and resource management, (e.g. use the 1-clip rocket launcher on a group of guys or save it for the colossal mechanical beast later on). The A.I in this game is truly mesmorising as groups of soldiers can work together efficiently and the lesser units will tend to protect the heavy of the group, resulting in a somewhat challenging firefight. However, these are fairly rare and once you understand how the units operate you can always predict what they'll do and more often than not you'll actually be right.

The bullet time is a great tool and the ability to further extend your joyful takeovers with 'Reflex Boosters' is a great addition to the game, the same can be said for 'Health Boosters'. Despite the usefulness of such tools it wont make you Rambo as the enemies can easily kill you just you can easily kill them. 

But there is one major issue I have with the game grouped with smaller issues and this is the fact that the difficulties aren't challenging enough even when on 'Masochist Difficulty'. Another issue I had is where weapons had disappeared once I had dropped them, at first I thought this was a simple bug and restarted but the issue persisted.

Nevertheless, F.E.A.R is a great FPS and offers an experience you wont forget with a brilliant story, some interesting characters (not all of them are that great to be fair) and top-notch gunplay. 

Highly recommended.

76561198119087489,1467475380,True,"Good old FPS game with long story. This is one of the best in 2000 era. It is not really that spooky now as compare to during year 2005. Now we are used to the blood and scary scenes from other titles released after year 201x.

One of the notable feature about this game is the slow-mo effect that you can do during gun fight. Basically it allows you to react faster than the your enemies. You can throw a grenade and try to catch it :)

My Total gameplay hours is 34 hours including expansion story. If you are good in FPS, you should be able to finish it in about less than 20 hours.

One of the best FPS games I know of. Great AI, interesting story and fantastic John Woo-esque and tactical gunplay. The game has a unique combat system which I wish today's developers would take a note or two of, the game puts you up against squads of 5 soldiers which communicate with each other and co-ordinate to try to take you down, which in higher difficulties can make the game genuinely difficult because the AI are extremely intelligent. As an example of such, during my playthrough I had to resort to taking cover in a room with open windows in which my enemies could see me through, instead of charging me head first like most modern FPS games AI would do, they actually had 3 of the 5 soldiers laying down suppressing fire and trying to flush me out with grenades, while the other 2 were trying to flank me, at the end of the gun fight I was flanked and killed due to the fact that I had no idea that the enemy were flanking my position. As a result of that gun fight I laughed my ass off because I hadn't been outsmarted in sooo long by AI and it was such a enjoyable experience. In my books F.E.A.R has the best AI I know of and still holds it's own even after 11 years, F.E.A.R is truly a masterpiece and I wish there were more games like it. The story of F.E.A.R is quite interesting but it is true that at times it can feel very drawn out but the visceral gun fights and atmospheric horror keeps you drawn in. It's a game that doesn't rely on jumpscares and forced perspective views to scare the player and I will admit that in my first playthrough I had some heart pumping moments which I won't spoil. All in all F.E.A.R is a great game to grab and for $9.99 USD it is a great deal, even for people that aren't fans of horror, I believe this is a game that every gamer should experience and it will forever be one of my top 5 FPS games."

The seemless transistion from action to horror is executed flawlessly, the're so many horror moments that you will miss the first time around and on second or third or even your eighth playthrough you will ask yourself ""have i seen that before?""  On max setting the game looks beautiful for a fifteen year old game and the reflex macanic makes you feel like a bad ass when you're blowing replica soldiers to chuncks of meat and clouds of blood or shooting one in the head with a shotgun and watching it pop off like a cork in slow motion, while the enemy are begging for back up or telling his peers over the radio that you wiped his whole squad out and he's alone. The AI arn't dumb either, if you got a flashlight on they will know your there instintly and it never gets old catching them off guard. health packs are pretty common and your health is like half life which has you being very cautious. Alma is the best part of the game, shes always there following you around like a lost puppy ready to take your breath and make you pee a little, she is truley the selling point of the game. Through all the action and explosions you will feel like there is not enough horror IN A GOOD WAY. Then you got the two extra full campains, extraction point and perseus mandate which i like more then the original because it feels like it has a little more horror elements mixed in. This game is one of my top five games and it will never get old, it just has that feeling that makes you wonder why there arnt any other games quite like it and F.E.A.R. will always have a special place in my heart.

I was getting sick of the constant jump scares in a lot of horror FPS games, and this was a refreshing pace of creepy with a dash of dark atmosphere.

The sound is design is a lot of pew pew pew at times. However, I really enjoyed the non-firefight sections due to the unsettling music, and little background noises. I got scared a few times from kicking a paint can (embarassing).

The plot is pretty basic (albeit pretty screwed up). I actually didn't mind listening to the random plot devices (radios, laptops, voicemails). They were short and sweet, so I wasn't standing around like an idiot waiting for it to complete. 

Gameplay is pretty fun. I had a lot more badass moments in this game than I expected. Activating slo-mo, throwing a grenade into a group of baddies, shooting said grenade. Pretty cool.

You can bicycle kick!

10/10 would bicycle kick a grenade again."

76561198045534868,1465818264,True,This game is an original horror but i wish there was co op would be so fun to rund around together then shit your pants when you see her. Pretty fun CS/Arcade style shoooter where you fight you way through an army whilse a ghost is haunting you. The game isn't as scary as some newer horror games due to their being heaps of enemies to shoot rather than having no weapons. Good classic to pick up and worth the price. Although sometimes i'm pre scared now 6.5/10

76561198074574184,1465543569,True,"I'm going to be real honest. This game is awesome. The sequels got a little off track at the end there, but the original F.E.A.R. was one of the best FPS's I've ever played.

It makes you feel like an absolute bad ass, and a little bitch all at the same time, and it does it well.

On harder difficulties the ememies get scary smart, and the use of both jumpscares (all over the place) and an overbearing sense of dread help to make this game a spooky experience as well.

Despite the lack of hours on steam, you gotta trust me when I say, this is one of the few FPS's that I've played countless times, and have enjoyed ever minute of.

Great fun, 8/10"
76561197970309035,1465226921,True,Nice intriguing fps !
76561198002245938,1465162809,True,"The first few scares may be just creepyface.jpeg, but if you can get through it you'll find a very creepy game that horror fans (even J-Horror fans) can enjoy. And it's also a top notch shooter to boot making it a must have for fans of either/both genres. Multiplayer may no longer exist but a 8-ish hour campaign that's thrilling and fun from start to finish makes up for it. A real shame that the same can't be said for the sequels (Well 3 most definitely)"
76561198055269636,1465034570,True,"Fear is a good average fps shooter with an average plot, the game is fun and entertaining and can be relaxing if played at lower levels of difficulty, but has few flaws:

Negative:

- No map or minimap or any directions of where you're supposed to go, while this is most of time not much a problem, in some point it was, making me lose a lot of minutes walking forward and back in the aim to find the right direction to go.

- Often enemies approach to you without any noise, i mean, in all games i've played, to know where the enemies are is very important, but these soldiers, too often (not always) make no noise with steps when they walk near you, so they could appear out of a wall and if you not have good reflexes you're shoot down.

- Perseus Mandate expansion is the best of the 2 expansions, has more longevity and better enemies, but its level of difficulty is insane, i had hard time to beat final boss, that was really insane and i've played one of lower levels, so ,considering there are 4, i think difficulty in this game is not well balanced. As last note, once you beat the game you unlock 3 additional missions that could have been fun to play if devs would not have decided that you cannot save the game (nor checkpoints works) while trying one of these, making the experience a lot frustrating and not fun.

- The AI of enemies is a little dumb ^^

Positive:

+ The AI of enemies is a little dumb ^^
+ The game is fun enough to play
+ The ability of slow the time while taking the aim is awesome and probably the best thing of this game (beware, this could seems optional but is not, if you not learn to use it always and try to face enemies without it you're going to die)

So i could recommend this game to both fps fans and average players cause will give you a decent amount of hours of fun.

My Final Score is

[h1] [b]75[/b] /100 [/h1]"

76561198020624548,1463459432,False,"F.E.A.R. is a standard first-person shooter that uses bullet time—that’s honestly all it is—which came as quite a surprise to me after reading the widespread reviews lauding it as one of the greatest shooters of all time. The plot is the typical what-has-science-done, with an Evil Corporation (as if there were any other kind in video games) in pursuit of engineering super soldiers. So a psychic military commander sends his puppet soldiers to take over Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) headquarters, a warehouse emporium of weaponry, medikits, and indestructible office equipment. Enter the nameless, mute protagonist, as part of a special army unit designed to face paranormal threats, and his squad mates, who are consistently separated, injured, and subject to all manner of contrived reasons to keep them from interrupting the solo FPS design. “You’re just going to send him in alone???” the radio crackled for the umpteenth time. 

The gunplay was praised again and again as being spectacular, but it’s just a typical FPS experience. F.E.A.R.’s own iteration of the arsenal with which any FPS fan is familiar functions exactly as expected, with one exception; kicking people is far more damaging than multiple machine gun rounds piercing through their torsos. The only distinguishing feature of the gameplay is its infinitely accessible bullet time mode, which trivializes every encounter throughout the entire game, even on the hardest difficulty. Shifting in and out of bullet time mid combat is pretty, but nothing near the level of mind-blowing so universally spouted from critics. It is by no means bad; it’s decent, but only that.

Enemy AI was next on the list of sheer adulation, and was claimed to be “some of the best AI in shooter history.” Imagine my surprise when armored soldiers, who make up 80 percent of the game’s enemies, loudly proclaimed through their megaphone helmets that they were throwing a grenade at me, which then detonated two feet in front of them. I don’t remember if any of them ever did manage to hit me with a grenade, but I do know they were constantly informing me of what they were going to do, or how many of them I had killed. And for some reason, whether I was hiding behind a box, retreating, or charging head on, they would constantly shout at me, “HE’S TRYING TO FLANK US!” It’s not their fault, I suppose; someone built their armor with megaphones in the helmets… but weren’t they supposed to be psychically coordinated soldiers?

I did begin to feel a certain attachment to these armored soldiers, for all their loud, bumbling ineptness. There were many times they could’ve had the drop on me, if only they had not shouted, “SHIT!!!” or something like that when they spotted me. At one point, an armored truck full of them tried to run me over, but when I moved out of the way, they just kept driving, right off a building. Sometimes one of them would shout to the other, “TAKE COVER!!!” to which the other, surrounded by hallways, doors, tables, and walls, would scream, “I DON’T KNOW WHERE TO GO!!!” I even started to let them have all the time they needed to awkwardly wiggle underneath fences or clamber over walls in plain sight of me before I gunned them down. 

Of course, no review of F.E.A.R. would be complete without mentioning the horror, something which critics across the board have deemed bowel-voidingly scary. But it just wasn’t. Throughout the game, several hallucinations occur that are supposed to be unsettling, but 99 percent of them can’t actually hurt you. With no real effect upon the player, and no way to interact with them, the visions take on a haunted house ride kind of feel—spooky happenings just outside the safety of a cart on tracks. I found myself startled once or twice upon turning around to see a little girl just behind me, but when I discovered that I could move toward and back away from her indefinitely to raise and lower the volume of the scary violins, I couldn’t help but laugh. 

The ever popular mechanism of discovered audio tapes takes the form of voicemails, but the majority of them are poor voice actors reading aloud passive aggressive corporate squabbles. They failed to flesh out the story to any further degree than what-has-science-done; the game as a whole never delivers on its narrative. Ambiguity is a useful tool in crafting horror, but F.E.A.R.’s story remains largely undeveloped by the end of the game. I think some developers wanted to make a standard action shooter but were also into Japanese horror films, so the result was a standard action shooter with Japanese horror elements that might as well have been delivered from a TV screen.

I will close with some of the non spoiler questions this game has left me to consider on my sleepless nights. Firstly, why do dead bodies sometimes randomly fly through windows, and why are there so many in the ceilings? ATC headquarters was taken over by psychically controlled soldiers, right? How did they even get the bodies up there in the first place? Or was it the little girl? Was she just stuffing them up through the tiles so they could conveniently fall down as I passed? And why does the protagonist spontaneously combust when he falls into pits? I did it several times out of disbelief, but sure enough, just before the screen went black, orange flames engulfed my entire body. What exactly are those shinless, tan men who float into me and pop like a fleet of suicidal balloons? And why do the armored soldiers sometimes blast off like rockets when I shoot them in bullet time mode? Machine gun fire shouldn’t send an armored body rocketing across a room, bouncing off walls and screaming.

The game is an incredible piece that blends FPS action and horror perfectly. Great atmosphere and story.

76561198068852662,1463312029,True,"[h1] F.E.A.R. [/h1]

[b]First impressions:[/b] Nice game. FEAR puts you in the pants of some spec-op guy who's trying to figure out what happened to a secret military compound. Your team gets in, and then...well let's just say that things go bad. Real bad. Highly-trained soldiers come at you and you gotta defend yourself fast.

[list]
[*][b]Genre:[/b] FPS (Doom-like)/supernatural themes. For a game this ""old"" it's still a very solid shooter.

[*][b]AI:[/b] quite good (sometimes enemy flankers try to encircle you while others are suppressing).

[*][b]Difficulty:[/b] intermediate (due to the presence of ""free"" bullet-time).

[*][b]Plot:[/b] not bad, but in my opinion it's not central, for it's rather stale. It doesn't really drive you towards the finale (actually it does but as for me it's not as good as the Half-Life saga), it's more a tell-tale of evil experiments (rather cliche).

[*][b]Atmosphere:[/b] definitely dark and makes you feel like walking inside a (suprise) huge haunted house. 

[*][b]Graphics:[/b]  While it would surely need a graphics-boost straight away, visuals are still appearing good.

[*][b]Audio:[/b] In my opinion it's one of the core factors in determining the eerie atmosphere that grows darker and darker as the game progresses.

 [*][b]FUN FACTOR:[/b] crazy shootouts and major firefights with bad guys (as you may imagine) it's the core of this game.
[/list]

 [*][i]Conclusion:[/i] although the plot is rather mild, graphics are slightly dated, the gunfights are still fun today. Definitely worth a playthrough if you're into supernatural shooters that focus on ""decaying"" atmosphere and, I dare say, a little claustrophobic spaces at times.

Thanks for reading."
76561197973141849,1463293349,True,Slow motion shooty game. What's not to like?
76561198013781501,1463261196,True,"When I was much, much younger, I went to a CofE primary school, and we sung hymns every morning. At the time, I hated it, but looking back, it was very good for me. One of my favourite hymns was ""Here I am, Lord"" by Dan Schutte. 

Now, F.E.A.R. is one of those games that pretends to be horror. Now and again the spoops come out, the hallway spins, ghosts and cute little girls whisper at you. Blood fills the screen. Fires. Screaming. Then it goes back to normal. The normal of F.E.A.R. is frankly fantastic gunplay, with a wide variety of weapons that each feel distinct and powerful. The single pistol can be used for sniping. The shotgun feels orgasmic. The HV Penetrator nails people to walls with 20mm pieces of rebar. The weird, scifi guns are a bit of a waste of time as you don't get too much ammo for them, but are nonetheless fun. 

The foes you fight are mostly five-to -seven man squads of highly competent soldiers. They try to flank you, communicate, supress you with fire, flush you out with grenades, and generally behave as soldiers hunting a highly armed and dangerous psyop would. It's a pleasure to fight against them as they actually pose a threat. Sure, they're easy to kill, but they put up a hell of a fight.  They communicate through shouting to each other, telegraphing movements, grenades thrown, whether *you've* thrown a grenade, and most importantly where you are. They even tell each other to retreat. 

Now, that snippet about hymns is relevant as one of the things they shout is WHERE SHOULD I GO!!? This is usually just before you kick them in the face so hard their head spins some 1240 degrees. And to that I answered, I HAVE HEARD YOU CALLING IN THE NIGHT- screaming, gunfire, robotic groaning- COVER FIRE- grenades- I WILL GO LORD, IF YOU NEED ME- crates falling-I WILL HOLD YOUR PEOPLE IN MY HEART. 

11/10 religious experience. 
Play on the hardest difficulty. It's worth it."

I grab it on Steam 80% sales with the whole series of F.E.A.R., I replayed it, and its still scared me, thats the point of the game, feel the FEAR of it. Too bad the official multiplayer part is already closed.

Trust me, its a great game! Grab it on Sales or maybe it will be free-play on weekend, who know? I give it 10/10."
76561198077262947,1463025545,True,"About a decade from now, a battalion of cloned supersoldiers and their commander, named Paxton Fettel, tear through a company called Armacham Technology Corporation for unknown reasons, butchering anyone in their way. You've recently been assigned as the Point Man of a group called F.E.A.R., a special forces team focused on combating the paranormal. Your main mission is to kill Fettel. Once dead, his army of soldiers will shut down. Additionally, you are forced to try and unravel the mystery of a paranormal presence in the form of a little girl. 

This original title scared the shit out of me. Absolutely scared the shit out of me. From the atmosphere, to hallucination sequences, to the girl herself. Could hardly take it. However, as scary as this game is, it's still labeled as a horror/shooter game, and you'll be doing a ton of shooting and walking around.

Visuals/Atmosphere: This game is 12 years old this year, and it still holds up fairly well. While lacking a vibrant color palette, the lighting and blood from the enemies gives it a decent look. On top of that something I overlooked for the first few playthroughs is how chaotic the fights in this game get. Smoke erupting after explosions, bloodstains all over the place, bullet holes and crap flying everywhere in the crossfire, it's amazing. On the horror side, this game does a really good job creating tension and suspense. Quiet voices, scurrying footsteps, people peeking around corners and fading out of sight; on top of that, whenever you are in a hallucination, its something you should be afraid of, and something that is also relevant to the story if you piece everything together. Another thing I commend this game for is its sound design. Yes, there are jumpscares, but more often than not what you experience in the game isn't a loud booming noise and a scary image that's supposed to surprise you. It's the simpler things, like silence that has no jumpscare and doesn't give you that release, shadows that have no owner when your back is turned to name a few that really stand out and the result, for me at least, is chills. I love it.

Story: In my recent review I can't believe I tried to brush off the story of this game. There is so much going on here and so much at work behind the scenes of the actual game to put together that it comes out to be a truly haunting, disturbing, and an altogether truly fucked up situation. See for yourself if you want to play the game it won't disappoint but I don't want to ruin any surprises for you players out there. Only things I'm gonna say; pay attention to the little girl and the things she says and does. There's a reason her presence is so destructive. There's a reason she to appears to you.

Gameplay/Pacing: These enemies are pretty awesome. Arguably the best AI in gaming history, Replicas will definitely give you a run for your money if you are playing on a high difficulty. Accurate, vocal, and deadly, these guys always fight in a squad. Not the waves idea where numberless hordes of enemies spawn and the idea is to overwhelm.These guys use their environment to their advantage: They'll take cover, issue comands to their allies, flush you out with grenades, the whole deal. The squads of enemies, although small, are formidable, but you are given a special trait to give you and edge in combat; slow-mo. For a set amount of time you can slow time and greatly improve your shooting ability, and dodging grenades or rockets. On the flip side, while the idea of squads is awesome and a nice change, it causes some problems with the way the game is paced out. There are a total of about 5 levels in the game, and the last level is the most varied and definitely the longest. However, the office section in the middle is nothing but endless number of cubicles and vending machines and its pretty painful. Aside from that not many complaints.

This game definitely is one of my favorites, great story, scary atmosphere and a formidable enemy army, F.E.A.R. will give you both scares and a good adrenaline rush.

EDIT:

Just finished Extraction Point, basically just a continuation of the main game. 2 new guns, some new levels, some rehashed. Pretty solid 5 hours for an expansion. 

Something I forgot to mention in the original review. The game runs fine at max settings at 60fps. For some reason, after some time playing, FPS drops to around 54fps. Quiting the game and restarting fixes it. Pretty weird. Happens in both the main game Extraction Point.

EDIT:

Busy playing Perseus Mandate and figured out that if you switch on ""Force Restart"" in the display settings, it reloads the video memory with ever start of the map, which stops the FPS drops. This take about 1 second and is well worth it.

EDIT:

Finished Perseus Mandate, solid expansion. Actually pretty long considering it only took about 2 hours more to finish the base game. 

In conclusion, the base game and the expansions are awesome, one of my favourites and highly recommended."

76561198038654065,1462232841,True,"My first experience with FEAR was way back in 2007. It was my friend, who iintroduced me to this classic. He bought it as a bundle with his new PS3. He said the reason he picked it up was beecause the cover looks cool, and it looks like ""some fun action FPS game where he can turn his brain off and relax"". until that is he played it and some quite creepy stuffs happening at first 30 minutes, looked back to the box art and realized there is a ghostly figure on top. and be like ""Well, damn, I guess I'm going to invite my friends, we're in for a thriling ride"".

And well, there I was, with 3 others, playing this game regularly on weekend, and I must say it was one of the most memorable and ""fun"" game I've ever played, all the screams, pauses, controller-dropping, and ""taking-a-fresh-air"" moments definitely leave a mark.

Now, 9 years later, revisiting the game. I'm surprised that F.E.A.R still managed to surprise me, not just with the horror part, but also the fact that it aged really well. It is still one of the scariest game ever, and the tightest, most solid shooting mechanic. And uh.. I'm out of introductory words, and it becomes quite lengthly at this point, so let's jump in.

[b]Story (9/10)[/b]

The story follows F.E.A.R, a special force, countering supernatural activity. In this operation, you are the Point Man, tasked to neutralize a psychic commander and his army who is gone rogue. Well, that's it. That's the  main plot throughout the entire game, and it remained it focus until the end. It's as simple as other action FPS, it doesn't try to be all grandiose, dramtic, and stuff, and that makes FEAR have a tight grip on it's story, focused, and well paced, carefully building up tension so it can reach a maximum impact at the end/  

[b]Gameplay (9.5/10)[/b]

A perfect blend between psychological horror, heavily influenced by Japanese horrors (or eastern horror in general). relying on disturbing imaginery and constant feel of uneasiness, and a really satisfying and tight shooting mechanic / action sequence, that combined with a REALLY intellegent A.I which will make combat feels more intense, tactical, and ""epic"" battles. The guns is your standard old school FPS arsenal: One type of handgun, shotgun, rifle  SMG, and some unique weapons. I particularly like The Penetrator, because reasons. Oh, and how can we forget SloMow / Reflex? One word. Badass. It's not just a gimmick. it's an esssential feature, the fast paced action sequence, mixed with numbers of enemies and level design that put you on disadvantage at later stages, you'll find yourself  on situations where you just have to go out of your cover and bicycle kick those fellas and blast the other ones' head with a shotgun afterward, 

[b]Sound (9/10)[/b]

Great voice acting, awesome soundtrack, and overall great sound design. Now, why I rate it so high despite my very minimal explanation? Because it's all comes down to this..

[b]Graphic (9.5/10)[/b]

If you feel like I left out many things on previous aspects, you are right, I do. Because everything comes down to this. Graphic, or more precisely atmosphere, this is what ties all aspects of FEAR together, the thing that makes it regarded as a classic. The atmosphere on FEAR is pitch perfect. Story, gameplay, sound, level design, all of it is build around atmosphere. And until this day, it's atmosphere is the one that makes it holds up even after 11 years. I will break down several aspect of it:
- ]Visual: The lighting was (and is) fantastic, great contrast between light and dark. The lighting alone is pretty unsettling, and with it's attenttion of detail and well thought out level design make even a well lit and neat offices doesn't  feel less disturbing than it's more messed up counterpart. And then we have the hallucination, which is simply mindfuckery and downright mental. Also, F.E.A.R might have what I like to call ""Half Life-tier level transition"", it's varied, smooth, and feelss natural. It also has a very nice stylized gore and slow-mo effects, it makes shooting someone with a shotgun in the head more satisfying (especially with the guns recoil, and sounds, make the weapons deliver a real punch when it hits)

- Sound: Cracking walls, child's laugher, rattling metal, and any sound effeccts that will plays out in the right place and time, that makes you question your sanity. Oh, can you guess how many times I got a mini heart attack when I accidentally kicking a soda can? It's 4. I counted. 

- Story: As you progress through, you'll find voice mails and intels scattered around ATC, and this is why I score the story highly. It's immersive, they told you only what you need to know at the moment, progressively revealing darker and more disturbing side of the story, as you moved to  the core of Armacham. 

[b]Overall (9.5/10) [/b]

FEAR and it's classic status is well deserved. A game that so ahead at it's time. A horror game that will send chill down your spine, that doesn't rely on cheap jump scares (I don't say there are none, it has it's moment of course, even that is quite clever), an action FPS game that make your adrenaline rushing, and a tactical game that actually demand you to think and plan before you drop your first bullet. A seemingly linear game by design, but it actually encourage some exploration to get some boosters (HP and reflex) and tactical advantage over enemies. Overall a timeless classic that even it's sequel fails to emulate.

[b]Short DLC Review: [/b]

Extraction Point (8/10):
- Story: ""I know, it doesn't make sense. Not much does anymore."" - Paxton Fettel.
- Gameplay: Same, fun gunfight, more gory, and more mental hallucination, especially the fifth interval, oh God the fifth interval. The new weapons are cool. Less explorable maps, and mostly a rearranged version of the first half maps of the base game.

Perseus Mandate  (6.5/10)
Uninspired. Could've been a really interesting side story, if it wasn't for the bland writing Why do it feels like I'm going through the last few intervals of the base game and the first few areas of Extraction Point again?"
76561198013594452,1462218962,True,"While I don't much like the action in this game, I don't find it as God awful or utterly unrealistic like FEAR 3. I feel disappointment when I hear enemies because it means that I have to go through some combat to get to the scares/story, but at least it's not horrendous or horrifically linear. At this point, the first FEAR game is a classic. It hasn't aged TERRIBLY well, but it hasn't aged TERRIBLY either. As long as you're not looking for the best of the best in terms of action, I'd say this game is worth picking up, especially because it leads to FEAR 2 which I consider to be the best of the series. Potentially the best game there is in the horror/action genre."

[h1]Exposition, Concurrence and Summation[/h1]
I missed this game when it originally launched back in 2005. For I had not yet joined the darkside. 

So being such a highly regarded game I felt I needed to go back and get familiar about this era for PC shooters. I was not disappointed. 

In this game you play as a grizzled special ops agent dubbed point-man and little is known about your character up front. All that is known is that he can slow down time however its explained pretty early on that this is because he has extremely good reflexes. Being the pointman of First Encounter Assault Recon or F.E.A.R. you are tasked with investigating a company for questionable practices and finding and extracting a few people.

This is a horror game and it definitely has its moments. Not entirely relying on jump scares but atmospheric tension as well. 

The game actually ages rather well if I do say so myself. Given a few grievances and lack of basic modern conveniences its still very playable. Health packs are still a thing and no iron sights. However this is replaced by storming into a room turning on reflex mode and mowing the entire room down with a shotgun. 

The story is also pretty interesting. I knew some things going in but the story is still engaging enough to see it through for additional exposition. 

All in all, I'm really glad I went back and played through something deemed “classic” and it held up over 10 years later. If you've not played this I HIGHLY recommend you go back and do so. Additionally the Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate expansions are included.

76561198053744908,1460665752,True,"When it comes down to it, the main reason you’re reading this is to determine whether F.E.A.R and its expansions are worth your time. Can a game which is over a decade old still hold up to today’s standards? 

FEAR (from this point on I’m ignoring the punctuated form) wants you to believe that it’s a horror slash first person shooter combo. Heck, the name, plot synopsis and cover art lead you to believe that you’ll be afraid to play it if you’re left alone in a dark room. Being generous FEAR comes across as a FPS punctuated with horror elements....things glimpsed out of the corner of your eye, a jump scare here and there and creepy monologues from the antagonist. The reason that it doesn’t truly convey the dread that it wants to is because plot wise FEAR feel s slightly empty. Initially it has atmosphere, but after the umpteenth generic corridor, followed by the same old office cubicles, that sense of foreboding begins to wear thin. Environmentally FEAR is repetitive with a capital R....at times mind numbingly so.
Story wise, Paxton Fettel, our antagonistic psychic terrorist, has escaped captivity and taken control of a small army of clone soldiers. He has then proceeded to aggressively takeover Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC), annihilate a Special Forces team and put on a special performance of Macbeth for his hostages(ok, maybe I was fibbing about of those things). And like it or lump it the FEAR team, or rather you, are given the task of eliminating that threat. 

The plot is mainly relayed through telephone voice mail messages and laptops scattered throughout the building, creating a fragmented picture of what is actually going on. Radio’s broadcast ongoing news of the attack and your team gradually fills you in on the patchwork of information that they have uncovered as the game progresses. The main problem with this is that it’s actually quite difficult to obtain a deeper insight into the back-story beyond the obvious plot thread (no spoilers here, but I had to read around the subject to learn more about what actually happened that were only had briefly hinted at in-game). In fact contrary to popular opinion, the most immersive point in the game (story wise), was a pseudo-escort section.....the most reviled of all gameplay devices actually makes the player feel connected to the game! Who’d a thunk it!!! 

However, what FEAR lacks in environmental variety and Shakespearean intrigue it makes up for in spades with its gunplay, SloMo mechanic and the enemy encounters. Whilst there is little in the way of breathtaking spectacle, FEAR’s encounters are memorable primarily because your enemies, the Replica Soldiers, display a degree of AI probably not expected in a game of this pedigree. Rather than blindly running into the fray, they cautiously engage and to underestimate them is to end up dead rather quickly. Their radio chatter adds to the sense of menace, and whilst after a while you’ll have hear d most of it more than a few times, the foes in FEAR actually go some way in creating that sense of jeopardy. Then there’s FEAR’s “unique” Max Payneian mechanic – SloMo. Our nameless protagonist has heightened reflexes that allow him to slow the world around him down to a crawl, whilst he is free to wreak havoc. “Point Man” can’t move faster, but he can aim and shoot whilst his opponents slow to a snail’s pace, and more often than not, toggling the SloMo on and off to create a balletic path of destruction will yield maximum results. In fact SloMo is strangely addictive, jumping up to flying kick a soldier and then shooting his partner with your shotgun, as you then spin to decimate the rest of the group is satisfying in a marvelously visceral way. And it’s there that FEAR holds its trump card. The gunplay borders on sublime....assault rifles actually feel like they pack a punch, dual wielding pistols is curiously fun, the sniper rifle feels deadly and the shotgun.....oh the shotgun. FEAR’s shotgun is a work of art...enemy’s blossom into clouds of red mist, splitting into pieces as you run like a crazy person into their number. FEAR’s weaponry feels just right, and your opposition don’t just soak up damage never to fall....these guns actually pack a punch (although conversely don’t expect to be let off making a mistake as you’re liable to die very quickly if caught out in the open).   And then there’s the environmental destruction, walls become pockmarked, blood sprays everywhere, grenades emit a visible blast zone. It almost becomes fun to see how much damage you can cause with your weapons during each face-off.

So, great gunplay, good enemy AI, nice long campaign which is a bit repetitive and a running undercurrent of plot.....does it hold up today? Probably; if you can tolerate a bit of repetition then FEAR is definitely worth a run through. But hold that thought, as that’s excluding the expansions that you’ll also receive as part of this package. The first, Extraction Point, is a straight on continuation of the main game (non-canon however as these expansions were handled by different developer, TimeGate Studios rather than Monolith). Taking the final sequence of FEAR and running with it ultimately it’s more of the same with the addition of a couple of new weapons. Does it break anything? No. Does it significantly add or change anything? Again, no. So if the main game worked for you and you were after more of the same then Extraction Point will fill that need. The plot is an interesting sideline but ultimately you know what you’re getting.  Perseus Mandate mixes things up a little with a different protagonist (not that you’d notice of course) enhanced enemies, more use of companion characters (Steve Blum, loving your work!) and more new weapons. It actually boasts a couple of creepy moments that seemed more absent from Extraction Point, and rounds out some of the finer plot details. Added to that the game features some bonus time attack arenas to give the player a tad more challenge, and as a result Perseus Mandate actually feels like a solid way to end the first FEAR “series”.

Given that you understand the shortcomings of a set of games that are around a decade old, FEAR and its two add-ons are around 20 hours of fun. At times yet another grey corridor/office room will make you want to scream, but persevere and you’ll experience the joys of one of the best shotguns ever conceived in game form."
76561198049701098,1460614270,True,"First Encounter Assault Recon, better known as F.E.A.R., is a cult classic title that is now over a decade old. Originally released in 2006 on Xbox 360, 2007 on Playstation 3, and 2005 on PC DVD, the game puts you in the role of a nameless F.E.A.R. Operative who is assigned the task of evaluating how, and why, the team that was sent in previous to infiltrate an aerospace compound was obliterated. Little did anyone know that such a malevolent, paranormal force would be the root cause. This title was finally released on Steam in 2010, much to the excitement of its cult following.

With over 3,000 positive reviews on Steam alone, it's impossible to deny that the game is a real hit with audiences. I remember back in 2006 when the game first released, I had a difficult time finding a physical copy for my 360; when I finally found one, housed in a battered case and without a booklet, I felt like I had found a holy grail of some sort. I popped it into my console, and had to stop only a few levels in due to just how badly the game scared me despite having played games such as Silent Hill 2 and 3, and many of the Resident Evil titles. I never finished it back then, so I set out to do so now, and to see how much the horror stacked up with today's standards.

The main story centers around a small girl of about 8 years old named Alma Wade. You discover her origins, along with your own, throughout the campaign. However, the narrative is hard to follow at times and can become quite confusing until much later in the 12 chapters, known as Intervals, that you will play through. There are phones throughout the game that you can check for voicemails, as well as laptops that are scattered about which house bits and pieces of information that is essential to piece together the primary plot. Your character will also be subjected to hallucinations, which are the primary source of terror in this action-horror hybrid.

F.E.A.R. has this overwhelming atmosphere to it, and it's primarily driven by both the dynamic, eerie lighting effects and creepy, unsettling soundtrack. As far as horror games are concerned, this one has one of the absolute best soundtracks that I can recall. The musical score ranges from subtle ambiance, cinema quality horrorscapes, and rushing, adrenaline infused beats. It changes as consistently as the tone of the game itself, which can go from slow terror to fast action in the blink of an eye. However, that fact can also be used as the only real downfall of the game. Each time you are set up for a truly terrifying experience, the title turns around and throws a slew of enemies at you right afterward instead of letting you enjoy the scares. 

The game does have its fair share of gore driven, blood soaked sections that will cause your heart beat to increase, but by today's standards of horror, the actual scare factor of F.E.A.R. has not aged well. While I remember white-knuckling the controller back in 2006, I have to admit that I didn't feel anything but the intensity of the action sections ten years later. I also recognized so many areas where they could have utilized the horror aspect of this game, where instead they chose to have either nothing or a small army of foes. Graphically, the game has aged incredibly well; it even looks better than a lot of indie titles that came out just last week. Two of the major selling points for F.E.A.R. back in 2006 were the dramatic lighting effects, which are still gorgeous to look at today, and the well-boasted about enemy A.I. Surprisingly enough, I'd forgotten how in-depth the enemy A.I. is in this game, and it has also held up well over the years and even surpasses many current gen titles. 

During this modern age, F.E.A.R. has unfortunately ran into a slew of performance issues. During my 5 hour playthrough, I had to restart my game every 8-11 minutes because the framerate would drop from 200+ (or 60, if I had V-Sync enabled), to 11-12. The game would stay at this low rate until it was rebooted. I also had to turn off Steam Overlay to even achieve more than 12 FPS. HOWEVER, there are now apparently fixes for this problem, so I have changed this review from a thumbs down to a thumbs up. Other people are experiencing crashing issues, although the only one that I had was when the game initially booted up and tried to auto-configure performance options. Other than these major issues which have obviously come with OS and software advancement, the game runs great and is flawlessly optimized; it'll even run at 4K resolution without a hitch.

All in all, F.E.A.R. has aged like a fine wine or whiskey, and it's still definitely worth playing today; just not on PC if you want to get the most out of the immersion it has to offer, though now there are some potential fixes to the framerate issues that are present. If you don't mind the possibility that you may be one of the many who are now experiencing crashing, then I'd recommend picking this one up during a Summer or Holiday sale. Otherwise, scour the bargain bins or local used game shops to find it on your console of choice. As well, don't go in expecting to be scared stiff, as us gamers have experienced far scarier titles in the last decade. The action, immersion, and story are still well worth being ensnared by.

That all being done and said, and as much as I love the series, it just isn't really scary to me. It definitely feels more like an action game with a spooky setting rather than an actual horror game.

Decent expansion, adds new weapons and enemies to the game, as well as a secondary story that follows the timeline of the original game.

 Action is more frequent in this game than the first one, you'll be continously fighting enemies which is great for the first 4 hours of the game, though it becomes repetitive near the end of the game. The horror elements are a bit underused, though are used well when they appear.

Graphically, the game is looking quite dated. It uses the LithTech engine which the original game used. The game doesn't look awful, and if you like great lighting this game is for you. Really cool use of shadows and lighting add to the horror. When the bullets start flying the game looks awesome, especially with slo-mo on, with sparks and dust flying all over the place.

The singleplayer section is around 6-7 hours in length, with there being a few bonus missions available after finishing the main campaign. There was multiplayer available, though unfortunatley the servers have been shutdown (The game is around 9 years old.) From what I played of it back in the day, I found it pretty fun to play. Standard deathmatch and CTF modes were included.

Overall, Perseus Mandate is worth your time and money in my opinion. If your a fan of the original and the sequels, you'll like this. Fans of horror and First person shooters will like it too.

76561197960693835,1459130542,True,"My Bite Sized Review - F.E.A.R.

The Good:
+Shooting gameplay shows it's age but is still satisfying
+Slow-Mo mechanic works really well
+A good variety of guns to use
+Game blends action and horror well
+Levels are dark and sometimes legitimately spooky
+Story gets more interesting near the end of the game and finishes with a cool finale


The Bad:
-You are fighting a clone army, enemies are all the same (except near the very end of the game)
-Levels are mainly bland - offices, sewers, warhouses, science labs - gray walls and explosive barrels pretty much sums it up
-There are 3 - 4 times were you as the character get up or exit a car with smooth first person animation, it is not used enough though
-The story is pretty boiler plate until the end of the game
-Other characters are not used enough and should have had more to do with the story
-Multiplayer is officially dead unless you use 3rd party software
-Oddly large disk space ???? 17GB for a game this old?


The Verdict:
I actually really enjoyed my time with this game. As a fan of the original half life and games after it, this game blends horror, matrix style slow motion, and first person level puzzles really well. I also really like the last hour of the game where the story picks up and stuff starts flying off the rails. My biggest knock against the game has to be that for 6 - 8 hours you kill clone soldiers, which can get pretty boring if you are expecting new enemies and tactics like those found in other games. 

To tell you all the truth though, if this game was 4 - 6 GB, I would keep it installed and maybe play it once a year, I thought it was really that good and it has that charm. But for some reason, this game with it's sub par graphics and only 8 hour campaign is damn near 18 GB (the same size as a 60 hour RPG or MMO), and as soon as I noticed that I knew I needed to uninstall it to make room for other games. I recommend it though."
76561198027860270,1459124777,True,"Great gunfights, great A.I (not perfect but still one of the best I played against) and a well-done horrific ambiance."
76561198080700676,1459122321,True,Quite a good shooter
76561198140808703,1459104949,True,"One of the best FPS singeplayer experiences I've had. F.E.A.R.'s like the wierd lovechild of a John Woo action movie and a J-Horror ghost story, it's a combination that shouldn't work but it does.

So first thing's first: you can slow down time for an edge in combat. This is awesome as the game also allows for diving sideways through the air with a pistol in each hand like a bonafide badman and delivering mid-air roundhouse kicks to your enemies' faces. Very, very satisfying.

However this feeling of empowerment is offset by the fact that this is a tough game because of:

The second thing: the enemy AI in F.E.A.R is incredible, it puts more recent shooters' whack-a-mole bots to shame, these guys work together as squads to bring you down, flank, use grenades and do the unexpected. Other enemies like cloaked assassins, mechs and ghouls add some variety but the real stars of the show are the replica soldiers, seemingly generic grunts elevated to memorable bad guys by the excellent squad tactics they employ.

Third thing: F.E.A.R has decent sci-fi/horror story and some good characters you'll be itching to kill but what it has in spades is atmosphere, action and spookiness aren't typically good bed-fellows but F.E.A.R does a damn good job of sowing an atmosphere of dread between its shoot-outs. It's not going to make die-hard horror fans crap themselves but it'll definitely set you on edge.

Visually it's dated overall but seeing bullets ripple through the air and debris and viscera bloom into slow-mo clouds of carnage still looks really cool and brings a feeling of heft to every shot you fire. The lighting's very well done and the sound design (incl. music) is great.

To sum up: Monolith had a very different, esoteric vision for this game and their execution of it is brilliant, it needs to be experienced. The combat is spectacular, the bullet time, the AI and the weightiness of every shot come together to make absolutely brilliant gameplay.

Highly recommended."
76561198185339862,1459099151,True,"Very great game, actually scared me like 5 times already, and it's decently hard to scare me. So I give a huge bravo to this game.. Though it is an older game, and the graphics aren't pretty, (though I don't know much people who care about graphics that much) this game I would definetly recommend. It's really worth your ten bucks, and you even get some DLC's."
76561198007197608,1459034715,True,"An awesome FPS that still shines years after it first came out. The enemy AI is honestly better than most games released today, the environment is scary and really does a good job of creating the game’s atmosphere and the mystery of the story alone is enough to keep you playing. 

Any FPS fan should be willing to shell out the pennies that Steam is charging for F.E.A.R., you won’t regret it!"

It isn't scary to me but I did enjoy the story and all.
I am so looking forward to continue this story in the next game as the combat is so far still awesome.
I do enjoy the enemies as they do try and flank you or just charge you or being sneaky bastards!

I do for sure recommend this game as the action and story in this game is really good.
As always I do recommend play at the highest difficulty. Makes the combat so much more enjoyable in my opinion.

"
76561198255306085,1458327495,False,"This isn't the worst game ever. But it certainly isn't one of the better games I've played. I went into F.E.A.R. with high expectations, because almost everyone was saying that this game was amazing. But, and I'm NOT sorry to say, I was rather disappointed with this game.

The gameplay isn't anything special. The gunplay is actually pretty bad. There are games much older than this, such as the Half-Life games, with much better gunplay, and the slow-motion just gets repetitive after a while. Put simply, walking through corridors and shooting the same soldiers in slow-mo every few minutes gets old pretty fast.

The level design is some of the laziest I've ever seen. Nothing but dimly-lit grey corridors. And that's your lot!

Then, there's the story... Or lack thereof. Throughout the game, I had no freaking clue what was going on or what I was fighting for. The game makes no clear explanation as to what you're doing, or why. You're just placed in these random places and shoot shit, with the occasional paranormal... thingie that comes out of nowhere. There is ZERO narrative!

None of the characters were even remotely memorable. Most of them only make appearances that last mere minutes. I only remember one name, Norton Mapes. As for the main character, he was just some generic mute. Nothing more, nothing less.

Also, this game is pretty short! I managed to beat it in less than ten hours. And this was a full-priced game at launch? Inexcusable.

The one thing I give this game credit for though is the enemy AI. For a game from 2005, the enemy AI is top tier. The soldiers react almost instantly to your presence, even at small things like your flashlight, and their accuracy is pixel-perfect. They don't miss a single shot at all! But that's just about the only thing this game has going for it, really.

Overall, I think this game is seriously overrated. It's gameplay wasn't anything special, the story was crap, and it was ridiculously short. But I have played worse. It isn't horrible, but it certainly hasn't aged well and I wouldn't play it again."
76561198123218259,1458275691,True,This game needs to be controller compatible.
76561198161141911,1458261408,True,"Its both my favourite first person shooter game of all time and my favourite horror game of all time. It's pretty much a fact that this game has the best artifical intelligence ever in an fps.
The best word i can use to describe the shooting is beefy. The guns feel so powerful and it's a feeling that only a few games get right. The AI reacts to your every move and try to counter it it's so well done. It's not the scariest game of all time but the reason why its my favourite horror game is because of how clever and memorable the scares are and some of them will make first time players jump out of their seat.
10/10 (Masterpiece)

The DLC's however are nowhere near as good as the original game. They are cheap cash ins on the original games success. They were created by timegate studios, a company that have never made a good game. It lacks the quality of the original and they just feel like cheap knock offs. They ruined the story of the series so much to the point where monolith says they are not cannon. The scares are cheap and not effective and feel very rushed. The gunplay is mostly the same as the original but are nowhere near as fun because of the lack of good level design and enemy placement. However i still think fans of the original should at least play through them once because the amazing mechanics are still the same it just lacks the quality. It does bring more challenge with new but more annoying and less fun enemy types so theres that."
76561198050451192,1458187843,True,After playing F.E.A.R back in 2005 along with the rest of series when they released I have to say this is a MUST PLAY! Even over 10 years later this game can still scare the hell outta me. Alma is one of my most Loved and most Hated characters of all time.(Hated her due to the nightmares she gave me when i was younger) I feel my old nostalgia of this amazing game back. Just when you le your guard down due to mowing down countless enimies thinking thats all you have to deal with... Theres Alma standing in the corner. All in all BUY THIS GAME!

76561198027947201,1457676048,True,"This review will include the main game, and it's expansions, as they don't have their own store pages.

F.E.A.R.

Gameplay is awesome, guns have lots of weight to them, and you feel like a powerful badass. Gameplay feels kind of mix of Half-Life and something else. Level design is quite similar to first Half-Life game, and It made this even more enjoyable for me. I remembered fear as a horror game with shooter elements, but replaying it now i appreciate it much more. It's damn good shooter. Slo-mo is fun, and useful in hard situations. Game took me 4,5h beat on easy. HLTB says average is over 8 hours, so i guess that difficulty made the game quite a bit shorter.


F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point

Continues the main games story, and picks up straight where the campaign ended. If you graved for more, this will satisfy you quite well. Took me about half the time compared to main game, so good value for an expansion! New guns, new story etc.


FEAR: Perseus Mandate

Second expansion, where you play a different character at the same time the main game took place. You are part of second F.E.A.R. team. This one was more of the same, with even more new weapons. Some new enemies, and new story as well. 

Overall, Game and it's expansions are quite damn enjoyable shooters with some horror elements. If you don't like horror, it should not be that big of a problem, the game is shooter, and the storyline is part horror."
76561198025398275,1457458402,True,"It may seem morbid but killing enemies in F.E.A.R. is remarkably gratifying and the highlight of the entire experience. This is thanks to weapons that feel and sound impactful while also being incredibly fun to use; combined with the numerous amount of visual effects, an ideal bullet time feature and a satiating gore system to provide gleeful carnage of the highest calibre. The horror elements mesh with the rest of the game quite fittingly and serve up a few intense moments. Sadly, it isn't without its faults, mowing down droves of the exact same enemy type through excruciatingly dull and repetitive environments is an effective way to deafen the positive notes of your game.

As for the expansion packs, they are monotonous and unimaginative, only recommended for hard-core F.E.A.R. fans.

7/10"
76561197995319891,1457415398,True,"Is it scary? No. Is it creepy? Kinda. Is the shooting fun?

I don't know what it is about the shooting, but it just feels so visceral. Especially during bullet-time, every shot has weight. The guns are loud and impactful- something I feel is missing from lot of games these days. The enemies flinch and react to your shooting, and they don't just slump over dead- they die screaming, exploding, firing off a last gasp of bullets in their death-throes. It's not a wacky-fun ride like Bulletstorm tries to be, but the shooting has enough of an impact to keep the game fun.

The level design deserves a special mention. It's nothing beautiful, but it's very open ended. There are multiple paths and hidden secrets filled with goodies for the scavenging. It rewards exploration. This allows allows enemies to be very, very smart.

I don't know why, but the AI in this game feels fantastic. They actually work together as a team, having some units flush you out with grenades while others wait for you to react, or have a single individual rush your position, forcing you to move. They often try to flank you by going around the non-linear paths, and have a good bit of variety to them.

If you want a horror game, don't buy this one. It's not horror. It's a shooter that sometimes puts on a haloween mask and goes ""boo."" If you want an unapologetic shooter filled with violence and hard, satisfying guns, pick this one up.

(Also there's a generic framerate issue you can fix by disabling all HID-compliant devices in your device manager. It's an issue with logitech.)"

The shooting feels tight, the slo-mo is oh-so satisfying to use, the guns feel like they have incredible punch to them, and everything gets destroyed. Just about everything in the game either has crazy physics or emits a particle effect when hit, so entire building floors become decimated as you work your way through the game. The A.I. employed by the enemies is miles above most modern FPS games. Fights end up feeling so dynamic that repeat playthroughs just to see ""what if I do this..."" are highly encouraged. 

Not everything is perfect; environments and enemies lack visual and mechanical variety, some of the in-game textures and artwork are clearly stuck in 2005, and I found the environments a bit confusing to navigate at times.

A review by Richard Valkinsenn.

""What's the first thing you remember?""

F.E.A.R. is, hands-down, one of the best single-player action experiences out there. While the game's visuals have dated horrendously, it's overall gameplay has aged incredibly well. 

There's a unique blend of action and horror on display in the game's narrative, balancing and often mixing both effectively and memorably. The game's action is brutal and relentless, though its frenetic, lengthy, and heavily stylized firefights are broken up by short breather sections in-between, so the action never feels tiring. It also strangely never becomes repetitive, even though you'll be seeing a lot of the same environments throughout the game. 

Fear is the name of the game, both literally and figuratively, and the game features high amounts of genuine creepiness before, after, and even during it's insane action sequences. In fact, the game seems to pay homage to Japanese horror with it's atmosphere and it's chief antagonist resembling Samara from ""The Ring."" And thankfully, the game's creepiness relies more on the building of atmosphere instead of cheap ""jump"" scares, though, admittedly, whatever of these scares there are in the game are very well-timed.

Overall, F.E.A.R. boasts a unique blend of action and horror that combines seamlessly and effortlessly into one unique and memorable package that still delivers.

Final Verdict:
I (still) love it.

Few franchises manage to nail their design on the first try and FEAR is among the outliers. Sadly its sequels while respectivley good and decent (FEAR 2 and FEAR 3) couldnt live up to to this spectacular first outing.

Half life, Doom, Halo, FEAR

FEAR is the seminal PC shooter. Displaying exactly the dominance of this genre on the PC and playing to the platforms strengths.

Originally released in 2005 FEAR is a looker in 2016 with a striking style that puts its most developed visual assets to the forefront. While no longer a piece of cutting edge tech FEAR displays exactly the type of strong design that will top modern efforts when given the attention it deserves.

It took me about 9 hours to finish the main campain.

The heavy atmosphere (creepy game sounds, soundtrack and weird flashings), the varied combat styles (gun play, melee combos and flying kicks), and everything else, makes me love this game. 

The graphics are outdated, but while you're running and gunning your way out of trouble while running from little girls you barely notice this game is older than you (jk).

The plot was interesting but I kept finding it humorous that you're supposed to be part of this elite team yet you never see any help from allies. There was a lack in weapon variety, but the weapons that were there felt ""right"" and not too broken or useless. Overall, definitely worth a playthrough."

It can get a little repetitive in places but the story and environments trundle along quite nicely.  

Single player took me around 8-9 hours.  Worth a couple of quid of anyones money especially if you enjoyed the Half Life series."

These guys know how to make a damn horror game for sure.

This is not one of those, -you don't have a weapon, run like crazy when in danger- games that unfortunately exist recently.You do have a weapon in this game, however; it's not a sole shooter game, nor something that jumpscares you every second.In my humble opinion, everything is really super balanced in its own way.It did not bore me by making me shoot guys for a long time or leave me thrilled for a long time.

Moreover, this game has one of the best artificial intelligences.I do not want to mention more about it, so you can be surprised in the game.And, I will not mention about the story, now that everyone's aware of it.

Lastly, I think that you should play its expansion packs too.In this series, except the 3rd game ----> 2nd game, 1st game and its expansion packs were made by precious Monolith.EPs are as good as the game itself by the way.I strongly recommend this."

76561197982486331,1453853732,True,"This is one of my favorite shooter titles with a singleplayer campaign.  I can do without the Multiplayer, to be honest.  There's never really been a big shortage of shooters, and I think other multiplayer ones do it way better.

However, the singleplayer action is fun, loud and visceral.  My only big complaint is it doesn't feel like there's enough to kill.  With Reflex Time, which causes you to be able to move much quicker than everyone else, you can decimate and wipe entire squads with only your hands and feet if you choose.

Though the graphics probably aren't impressive at all by today's standards, when this game launched, the lighting system was one of the best.  The story is also told almost entirely through gameplay with only a minimum on scenes you can't control.  Though the story can't be altered (it's not an RPG), you can miss bits of it if you don't explore the levels.  Exploring offices, finding laptops and listening to voicemails are how you piece together various story bits and finding them all really fleshes out the story and brings a little life to the various NPCs involved.

What makes playing through a few times fun is all the various ways you can kill the enemies.  Sometimes stealth is possible, melee attacks are strong, precision pistol shots, making red mist with the shotgun, making pin-up art with the Penetrator, creating skeltons and scattering body parts across rooms with traps.  The game really needs a never-ending survival mode because combat is extremely fun, and is easily the best part of the game.

To me, this game is a classic."

The use of lighting and shadows to play trickery was great, the fire-fights that kick up dust and create a battle-fog allowed moments of unease as I waited for it to settle. The sheer satisfaction of nailing soliders to walls with the nail-gun never got old, and I shat my pants on more than one occassion with Alma creeping about and appearing next to me randomly. Although I enjoyed this game, I hated the Norton Mapes segments, and I hated how they broke the scares up with his antics and the stupid music they played during these sections. But other than that weird jolt between scares, I loved this game."

Its atmosphere is its greatest strength and the devs absolutely nailed it. The whole atmosphere of the buildings, offices, corridors, lighting, level design, enemies, and sounds perfectly creates a great feeling of DREAD, ISOLATION, and FEAR that keeps you on the edge and hooked to complete the game. Its atmosphere was way far ahead for its time and it still currently holds up as one of the greatest atmospheres in video game history along with Bioshock, S.T.A.L.K.E.R., and Layers of Fear. 

Another huge plus about this game is the A.I. of all the enemies. They are one of the best programmed and intelligent enemies I have ever seen. The combination of the A.I. and bullet time manipulation is insanely bonkers which provides you some of the greatest gameplay experiences in gaming. 

The execution of using sounds and music with the action and well-written story was perfectly well done which gave me a tremendous feeling of terror. I cannot figure out how the heck the devs managed to do this part so well. You need to play this game to fully understand that.

Overall, the game is a must play and is my second favorite game of all time.

76561198045248718,1453102989,True,"I have never played F.E.A.R. before, but when I saw the game for $2.50 a while back I had to pick it up and put it in my backlog. Now that I've completed the series I'm writing reviews for each game.

Performance/Graphics:
Tons of video/advanced options available and the game is not intensive at all with current hardware. You'll more than likely be able to crank this game to 11 and enjoy it at butter smooth 60fps(or higher) with no drops whatsoever. Of course the graphics are dated at this point, but for a game that is over 10 years old at this point it holds up pretty well.

Extra Content/DLC:
The extra content is ""worth it"" if you end up liking the game and want more backstory. Technically the extra content isn't ""canon"" so if you're looking for more canon backstory then don't bother, but if you just want more to play then go for it. I personally did not play the DLC so I can't comment on them performance/combat wise, but I did read the wiki about the plot for them and I'd say they're both great additions.

Combat:
The game itself has very good weapon mechanics and varying weapon choices, also it has armor and health management, so use your medkits wisely and look for armor pickups when needed! You can hold four weapons at once and various grenade types. Fighting is fluid and the slow-mo(bullet time) the game features is a nice touch and it really helps when things start getting hectic, or if you want to see explosions in slow motion.

Atmosphere:
There is a horror atmosphere to the game and plenty of jumpscares/scenes that will make your heart skip a beat and body tense up. Definitely turn off the lights, put on a pair of headphones, and play at night to really make your skin crawl. Or don't and play in the middle of the day like a sissy, your choice not mine.

Story:
The story itself is interesting and definitely makes you wanting more. I'm not posting spoilers, but I can guarantee you this game has a great story behind it and is definitely worth a play.

Price:
Like I said I got this game and it's two DLC's for $2.50 a while back. For $9.99 I'd honestly consider woth picking up, at $4.99 definitelty pick it up, and if you see it for $2.50 you're definitely missing out big time if you don't buy it at this price point."
76561197979592167,1453096353,True,best fps ever...?
76561197999561308,1453067189,True,"What can i say about this game? The story and the gameplay is just fantastic. Ive really enjoyed playing  F.E.A.R and its stand-alone expansion packs.  I love it when you can dive in these action scenes  and finish off  the replica soldiers, mercs, nightcrawlers etc in style, as if you are a well-trained supersoldier.  For a fairly old game it does have clever enemies. For instance  if the enemies  see you they scatter arround the place. Some enemies find cover and try to flush you out or keep you pinned down  so that others try to flank you. 

Then you have this horror-movie like atmosphere in these games where you enter a bloody building and you dont know who or what is waiting for you around the corner on every floor.  To be honest i didnt feel like  F.E.A.R and  F.E.A.R Extraction point was scary.  F.E.A.R Perseus mandate did have a pretty good scary atmosphere and there were a  few parts in it that scared the shit out of me, like for instance one time when i was  loading stuff in to my inventory and I didnt realize that something was waiting behind me for me to turn around.  

Ive spotted two minor issues but in my opinion they are not that critical. 
When you enter a scene an intense music starts to play, this gives the player the signal that there is going to be a battle. when you win the battle the intense music keeps playing and this is kinda confusing because it gives me the idea that there are some additional enemies who are going to barge in any moment when there arent any. The intense music stops when you enter a diffrent area and this issue happend only a few times in the games. 
The second small issue is , there was one time when the game is done loading  the next level, it knocked me back to the main menu with an message ""server disconnected"".
I dont know why it did that but this happend in my experience only once in the games Extraction point and Perseus mandate. Luckily you can bypass this problem by lowering your game settings and re-configure them back when the next level is loaded.

 Like i said before F.E.A.R. and its stand-alone expansion packs are fucking awesome. Its worth the money and  im glad i have them in my library."

Completely stands up regarding presentation even though its been a decade. Overall this is a must play for fans of the genre.

76561197974707623,1452806429,False,"F.E.A.R.: I’m not F.E.E.L.ing it…

When F.E.A.R. came out back in 2005 it was considered to be a game changer! Not on the level of Half-Life 2 or anything, but, people loved it! They always talked about how good it was. The horror elements were well done, the enemy AI was fantastic, the shooting was super great, and the graphics were amazing. You had to have a pretty beefy computer to play this game.

Maybe back in 2005. Because, man has this game aged poorly. Like, really poorly.


Not only does the game look... bad. It’s really not that fun either, sorry to say. Now this is probably due to the fact that I have ten years of games between the release of F.E.A.R. and now to compare it to. I can definitely see how, at the time, F.E.A.R. would have blown my thirteen year old mind. But as it stands, in 2015, F.E.A.R. is very underwhelming. It feels like a pretty standard shooter, with some cool bullet time and horror elements thrown in. 

I’m sure if I could force myself to play more I would probably get something out of it. But as of four hours into the game all I’ve done is: run through long hallways murdering puppet soldiers in an industrial complex, and an office building, while occasionally being frightened by a little girl. And... she doesn’t show up all that much, sadly.

To be fair, there were moments where I was genuinely enjoying myself. Rolling up on fools with a shotgun and slo-mo sliding into them while tearing them to shreds with buckshot is really cool. Like the first 50 times. Then it just becomes an easy “I win” button. Now, the horror aspects of this game were the main draw for me. And trust me, they can be genuinely disturbing and definitely made me jump more than once. But, as you play through the game you can see the seams at the edges of the experience. After about two hours I could tell when the game was going to go from ‘action’ to ‘horror’ just by level design.

Big well lit area funneling into a small dark hallway? Scare incoming. Better turn on my flashlight!

Eventually I just got bored with the game. There wasn’t enough of the creepy to keep me interested, and the ten year old shooting and level design weren’t doing F.E.A.R. any favors.

I honestly spent a large chunk of my four hours trying to figure out where the hell I was supposed to go. Which is the weird thing, because this game is quite linear. Sadly it’s very easy to get turned around, and everything looks the same… Plus sometimes the level designers expected you to intuit where to go without any indication. I felt like I was playing Duke Nukem, or Doom, considering how many times a seemingly decorative A/C vent was actually the way forward. 

I hear this game gets pretty crazy towards the end, but I can’t bring myself to continue any further. I wanted to try and complete every game I reviewed for this project… but, I don’t really want to spend anymore time on this one. Especially considering I have over one hundred more to do.

I think the coolest part of F.E.A.R. is probably the firefights. Although the shooting is rather lackluster compared to today, the effects of your combat are really cool. Glass will break, the walls, floor, and ceiling will have large chunks blown out of them. And large amounts of dust, that actually lingers, will be kicked up. It forces you to move around, and looked really cool. Plus the bloody aftermath was always satisfying...

The dust tech is the most impressive part of this game to me. Seriously.

Honestly, this game reminds me a lot of Psi-Ops, an old game for the PS2. It revolved around a paranormal military task force fighting against another paranormal military group. It had all of the same hyper violence, weird psychic powers, creepy horror segments, and strange meat puppet soldiers. Expect I played it at the time... so I liked it.

It’s not that FEAR is bad… It’s just like an old movie. It was amazing when it came out! It’s just, going back and looking at it compared to ‘modern’ releases, it just doesn’t hold up.

Luckily I picked F.E.A.R. up on sale for like $2.75. If you’ve never played FEAR and always wanted to. Watch a let’s play. Or, if you absolutely have to play it, grab it on super-sale. It’s… really dated.

76561198050860552,1452749607,True,"This game... Holy shit. My friend kept talking about how awesome this game was and he even went to get me this and FEAR 2. FEAR is one of my favorite single player action horror games, with a strong focus on intense and challenging combat, atmospheric and unsettling horror elements, as well as the realization that what you're trying to eliminate isn't all that evil. Base game being 4 hours, the 2 expansions coming with the game add another 8 hours of gameplay, one starting right where the main game left off, and the second being its own story alongside the main journey of the Point Man. Get this game. Now."
76561198042799042,1452736645,True,This game is the a gem when it comes to level design and atmospheric horror. Story is decent and easy to follow. Whether it is surviving hoards of enemy soldiers or the mental devastation of a little girl this game delivers.
76561198043061381,1452594632,True,"Many people believe F.E.A.R. (subsequently just called FEAR) is a horror game, which is not quite right. The term which I find most appropriate to describe FEAR would be ""a military themed sci-fi/horror FPS"".

FEAR and its two expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, stand at the pinnacle of the FPS genre. Admittedly, FEAR lacks some variety in environment and enemy design. You'll spend most of your time shooting at enemy soldiers in offices and warehouses. But what FEAR is weak at is easily overshadowed by what it is good at, because everything else about this game is just [i]so[/i] good.

The game takes a serious and realistic approach with a tight atmosphere, and is consistent with it. At one time, it handles like a military shooter where you fight against enemy squads, and at other times you'll be stuck in nightmarishly visions or surrounded by supernatural beings, which is done so well that it never really feels out of place.

All the weapons sound and feel amazing. From the dual pistols, which are a lot stronger than they look, to the futuristic Particle Weapon and Repeating Cannon, there's not a single weapon that is boring or not fun to use. The shotgun is one of the best in history of computer games.

The enemies aren't that rich in variety, but make up for it with their behaviour. For a major part of the game, you'll battle the Replica Soldiers. Even now, 11 years after release, FEAR is heralded as the game with the best artifical intelligence thanks to these guys. They can crouch through tight spots, jump through windows and move furniture to use as cover, not as part of scripted events, but as their natural behaviour. Replay one particular fight, and it will never turn out the same way. These guys are just so much fun to fight. What's more is that you can really see and feel how your attacks affect them. Shooting a soldier will make him stumble and throw off his aim, while nearby explosions will throw enemies off their feet and may knock them down. Replica Soldiers' behaviour, actions and reactions make them incredibly satisfying to fight.

The level design doesn't offer many varied environments either. Yet it's incredibly well done with love to the detail. You will almost always have multiple ways to reach certain places. You can run along a corridor and take enemies head on, or crouch through the vent and ambush them from behind. Despite spending a lot of time in offices and warehouses, you'll still visit some amazing and incredibly atmospheric places, especially in the expansions. A futuristic cloning facility here, a creepy hospital there, these places are memorable and well crafted.

When you're not fighting enemy squads, you're usually in the horror part of the level. Sometimes you'll experience this through some kind of dreams or visions sent to you by Alma, who acts as the main antagonistic force in this game. Other times you have to fend off otherworldly beings that appear through portals. FEAR offers frequent jumpscares as well as drawn out segments with tight and creepy atmosphere.

Both expansions are outstanding. Extraction Point is essentially more of the same, while Perseus Mandate cuts back somewhat on the horror parts while giving you more heated firefights in return.

FEAR and its two expansions represent some of the best the FPS genre has to offer, and easily make it into the top 5 best singleplayer FPS ever made. It is a must-play for anyone interested in the genre."

76561198010465516,1452412382,True,"This is a pretty challenging shooter; I had to adjust the difficulty down from Moderate to Low towards the end. The ""reflex"" skill (like bullet-time) is interesting, but I didn't find that I needed it much - there is an abundance of health packs and ammo throughout the game. The story itself is quite enjoyable for a horror, but I didn't really like the way it ended (you can clearly tell they were planning a sequel). Overall, this is a game worth paying for and playing through. ****

NOTE: I had a SecuROM error (8016) when trying to launch both Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, this laptop I'm playing on has an Intel i7-6500 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950M GPU running Windows 10 Home and I've had this exact error when trying to launch an earlier retail version of Batman: Arkham City. You may also have issues if you have a ""Skylake"" CPU like mine."
76561198025256035,1452390723,True,"I played FEAR shortly after it came out, but never got very far, although I don't remember what put me off. Over a decade later though, I really enjoyed the game. It's a good mix of FPS and horror - the combat system is very fleshed out and easy to use, all the while keeping you on your toes with all the paranormal activty. 

The combat system works well and is in use most of the game, giving you ample opportunity to try out the solid selection of weapons, which I was happy to do instead of sticking to one or two main guns. The enemies are quite tough and can take a lot of hits (often an unrealistic amount), and on top of that, the AI is crazy good at trying to flush you out of cover, so be prepared for some intesne battles. Your superhuman reflexes (AKA slo-mo) is a major boon to get you out of these tight spots. Sometimes the horror aspects make for an even more intense situation, but for most of the game, horror and combat are separated. That's not to say you're always prepared, as a lot of things still sneak up on you. The game does a good job of keeping you on edge, but not going overboard trying to scare you at every turn, or worse needing a change of pants. 

Even for it's age, it has a great atmosphere - with everything at max, it still looks very good if you don't mind flat, low-res textures, but the effects like smoke, shadows, particles, etc. are great, except for light not traveling very far. The music and sound effects do a great job of rounding out the atmosphere, not too much, not too little (except for the darn empty soda cans that never stop clanging around when you walk into them). 

As for the story, it was very much on rails (like pretty much all FPS), but you're never quite sure exactly whats going on for most of the game. Uploading laptop data and listening to phone messages gives you little bits and pieces that don't mean much on their own, but let you start to put the pieces together to try and figure out what in the !%#@$ is going on. It's not the most in depth, or the most engaging story, but it was definitely able to hold all the aspects of the game together and keep me interested in figuring it all out. Fully exploring on easy (still not that easy, and I was getting used to my new Steam Controller), it took me about 14 hours to finish, which is kind of short in my book, but well worth a sale price.

Pros:
-Atmosphere (sound, story, and graphics all great and made it quite immersive)
-Combat/AI (if you don't mind tough enemies, otherwise maybe a con)
-Horror (not too much, not too little)

Cons:
-A bit short
-Those darn clanging cans

Overall, depite low replay value (unless you love the combat), I highly recommend grabbing this on sale if you're interested in a FPS/horror combo.

UPDATE: Extracion point: Good continuation of the story, picking up right where FEAR left off. There wasn't much depth to it, and it only took 6 hours, but it was well worth the play. Otherwise it's basically the same game, so my above comments apply here as well.

UPDATE: Persues Mandate: Again, my above comments hold true about gameplay, but the story felt pretty forced at this point. Playing as part of a second squad didn't seem to flow too well with the rest of the story, and there wasn't really anything new to learn about the story, which took about 7 hours. Still worth the play if you enjoyed the rest and bought the whole pack, which I'd recommend. If you're a fan of the combat, the bonus missions are perfect for that once you've beaten the story. With no plot or horror aspects, they're a slaughterfest where you can enjoy the combat and try to beat your previous times."

76561197983684753,1452270835,True,"F.E.A.R. is considered a first-person horror classic for good reason. Despite visually showing its age, the pacing, scares, and the fact your most potent nemesis is basically a little girl you're hopeless against make for quite the experience.

Somehow, the original F.E.A.R. manages to maintain a constant level of dread despite the continual reminders your character is a super-soldier with more than enough weaponry and ammunition at his beck and call over the course of the game. That's saying something. The cover mechanic is a bit clumsy to get used to at first, but once you get into a good rhythm and learn to read the environment, the frequent shootouts become much more enjoyable and feel incredibly rewarding when you overcome ridiculous odds. The story of the game, while mildly cliche, is told at a perfect pace and without distracting in times of tension. Even the first-person platforming bits, in the rare instances they crop up, aren't infuriating.

My only complaints involve a couple of rare encounters with bugs that forced reloads of earlier progress, and the same-ness of some environments proving a bit confusing when trying to find your way around or the correct route you need to backtrack. Beyond that, this game is pretty much an essential, and a kick-off to a (mostly) great series.

If nothing else, you can get a kick out of the dismemberment physics. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hoyhgx0HnC8"

Using its Advanced engine to thrill its audience, liturally Hold them in suspense, forcing players to peak around corners when unsure what was beyond. This game spans so far 2 sequals plus the expansions included with this game.  The Developers for F.E.A.R what they need to do, is Remake it using F.E.A.R as its center piece Using instead of a 2005 engine throw in the latest to date as software can go, because this game itself is a master piece.

Rinse and repeat that phrase during your play through of this game.

The jump scares are so constant, its weird.... because, in most games, I'm typically scared of the guys with guns, or at least try to avoid them. In this game, I feel a wave of releif wash over me when a guy with a gun appears, because I know that means I have at least 3-4 minutes of firefighting with enemy soilders and not 7-15 seconds with jump scares and scary little girls who wander around me.

The story itself reminds me of the Manga and Anime ""Akira"". Only, from the perspective of the soilders. 
But, that being said, the story wasn't that present in the game. I mean, it was in the background and it added to the game... but I didn't feel it was the driver of the game. Not that this detracted from the gameplay, having the story in the background that is.

The gameplay itself, the tight coridors, the long hallways, the open lobby rooms, all of this was terrific, fun gun play, good balanced enemies, enjoyable assortment of weapons to play with. Worth a pick up  for idk like 4 bucks?

76561198059081433,1451892929,True,"One of the better FPS i played. Campaign Lasts a while, you will find it entertaining, Something i can go back and replay a lot. One playthrough took almost 18 hours, not including the Expansions. 
Story Is good. I won't reveal too much info, but Story is good.
Has bullet time physics. Feel like i am neo, or Wesker.
Can make you piss your pants... towards the end, and on the expansions. 
F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin is much more extreme to that end.
Gun Sounds are quite realistic, At least in terms of the cocking sounds and pumping of shotguns.
Water physics Reflect your reflection. Incredible graphics for the time the game was released. 
Difficulty ranges from lol this is too easy, to getting destroyed every other 5 seconds, and in between. Normal is possible. Hard is like Lunatic mode on Touhou. Easy  you will usually survive.
Gore physics more extreme than W@W or any game of the time, comparable to Gears of War. Got the entire series/expansion for 12 bucks, Probably one of the better series so far I have played. Has a plasma cannon sniper that turns someone into a skeleton. Shotguns explode bodies. you can shoot someone iin the leg they will limp around or fall. still shooting at you. Game is extremely difficult on account of not being like modern games that tell you where to go, or having a few AI people like in cod or Battlefield. You are a lone warrior fighting endless hordes of Soldiers, Monsters and many other things. Learning to use Bullet time is essential. Melee is incredibly useful. The controller hasnt worked on any of them so far. I beat F.E.A.R. On either normal or hard, i cannot remember. Normal is relatively difficult, so its hard to say. Extraction Point is difficult. Game has Puzzle aspects, as well as a very well written back story and storyline as well. they could make a really decent horror movie out of this if they haven't already. Alma Wade Reminds me of Characters like Lucy from Elfen Lied, or Carrie, or Samara from the Ring. Relatively creepy game, Disregarding the jump scares, but more along the lines of what human experimentation did to someone and made them do. 

Best first person Shooter in originality at the time, something modern games seem to lack. I wish there were more games like this."

76561197997250429,1451843433,True,"Difficile de décrire autrement FEAR que par un mix entre The grudge et Max Payne. Dans ce jeu, l'action des gunfights est bien théatralisé tant au niveau du gunfeel des armes que des élément de mise en scéne: la déflagration des armes sur les décors qui projettent tellement de poussiéres qu'on est obligé de s'arrêter de tirer pour voir quelque chose et les éléments  qui volent en millers de morceaux à chaque coup de fusil à pompe. Ceci combiné rendent les gunfights fun et defoulantes. Bon, l'IA et le bullet-time y jouent pour beaucoup aussi. A chaque gunfight j'avais l'impression d'être Chow Yun Fat dans un film de John Woo.
Du coté horreur, on est plutot bien servi coté ambiance, le titre ayant la descence de ne pas abusé à outrance du jumpscare (je dis cela mais en fait il s'agit plutôt d'appartions au bout d'un couloir).
FEAR est sans aucun doute un des meilleurs FPS auquel j'ai joué de par son gameplay et son ambiance. Le seul défaut du jeu sont ses suites..."
76561198021129255,1451775206,True,"There are some performance problems I'm having recently, but none as bad as the first time I bought this game. I was able to beat the game and had a total blast doing so! This game has some of the best combat I've seen in any FPS game and it's a real shame that the multiplayer had to die. I think competitive F.E.A.R Combat games with some love from a potential modding community could be as fun as games like Halo 2 multiplayer!

Can't stress this enough though, try to buy this game from literally anywhere other than Steam. They're being retarded right now and only allowing people to get the first game and it's expansions with the combined purchase of F.E.A.R 2 and F.3.A.R which are widely considered to be very inferior games (even if F.E.A.R 2 isn't too bad in my opinion).

F.E.A.R on GOG costs about $10. If you want it, I'd get it there. But beware, I tried to buy it there, and my bank froze my card. Turns out GOG is located out of Poland, didn't know that since I don't frequently buy off GOG. But banks and credit card companies tend to see problems when one random transaction is being made internationally like that. Had to convince my bank that it was I who made the purchase, but still wound up asking them to cancel the transaction since before they contacted me about the issue, I had already bought the game for about $58 on steam. $58 even though I already owned F.E.A.R 2, which is bullshit, but whatever.

Even though I was totally ripped off, I still think the first F.E.A.R game and it's expansions were worth the $58, and I highly recommend that anybody interested in FPS games give this one a shot."

76561198041712167,1451515932,True,"Scaring people without physical contact is a daunting chore. Creating the ominous atmosphere necessary to cause people to apprehensively look behind them and instill in them a desperate desire to turn on a light is accomplished by FEAR in near absolute silence. FEAR is like a strange dream; the kind you wake up from in an altered, disturbed state of mind wishing the shadows on the wall didn’t resemble a person. While many horror games rely on disarming the player or having the boogieman hide behind every door, FEAR scares you in the same way deep water does: each trepidatious step into the dark abyss feels like another soft and silent thump on the door to your undoing.

The fact that horror wasn’t a tacked on aspect in FEAR really sold it. FEAR actually tries to be scary, and the spookiness is mature and mindbending rather than juvenile and cartoonish. FEAR blends the most effective aspects of Resident Evil, Max Payne, and Japanese horror, but it stills stands as something unique on its own.

FEAR is brilliant in its atmosphere and petrifying in its frightfactor. One of the best horror games of all time, and a modern classic to play in the dark."

I forced myself to play this after 2 hours to watch those spooky scenes during the game but I couldn't reach 5 hours. Graphics are dated, all assets are copy pasted during the whole copy pasted levels. You may like this game if you want but this is my opinion. AI can't see you when you stand above them on iron stares. AI on hard = adding granades to them to flush you out of your hiding place.There is no way in Hell this would be 2005 game of the year since a lot of great games released during the same year.

There is also a slow motion ""power"" you can use a bit like in Max Payne, which is very useful for the hard situations. 

Regarding the expansion packs, the first one, Extraction point, is a nice sequel to the regular game. The only thing is maybe it has less ""scary moments"" since there are few during the campaign, but a lot at the end.

The second expansion, Perseus Mandate, is really great. You follow another group during the events of the first campaign. There are nice features added, a good challenge with more nervous firefights, and nice scary content. I really loved this expansion.

76561198076111703,1449968822,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of the best games I have ever played. 

First Encounter Assault Recon has got to be one of the most iconic horror games ever made and creates its feel from atmosphere and an incredible story. This game mixes a fast-moving FPS with a grudging horror so perfectly that the two ganres seem like they were meant to be. The characters, the main Villan especially, are likeable and, in Paxton Fettel's case, downright perfect.

Now, yes, this game is old, but I am an avid believer that graphics don't matter. How good a game is should depend entirely on the gameplay and story, not how pretty it is. It's like finding your soul-mate. What they look like or wear isn't what you fall in love with. It's who they are and F.E.A.R. is just this kind of beautiful that doesn't come around anymore (speaking metaphorically.) It's the Marilyn Monroe of horror: Old, Iconic, and beloved. 

Is this the perfect game? No. Of course not. Even Marilyn Monroe had stretch marks and meat on her bones, but that didn't make her any less beautiful. F.E.A.R. is the same way. There ARE a number of glitches in the game, some that make it hard to continue, but those are so rare that you'd need to reload the game one-million times to actually get it to happen once. It also has some slow moments that get a little boring and some map areas that will have you walking in circles for hours, but that's just part of it's charm. The game is INSANELY scary, too. The little bug that this game creates under your skin will crawl through your flesh and eat your bones. It's not just scary, either. It's exciting with its wonderful gun-play and it's sad with its heartbreaking plot. You'll feel for the villan as much as you want to kill him. 

GET THIS GAME. PLAY THIS GAME. TAKE THIS GAME TO DINNER. LOVE THIS GAME LIKE A FRENCH BEAUTY QUEEN BECAUSE, DAMNIT, IT DESERVES IT!"
76561197983140368,1449887255,True,F.E.A.R. might stand for First Encounter Assault Recon. But this game really can instill that feeling too if you get into it.
76561198086855287,1449858780,True,This was surprisingly great..It feels like how modern shooters would be if they had followed the vein of doom and quake....It's a bit short so maybe wait for a sale but this is the most fun I've had with a shooter since modern warfare. And a really refreshing change of pace.
76561198133838893,1449784759,True,"Playing FEAR in 2015, this game feels like a funny mix of old and new. The level design and environmental puzzles come straight out of Half-Life, but the over-the-top shooting and meathead soldier enemies resemble Crysis or the new Wolfenstein games. Ten years on, FEAR seems like it's having an identity crisis. Of course, in 2005, it probably didn't seem so strange to mix these elements together, and thankfully, in this case, it works.

It's also supposedly a ""horror"" game, though it mostly fails on this front. The plot involves secret cloning experience and it features occasional jumpscares, but the actual gameplay is all 100% classic shooter. Ever the famous ""ladder moment"" didn't make much of an impression on me; I actually don't even remember encountering it in the game.

What really makes FEAR shine is the AI. Most of the battles are against enemy troopers, and the way they try to flank you and out-maneuver you is really second to none in shooter games. This is one game where the soldiers won't just run at you spraying wildly. Their hunting and survival instincts are advanced, but the player has a balancing weapon in the form of the bullet time mechanic. It's great that they decided to add that, as I think it's probably what prevents the game from getting needlessly frustrating like Far Cry 1."

76561198115158556,1449637204,True,"8.6/10 - Ten years later.. still amazing!

This is my first time playing FEAR. I was expecting a game that had aged like many do. I was wrong this game is amazing still. Reminds me of Half-Life2 except a focus on horror as opposed to action.

I don't believe in horror games.. They usually suck. This game is really scarey though. The lighting, bad guys and feel are all well done.

I'd specifically recomment Perseus Mandate. It's like whoever made it just said 'Who are we kidding, this game isn't scary. Let's just add a bunch of awesome guns and increase the badassdom'. And I think it worked. 

The only thing that really started to bother me was how often you take damage. I think this is just something that older games did, but I always hate when I have tons more health than everyone else, and they use that as an excuse to not give the enemies any reaction time. This game has pretty good stealth mechanics, but when they know you're there they will wallhack the hell out of you. I especially hated when they started shooting me before I could see them, nicking my shoulders or toes or whatever they could see. But for all those tiny moments of pain and anger, there's a sniper rifle that turns people into skeletons, so in the end it's all worth it."

The graphics (for the time) are great, the guns feel powerfull and devastating, and the AI is suprisingly brilliant, often attempting to flank you, flush you out of cover, or coordinate to chase you into the cross-fire.

And, as the title suggests, the game also has it's creepy moments. Not exactly scary, but they help build atmosphere, and they are a nice change of pace form the non-stop action.

Also worthy of note is how the guns in this game interact with the environment. Things get destroyed, large bullet-holes appear everywhere, and smoke/dust starts obscurring your vision when you shoot at certain surfaces, making the environment an active part of the gameplay!

If you like shooters and bullet-time: Go for it! If you're looking for true horror, I'd advise you to look somewhere else."

This is, hands down, one of the best shooters ever to cross a computer screen. Despite its age, its aged well. The story, implementation and mechanics of this game should stand as an shining example to modern day companies.

You play as an unspecified (so you can project yourself as the character) special forces operative, recruited by F.E.A.R. the First Encounter Assualt Reconnaissance. Your main mission is to hunt down an AWOL commander in charge of an entire battalion of mindless commandos. However as you get closer and closer the mission becomes less about one of Capture-or-kill, more Prevent-the-apocalypse.

The graphics are better than minecraft and the soundtrack really secures the ambience of the game. Despite its age there are virtually no problems with the game. The only one I did find was a sudden, seemingly random, drop in FPS which I later found to be a problem with my mouse. Not my mouse specifically; there is some problem with the game not properly supporting a Logitech wireless mouse. Using a Microsoft wired one I didn't experience the problem again."

76561197970790426,1448661897,True,"10 Year Retrospective Review- Does F.E.A.R. Still Hold Up?

Short answer: Yes.

When I first sat down to begin my pre-review playthrough, the first thing that stood out to me about Monolith's seminal FPS was just how astoundingly well it has aged. Much like Half-Life 2 before it, F.E.A.R.'s atmospherics, story, and most importantly gameplay are still respectible and even outstanding by today's standards.

Story:
You assume the role of an elite special forces operative known only as the ""Point Man."" Your mission- stop a rogue psychic commader leading a battalion of cloned supersoldiers. Along the way you'll encounter many different faces, enemies, and settings in your pursuit of your target. The closer you come to apprehending your mark, the more you realize that there are far more parties involved in this incident. A multi-million dollar corporation, a handful of researchers and scientist, and most importantly- a little girl in a red dress. F.E.A.R. is disturbing, convoluted, creative, and dark, and as the story twists and winds like a spider's web you will find yourself drawn in and immersed.

Gameplay:
Where F.E.A.R. truly excels in more than any other aspect is in it's perfectly executed combat. F.E.A.R. enjoys being caught between the old-fashioned shooters of yesteryear and the more modern flare seen nowadays. For example, you can only carry 3 weapons, but each weapon you'll find is fun to use and different. Or how you need to track down health packs although your health will self-regenerate up to a certain point (dependant on difficulty). Every bit of F.E.A.R.'s gameplay feels polished. The weapons are nice and vaired, combat is tight and responsive, melee combat is surprisingly viable and fun throughout. Crucial to all of this is F.E.A.R.'s revolutionary enemy AI. Replica soldiers are smart, reactive, deadly, and always find ways to surprise you. Just the other day during my 6th or so playthrough of this game I witnessed interesting new tactics deployed by the enemies that I hadn't seen before.

Presentation:
At 2005, F.E.A.R. was arguably the prettiest looking FPS since 2004's Half-Life 2. Showcasing many advanced lighting and particle effect techniques, F.E.A.R. was an absolutely gorgeous game in it's prime. 10 years removed, it has begun to showcase a few cracks in the paint. Character models are still good looking, and the particle effects still look excellent, but certain items, enemies, and locations are looking a bit dated. None of this is a dealbreaker, though, and where F.E.A.R. truly shines is in it's brilliant atmospherics. Every location you explore has it's own interesing themes, visual design, and flow. Shows dart about menacingly, sounds goad you into checking over your shoulder, apparitions follow you about, and all of it is perfectly scored to an oppressive, disturbing, brilliant soundtrack.

Package:
Unfortunately, the game's weakest aspect is most certainly in it's replayability. A lack of other gamemodes, multiplayer, or unlockables will surely mean you'll only play through this game for it's single player campaign. The campaign is long enough, and depending on your personal skill will take bewteen 9-18 hours. Fortunately for those who find one lone campaign to not be enough, this version comes with both of F.E.A.R.'s excellent expansion packs. Each comes with a compelling single-player storyline that builds on top of F.E.A.R.'s twisted mythos that will last you anywhere between 6-12 hours. Perseus Mandate in particular is worth replaying for adding several new enemy types, weapons, and a slew of bonus ""instant-action"" missions.
If this wasn't enough to win you over, keep in mind that even 10 year's later, I still enjoyed it every bit as much as the first time. That's gotta count for something.

Recommended.

Pros:
-Engaging story
-Precise, fun, refined gameplay
-Loads of weapons, each as fun to use as the next
-Atmospherics rivaled only by the best of survival horror games
-Responsive, challenging enemies who've yet to be matched by any other FPS
-Comes packaged in with both of Vivendi's expansions, easily doubling the playtime

Cons:
-Lack of replay value
-Neither of Vivendi's expansions are considered canon to F.E.A.R.'s official sequels (sadly)
-Some environments can look uninteresting compared to others

Do you know the true meaning of F.E.A.R.?"

The sounds and voices change depending on your angle like in real life!  Great physics like in real life!  The detail to the environment is great consiering its 2004.

Once prepared for it I walk out and play the game for another 10 mins and no jump scare and begin to relax. Then she appears out of f*cking nowhere and, once again, jump in my seat. 

Lessons learned: 
1) Don't relax when playing F.E.A.R
2) Shoot the bitch even if it doesnt deal any damage then run away.

Now shooting stuff when the game recognize that shooting stuff is fun makes it awesome, well this is exactly what FEAR does, Impact, Impact, Impact. In a nutshell the game is BadAss Close Quarters firefights in a dark environment, then pace it with horror, rinse repeat. Its not your typical cannon fodder AI, the AI know how to human, this include being not Aimbot and performing lots of moves making them interesting to fight each time. Of course play it on Max difficulty for PC FPS player, there is the slowmo, the quicksaves and too much medkits to help you out. In the other hand the enemy variety is lacking wich is mostly fixed in the expensions, but for the overall story experience and pacing, the main game is the way to go. The story telling is kinda meh too, cause of the way its tell mostly by phone messages. However the story itself is great, Akiraish story. Stranger things story is higly based on that.


''I know that people likes it cause its scary''

The scary part is more entertaining, but what I like with the horror is that its subtle horror more than just jumpscares. Atmosphere is another thing tho. The atmosphere in this game is awsum ; The game start when the sun is falling, then the rest is playing during that single night and what a night ! At the end, the sun appears again, there is no day time :D. Most of your time is spent inside, it feels like your alone in a shop after the closing hours + the character is you, you can see your full body -> Total Immersion. The paranormal horror is also respected, because you play in a dull realistic scenery with ''weird'' things happening. You dont fight the horror, you ''feel'' it.


''But the strongest point are the Gunfights''

Matrix meats john woo is how to describe the gunfights, its great as Fu***k. Its like a shooting simulation, but without the realistic booring part. No other FPS has surpass this pinnacle of joy in close quarters ; Particles that fill up the room, physic of stuff flying accross the way, loud gun noise and noises in general, slowmotion and ofc the AI. Real men play it for the guns at night with a beer. FEAR firefights are the shit, Slideckicking a guy by going down the stairs, then Shotguning a man and cuting him in half in slowmotion, bullets goes trough the air, penetrate the flesh, then hit a metal box behind making a shit load of sparks, the torso of the man is rotating in the air while is legs hit the ground with a loud noise, his gun continue firing and hit his buddy next to him in a fest of blood and gore... its... its love."

It's basically your character just fighting the exact same enemies over and over in different sections (industrial, office, etc) and the main storyline is meh at best.  Occasionally you will encounter phones with voicemails to listen to, but if you skip them you still miss nothing for the story.

The girl in the red dress says. 

You awake in cold sweat, alarm droning in
monotone as you see it's the interim time
between 31st October and the 1st of
November. Halloween night.

You stretch and boot up the computer as
you yawn. Close to two months without
your girlfriend, [i]Ms. Novocaine.[/i] But the
thought of your classmate, a beautiful
gothic girl by the name of Summer-Rain
lingers in your mind's eye.

Steam has now queued up a selection
of Halloween-themed games one can 
play, and a shooter from your past stares
at you, a game called

[b]F.E.A.R.[/b]

You stare at it, remembering through
a dream haze of when you played it
years ago, in the heyday of 2005,
when it was the horror equivalent of
the previous generation's [i]Crysis[/i].

Nostalgia and curiosity overtake your
sense of reasoning, and you make the
purhase of F.E.A.R. which includes its
two expansion packs, the first being
[b]Extraction Point[/b], which ramps up the
Horror factor 21 out of a scale of 10 
and [b]Perseus Mandate[/b], a parallel
adventure to the main story that stars
the equally-silent protagonist of the 
[i]F.E.A.R. Sergeant[/i] as compared to the
series' main [i]Point Man[/i].

To your shock, you [i]already[/i] own the
game(s), despite having no memory
or recollection of ever buying it. You
blink for a moment, before your the
hairs on the back of your neck stand
on end. You download the entirety
of F.E.A.R. and you expect it to
finish within an hour. F.E.A.R. is 
already downloaded, the logical 
explanation be damned.

Suddenly, your phone rings. At 2am on 
Halloween night? You answer.
Static greets you before a familiar voice,
sweet as honey, gives you a warning.

[i]""...she's watching you.""[/i]

Your eyes widen as the line goes dead.
F.E.A.R. stares back at you, when you
hear a soft giggle. Spinning round, you
see nothing, but the scent of Ms.
Novocaine's sweet musk has overtaken
you.

The light in your room goes out on its
own. You click [i]'Play.'[/i]

Immediately, you now remember why
F.E.A.R. takes the cake for one of the
most immersive shooters of not just
the early generation, but any
generation. Although badly rendered
and quite horrible-looking from a 
graphical standpoint today, the 
immersion, ambience and dynamic 
lighting of F.E.A.R. still holds up after 
all these years.

The audio is stellar. Guns sound like
they are discharged next to you and
you swear you smell the gunpowder
and scraping metal. The enemies of
the game, [b]Replica Soldiers[/b], have 
some of the most complex AI in any
game, adapting to your tactics and
trying to outflank and outgun you at
every turn. Tables are flipped
and doors barricaded as you
attempt to mow down their own
ranks with a mixture of gunplay
and melee strikes, with F.E.A.R.
being the only FPS you've seen
utilize scissor and roundhouse
[i]kicks[/i] in its game engine.

But F.E.A.R. sets the mood early
before the action with its pervasive
Horror element, with jumpscares and 
twitch imagery galore. The girl in the 
red dress, [b]Alma[/b], serves as some 
sort of overarching, supernatural 
presence throughout the game.

The story of F.E.A.R. is a strange
but refreshing mix of both western
action and military movies along
with eastern-influenced horror.
Some gaps in logic or pacing
aside, the game's story on its
own is solid B-movie fare, but
the infusion of its clearly asian
horror roots bring a welcome
new element to the regular
formula of grey and drab FPS
in corridors and sewers.

F.E.A.R. is constructed around 12
levels, but by Level 6, you feel tired
and spent by the sheer amount of
mental energy required to prepare you
for the scares and horror which have
become taxing. With the gunplay and
action having made you feel fulfilled,
you turn off the computer when you
hear muffled whispering from outside
your window.

You peer through the blinds and see
a bloodied girl in a red dress staring
back at you, Ms. Novocaine's eyes
leak blood as she opens her mouth
to speak. Everything goes black.

After a time, you feel the warm
touch of someone ruffling your
hair, the smell of strawberries 
together with a soft light which 
feels reassuring.

Your eyes open slightly and you
realize that it's dawn, [I]November
1st.[/I] You're in your room and 
the sun's rays shine in from the 
open window, while a girl in black 
petticoat and apple-green accents 
greets your view. She looks lovely, 
and even lovelier is how your head 
is in her lap. Your eyes widen in 
disbelief.

[i]""Hey. You're awake...""[/i] Summer-Rain
says, sliding her hand down your 
face and holding your cheek. 
Your eyes half-close in bliss as 
the scent of strawberries 
overtake you. 

[i]""W-what happened...?""[/i] You ask,
and Summer-Rain tells you that
when you didn't turn up for the
morning class, she huffed to your
house, broke in through the open
window and found you on the floor,
out cold, door ajar and sweating 
profusely.

[i]""Didn't know you cared.""[/i] You start,
as she pouts and looks away, 
blushing fiercely while
snapping at you. [i]""I couldn't
leave you like that, even if I wanted
to. I thought you might've died.""[/i]

You smile and thank Summer-Rain,
before apologizing to her for making
her skip the morning class with her
being here. You offer to buy her
breakfast but her hand stops you
from leaving her lap, while her other
hand still holds your head steady.

[i]""Summer...?""[/i] you begin, realizing
that she's looking down at you with
a pensive, serious expression.
Her voice is hushed now, sweet as
honey. [i]""Tell me something.""[/i] She
begins, and you are instantly 
enraptured, enamoured with her 
even more.

[i]""...anything. What is it?""[/i]

Summer-Rain glances at the doorway 
of your room to see the bloodied 
Ms. Novocaine vanish out of sight, 
before looking back to you and 
smiling her signature smile,
reassuring you like no one ever has.

Pros
-Fantastic Shooting
-Varied Weapons
-Fun to use weapons
-Interesting Campaign
-Great soundtrack that fits the game well
-Some creepy sequences sprinkled here and there...
-The best A.I i have ever seen in a videogame.

Cons:
-Locations are repetitive
-There isn´t much enemy variety
-Some lag issues with newer operating systems


But yeah...if you want a great and fast solid 5-8 hour campaign filled with awesome shooting and particles effects get thsi game....oh and did i mention it also comes with 2 more expansion packs that offer 5-8 hours of gametime each one. Yeahhh. get this game Now!!!"

As usual, it’s hard to decide whether to recommend or not when I know others will not be as bothered by certain things as I am, but it is my review after all so here are my issues with FEAR:

1.	It did not age well. The sky looks terribly flat and the level design consists mostly of gray corridors. 
2.	The game clearly has 2 gimmicks which it wants you to see as soon as possible: the slow-motion effect and flashy gun particle effects.  That is its thing, its selling point and it’s not enough to make a whole game. The game becomes boring after a while.
3.	The girl from The Ring. The story of FEAR is actually not that bad but the antagonist is clearly the little girl from The Ring horror film and, again, it feels too on the nose.
4.	The gameplay is the ultimate example of a classic PC first-person shooter where you have a health bar that goes down as enemies hit you, and the enemies WILL hit you the very moment they see you from a mile away, which feels unnatural. In a shooter like this, the game becomes about the health bar management and I hate that gamy feel. 

The good stuff: well, some of the jump scares are quite creative and overall the graphics are not the worst I guess. 
The AI, despite the annoying super-accuracy and reflexes, is quite smart. Enemies will throw grenades at your last known position and jump over obstacles (smarter than some of the modern AI in games).

IN CONCLUSION, I bet it was cool in its day but I am getting incredibly tired of this game. And to prove that this is not just about this being an old game, I am also playing Doom 3 that was released a year earlier and it is a way more interesting game despite having many similar problems.

Update: I uninstalled the game and feel sooo much better now. I was forcing myself to give another try because it is a well-known game, but holy moly, am I happy I don't have to play that grey goo anymore."

76561198013844762,1445885983,True,"I've come to the conclusion that F.E.A.R is almost my favorite shooter. It's almost the perfect shooter really if it wasn't for interval 11 and the tedium of shooting the waves of paranormal crossing over during your escape. Despite the shortcomings which are few, this is the best gameplay in a first person shooter I've played.  It all just feels so great and really does make you feel like ""a god among men"" as Harlan Wade put it to Pointman. All of the guns feel powerful the way they impact the enemies and the enviroment which coupled with the amazing sound design of them leads to firefights that leave you feeling like a complete bad ass looking over the carnage you just inflicted. The game gets a lot of praise for its ai and rightfully so as the enemies reactions are always impressive as long as you give them time to react before killing them. I especially like how they might be taking cover from you and one shouts out that he's in cover then another replicant will tell him to shut the fuck up. Also really like how F.E.A.R. has an explanation for why there are so many bad guys to kill. I know it's just a video game but it always bugs me anyway when a game prided on its narrative just throws random bad guys at you (Uncharted). It's especially cool in this game considering the replicant forces context. Speaking of the narrative I think F.E.A.R. has a very interesting one and all it's just a little weird that your team was formed to combat the paranormal and supernatural and yet every time Fettel's signal disapears nobody knows whats up or the Armacham problem is written off at first as a ""gas leak"" not expected paranormal activity but when you find delta force teams flayed corpses nobody bats an eye. Still the story is properly spooky and keeps the ball rolling. Again shortcomings aside this is one of my favorite shooters. Probably my favorite shooter of the last generation and some might argue the best. I cant recommend it enough."

76561197980044260,1445290191,True,"Don't be fooled by the title or some trailers: F.E.A.R. is a pure FPS game. Besides its smooth and enjoyable gameplay, a lot of (well-made) scripting add some elements directly inspired from classical horror movies (you know, the little girl with superpowers) and a few physical mindfucks (those you could also find in Antichamber). The story is not exceptional, but the ambiance easily palliates that.

The two extensions are follow-ups to the main story, and add some time to the already quite long game experience. At this price, I can only recommend it if you like FPSs and are not against some jumpscares from time to time."

While there is a slight deviation between enemies in various areas of the maps, I find that the game starts to get boring around the 5th or 6th stage. I marathoned this game though, so it might be better to just space out your play time.

The visual effects are very impressive, particularly the clouds of dust, explosions and bullet effects in ""slowmo"" time. Even more striking is the games effective use of sound. The use of surround sound means you can hear footsteps approaching from behind corners, and the overheard shouts of your foes gives you crucial information about how many are left or what tactics they're about to use against you
However as has been previously said there are occasions where you seem to be moving through endless corridors with no-one to fight, This i think was supposed to instil an eerie atmosphere as light bulbs pop and different bit of the environment will move making you think there is someone the and does so very well, however they do try to carry this on to long leaving the player yearning for the next battle.

76561198134455049,1444331545,True,"F.E.A.R. is your standard action plot, based on cliches specific to the genre, while being marvelously adorned with apparently dominating paranormal elements, which grab your attention. By making use of its clever acronym, it promises a tension-fest and often doesn't fail to deliver. While the plot is sometimes left in the background, supernatural events become repetitive and the focus is entirely on its highly realistic shooting gameplay, it remains a decent title even after all these years.

Pros:
+highly accurate and realistic combat
+clever interference of the paranormal in the otherwise quite standardized plot
+most of the environment is destructible. You've got smoke from grenades, holes in the walls, lights that go off when the bulbs are destroyed, blood stains everywhere someone gets shot.
+there is that uncertainity about the border between reality and imagination which makes up a good psychological horror game

Cons:
-repetitive level design; in 90% of the time, you won't be able to distinguish one area from another
-repetitive combat, new enemies are introduced at great distances in the game and they rarely offer a change of pace
-story is pretty disappointing most of the time

Neutral:
+/- a lot of focus on the gameplay and often very little story to go with it. If you're a die-hard fan of shooters, this is clearly something for you. Otherwise, it might ruin your experience.

Overall, it's certainly a game worth trying, especially if you're a fan of shooters. It deserves a 7.5-8/10 in my opinion, mainly due to its unforgivable repetitiveness."

The original F.E.A.R. is a great horror/shooter game with AI that is constantly trying to outsmart and flank you. It's fantastic. But I cannot recommend this game at this price point. F.E.A.R. 2 was ok, and F.E.A.R. 3 was just...no bueno. Forcing people to pay this insane price for an older game and bundling it together like you're getting a deal...you're not.

+ Destructive surroundings makes every encounter aftermath feel like the lobby scene in the matrix.

What I didn't like
- Horror sequences were not scary, almost always scripted. Who cares about ghosts when you're a death-machine with a fully-loaded shotgun? Annoying breaks from the otherwise fun combat.
- Story was eh. But this isn't really a game you play for the story in the first place.

Yes! I absolutely recommend this masterpiece of a game! You might have to download: dinput8.dll to help with the FPS drop. Leave it in your main folder and the game should run like a dream.

[b]New Players:[/b]
F.E.A.R. is a tactical FPS game with strong psychological-horror elements that has you play as the Point Man, who is the latest member of the specially formed F.E.A.R. ([i]First Encounter Assault Recon[/i]) team. A psychic commander named Paxton Fettle is on the loose and commands an army of clone super-soldiers. Your job is simple... eliminate Paxton Fettle!

[b]Review:[/b]
My whole gaming life I have been of the opinion that no matter how old a game is, if it's good, then you can always come back to play it. F.E.A.R. really represents that notion well as I've played and replayed this game so many times, I've lost count ([i]hours on Steam don't count[/i]) and to this day, this game remains one of the best games I've ever had the luxury of playing.

[b]Game play:[/b]
It's about as straight-forward as FPS games get. It's mostly about shooting the bad guy, but this game adds a bit of flavour to it. If you play on extreme difficulty ([i]which I highly recommend[/i], run and gun will definitely and regularly get you killed. It's not the most difficult game, but the AI is pretty intuitive. Squads communicate with one another, issue orders such as throwing grenades, they take cover and even wait for you to move out of your position with pin-point accuracy. Your best bet is to take it slow, take cover and take enemies down one at a time... unless you land a really good grenade throw.

This was also one of the first FPS games to add slow-mo, which gives you a massive edge during your fights and you feel like a total bad-ass. The bar regenerates overtime and can be upgraded with boosts you find at each level. This also includes health boosters which is definitely worth looking for and not too hard to find.

Every single weapon in my opinion feels absolutely awesome to handle. The pistol has got awesome kickback and kills off the lower commandos with ease. Once you find the gauss rifle or submachine gun, you'll probably always carry at least one of those due to their plenty ammo, but few things cause devastation to almost everything ([i]including armored soldiers and bots[/i]) as the shotgun. As expected, it does suck long-range, but medium is manageable while close is just death for those in front of the barrel. There are some other unique weapons too such as the penetrator that shoots stakes and then some railgun weapon called the particle-beam cannon with an assortment of others. You can only carry three at a time, but you can switch as you please.

[b]Graphics:[/b]
For a 2005 game I was incredibly impressed at how well it holds up to this day. Of course you can see that it has aged, but it still looks and feels crisp. The water effects were one of my favourite, not to mention the bullet holes in the wall or the walls ripping apart as you fire at them. It was these kinds of little details that made F.E.A.R. such as a unique and awesome game for its time.

Since it's a Monolith game, it makes use of the Ghoul engine, so blood, gore and gibbets is a common experience. The game is also quite dark. Personally, I never adjusted the brightness as it adds to the aesthetics, coupled with a pretty good flashlight, but you'll still get a scare even with better lighting.

[b]Story:[/b]
As mentioned before, you play as Point Man, with your mission being to take down Paxton Fettle, the psychic commander controlling the clone commandos. As you progress, things quickly turn for the worst, with regularly psychological hauntings taken place and a young girl appearing throughout as if she's stalking you.

While making progress, you'll come across laptops that reveal some background lore, explaining who the main characters are, how this mess started, why the clone-soldiers were created, how Fettle is linked to them and finally, who the girl is and why she keeps on appearing.

Although the game is old, I don't want to say too much. Experience the game for yourself!

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
I think I've driven my point quite well on how i feel about this game. In the future, I'll most probably come back and play it again, it's just that good. There's also two expansions, Extraction Point which continues after the end of the original and the stand-alone Perseus Mandate where you play as a different character, but adds more details to the lore. 

Just get this game and give it a shot!"

Buy this game."
76561198043786140,1443567792,True,"This game looks great for a game from 2005. None of the elements are exactly original, but the way the game blends them together is a new twist on most of them. If you are into jump scares, more tactical FPS, psychic elements, and an interesting story, then this would be a good game for you. The game has some interesting weapons as well, and I think the water texture looks great considering it was 2005. Better graphics than Halo, which seems to be the standard these days. But that being said, this game is no Halo... Lol."

76561198091335620,1443312912,True,"Extremely good game with lots of jump scares and with enough action to keep you on edge. It is a bad port from console though but makes up for that with better graphics. 

Its buggy. The game something locks up on certain actions like jump or even using the in game menu which keeps you stuck in the game until you have to do a hard reset.

Can not be played with Raptr, it will sometimes lock up completely for no reason, I will send them a report but I doubt they will give a shit for a 2002 game.

I hope they patch the faults cause it is still to this day a really great game. I bought it on sale so I wasn't too pissed off."
76561198033287437,1443308861,True,"F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon. I don't know why people use these kind of acronyms for they're just dumb. The game itself, however, is excellent.

It is a first-rate shooter with AI that actually has at least a semblance of a brain. Guys will try to flank you, jump through windows and over railings as well as try to get out of your line of fire. Glass shatters sensibly, grenades blow guys into chunks and the special slo-mo time ability is great to use.

It is also spooky with a story that will keep you interested. Once you find out what's going on, though, the story turns from spooky to tragic, and I think that the writers failed to take that shift into account. As a consequence, the ending is both conflicting and unsatisfying.

Nevertheless, getting to the end is great fun and well worth the trip.

F.E.A.R. is one of those games that manages to scare me, while at the same time tries to be a shooter and succeeds.

Pros:
-pretty scary.
-fun on firefights.
-guns feel satisfying (i luv my vk12 shotgun).
-using bullet time is also fun.
-pretty good story
-AI is (suprisingly) smart.

Cons:
-currently,multiplayer is dead
-finnicky physics (that can do hilarious glitches,which takes you out of the atmosphere)

Score:
To be honest,this is a pretty fun (and scary) game. in my opinion,it deserves an 7.5/10 for me."
76561198094570898,1443281832,True,"F.E.A.R
F.E.A.R can be compared to the Doom series in terms of gameplay. The weapons and bullettime are a very cool aspects of the game. The story isn't to great but the gameplay makes up for that. The levels are pretty big and have a cool design the graphics are still pretty good. Unfortunatly the ragdolls thent to spasm out sometimes and the walking sound can be anoying as hell if there is no other sound. Oh and I recommand playing this game on extreme or high at least because the bullettime makes the game really easy. The lightning can be a little buggy sometimes.The game also has a detection system so you can be a little sneaky. I highly recommand buying the game with the DLC because I found the DLC even more entertaining then the main story the DLC.

7/10

Extraction Point
The DLC was very cool and continues from the end of the main story. So I recommand playing this first before you play Perseus Mandate. The only thing I found kinda disapointing that you couldn't change the resolution to 1920 x 1080 without a workaround. To change the resolution go to C:\Users\Public\Documents\TimeGate Studios\FEARXP\settings.cfg

7.5/10

Perseus Mandate
Perseus Mandate is an awesome add on and a must have to all people who played and liked F.E.A.R. The storyline is much better and there are some cool new enemies and weapons added. There also is a lot more action. 

8/10"
76561198076770092,1443240715,True,"F.E.A.R is an elegant mix of action and horror. It's vicious, bloody combat is interspersed with moments of gut-wrenching tension. The excellent balance struck between these two elements, and the way they interact with F.E.A.R's surprisingly enjoyable narrative is perhaps the game's strongest aspect. While F.E.A.R's gun-play is a bit dated, it still manages to be a treat regardless. weapons feel great and there is a real sense of power and importance behind every shot. This effect is further enhanced by a bullet-time ability which not only provides the player with another fun tool to play with, but also serves to show off F.E.A.R's beautiful particle effects and gore. 

With such good combat, it is a shame that F.E.A.R suffers from poor enemy variety. While there are a handful of special enemy types, you will primarily be fighting similar sets of human enemies throughout the game's duration. In addition, levels have a severe lack of visual variety. I spent much of the game creeping through similar looking offices and ruined buildings. Despite this, I rarely got lost, as the game does and excellent job of guiding you through it's levels while still giving you the freedom to explore, often rewarding you with weapons and upgrades for doing so. FEAR's atmosphere and lighting are also note-worthy, serving to ensure you are always on edge, even during the game's calmer moments.

Interspersed throughout F.E.A.R's combat are moments of intense horror. the game does a great job of directing your attention to just the right spots through the use of clever sound and light cues. while the risk of danger in these scenes are minimal, they do serve to break up what could have been an otherwise tedious string of combat segments. They are paced to perfection, never feeling drawn out or overdone. These scenes also provide a means of engaging narrative delivery, which often left me excited to see what would come next.

F.E.A.R's story is engaging and serves to tie the experience together. It's psychological themes fit together nicely with the game's dark atmosphere. Much of the story is presented through audio logs and radio messages, which allows it to develop without slowing down game-play. unfortunately, the game's voice acting, while not terrible, tended to stick out in the midst of F.E.A.R's more serious tone. 

Despite it's flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed F.E.A.R. it's many parts all fit together well, forming a game that I recommend to anyone interested in shooters or horror games and is able to look past many of the game's aging elements."

76561197993184342,1443138615,True,"Years ago I gave this game a bad review due to some performance issues, even though I loved everything else about it. Thankfully someone commented on it, telling me to install a patch into the game files and it runs amazing now! This is the link they told me to use: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=759431266

I can't believe that this 16 year old game still plays, looks, and sounds so incredibly well. If you've never played it before then the dated textures/models won't impress you, but the gunplay and slo motion ability/effects are some of the best I've experienced. If you have played this before when it came out, but don't have it on steam, then absolutely buy it and install that patch. It's a fantastic blast from the past that holds up to this day. 

If there was a proper remake/remaster of this game I'd be all over it."

Should be owned."
76561197970509330,1443072915,True,"One of the best first person shooters ever. Great atmosphere, a nice long story and lots of blood. The slo-mo feature makes it that much more fun. The original is by far the best and for me i love the expansions to the first F.E.A.R as well. The story gets more confusing as you move past the original, but the concept is pretty awesome. Still a top-notch shooter long after it was first released. A few things of note: The ai is fantastic in this game and the weapons feel realistic. Take your time when you play this one and make sure the lights are out. Not for the scares but since it all takes place at night it makes it that much more immersive. It's not a scary game, but there is a definite creepyness to it. If you haven't picked it up yet, do yourself a favor and get it. 10/10 rating from me."
76561198053628125,1443041165,True,Good classic game.
76561198057977066,1443041157,True,"(WARNING: When you play F.E.A.R. and it´s expansions, be sure to play it at night, with your lights closed, specially with nobody else home, for a full effect of piss and s*** in your pants.)

If I were to describe the first F.E.A.R. and it´s expansions, I would describe it as The Expendables meet Max Payne, which then meets The Grudge. (ok, my description might not just had up, buy at least I tryed :S)

Seriously: WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? BUY THIS GAME!!! Yes, it is old, but I played it many times and it still feels awsome to me! There is a reason why GameSpy considered it to be 2005 Game of The Year. I had this game some years ago, then I gave it to a friend: now, I bought it again on Steam at amoment when it was inpromotion, and I tryed it again, along with the expansions that it brought. After this many years, this game still blows my mind. It is a game like SuperMaio or CastlevaniaIV: you will play it again and again if you want to, and you still love it, because it is damn good.

This game (I am refering to the original game, F.E.A.R.) was revolutionary at the time because the develepors decided to mix the FPS genre with the Horror genre of gaming. To be fair, the game it´s good mainly because of the fire-fight, and not because of the horror. The combat system was made perfectly, with the slow-mo ability and how the enviornment around you reacts with bullets and explosions.

The expansions are better than the original in some aspects: Extraction Point has much more scarier and bigger horror sequences, while Perseus Mandate is more dedicated to the action and is more challenging, with you having to face a new type of enemy which is more powerfull and agressive. The bad thing about them is that the story of those expansions are kinda silly, even thougth they are still better stories than the cannonical games (F.E.A.R. 2 and F.E.A.R. 3), which have more silly stories and who are games that are not scary at all.

1. The AI in the entire F.E.A.R series is by far smarter than your typical AI. They try and think of ways to out smart you and communicate with one another.... leading to actions such as flanking you. 

2. The environment was very well designed, lighting fits the atmosphere perfectly, and the use of gore throughout the world will never let you down.

Overall, I enjoyed this game, but it really only has a couple of truly scary moments. The Perseus Mandate had the most and actually made me jump more than once. The rest of the game is really just creepy and/or gory. The best parts are the fighting. The plot and the ""horror"" parts were just meh. 

Two main gripes. One, really this game could be renamed ""HVAC Crawling Simulator"" as you spend a LOT of the game crawling through ventilation ducts. And two, all of the crazy defenses that these buildings put in for security can always be circumvented by walking around them through connected offices or crawling through ducts. 

If I could give this game a ""star"" rating. It'd be 3 out of five. Slightly better than average. Buy it if you don't have anything else to play."

I have only played single-player, so I can't say if the multi-play is worth any.

I'm not really an FPS person (I suck), and even on easy this is difficult for me. But I played through the first 3 hours without dying. 
The mood in the game is ""spooky"" more than ""horror"", quite a few jump-scares, and there is lots of violence and gore. 

Takes a while to get used to the controls- I constantly pressed Z instead of X ... And G instead of F (and that is really funny if you know what these buttons do!)

You all can still enjoy the multiplayer mode contrary to what steam tells you, the masterserver powered by gamespy got shutdown a while ago, but the game lives on thanks to efforts of community members, although basically dead it's still awesome for the ones like me that refuse to accept the games faith and need the casual flashback to post 2007 :) but there's still 2-4 servers that refuse to die and will probably be around in 10 years..

The mood Nathan Grigg brings with the soundtrack is a stellar, immersive experience. I think, if it weren't for playing F.E.A.R. a year and a half ago, I would never have even contemplated in getting back into gaming.

You can shoot baddies in the legs and they will limp away and completely shoot baddies into red mist at close range with the shotgun! What im trying to get at, is its not EASY but its FUN! 

To be fair, the spooky bits of the game are kinda predictable because after roaming around lonely hallways the music will change and you can kinda suspect it but it does get you off guard.

This is a an extremely creepy game that stays fairly creepy throughout. True, this game is full of jump-scares but they are all well done. The jump-scares are not usually the loud, annoying kind but the kind which give you quiet glimpses into a seemingly other world (or rather, mind). If you take the time to look at everything carefully and listen to every answering machine message you can find the game's mysterious plot gets explained quite thoroughly as well. The controls are good, the sound is adequate and the lighting and graphics, while fairly simple and minimalistic by today's standards, are clean. The enemy types do not have a great deal of variety (though there is some and this game features the most potentially realistic looking power-armor design I have ever seen in any game).

This game is short and the plot is highly linear (which limits its replayability severely) but the story that is told is fascinating and thought-provoking while the gameplay is tense and creepy throughout. The enemy AI is frighteningly clever (far superior to Half Life 2's soldier AI) with soldiers who will flank, ambush, flush you out with grenades and often refuse to get tricked into being piled up in bottle-necked doorways. 80% of this game takes place in-doors (mostly in after-hours night time office spaces (which I think is a cool idea and is a setting I haven't seen since the early part of Half Life 1) so as a result the enemy AI (and the graphics and lighting) doesn't have to deal with as much complexity as it might have otherwise. 

Much of this game reminded me of the first Die Hard movie in terms of action (due to the night-time, largely abandoned office building environment) but in all the best ways. In many ways this game's style is like an even cross between the action and environment of Die Hard I and the creeping horror of The Ring (if you can imagine it). This made for a great combination. The ending is a bit of a cliff hanger but is suitably shocking and horrific (in the extreme) while still paying homage to The Ring (which is where the game has clearly borrowed most of its horror style). The music is strange but well suited to the game but I found only 3 songs I really liked (the main opening theme and two action themes they were)."

If you had a really good time with the gunplay and bicycle-kicking people, you should play F.E.A.R  2: Project Origin.

I bought this game after seeing a tiny bit of gameplay from some video on Youtube. I went into this game only knowing it was a shooter, and had horrific themes, and two DLC's which are more like stand-alone games. I got my money's worth. 

[h1]Combat aspect[/h1]
The game is a shooter that relies more on being smart about your shooting, using slo-mo, grenades, and skill, rather than blindly shooting like a madman. At times it is difficult, as enemies do a lot of damage, plus armor only does so much, and is hard to find, the carryable medkit system, various weapons, and the Health/Reflex boosters are nice. The enemy AI is somewhat smart, but I have seen a few times when they were idiots.

[h1]Horror Aspect[/h1]
Now, I don't play a lot of horror games, mainly because most are just jumpscares and mindless wandering. This game does horror perfectly. It will switch between parts of combat with enemies, and parts of horror. When it gets scary, it is the atmosphereic creepiness, a bit of mental horror, and just overall dread, not relying too much on jumpscares. At times, when the creepy stuff happened, I have begged for combat.

[h1]Final Overview[/h1]
Overall, this is a great game, it has a good plot, things that you can search for, and fun gameplay. You can run it on a decent computer too. I would reccomend this game to anyone, if they can handle it...

A modern horror-thriller first person shooter with greatly detailed graphics for their time, artificial intelligence and sound engine (AI voice out how many you've killed in a nonscripted manner) and a in-depth plot about the Psychic Little Girl called Alma Wade, who is an subject of horrifying experimentation from her father, Harlan Wade. Alma gains the ability to manifest horrifying nightmares twisted from her interpretations of the experiments that took her life but not her spirit. She can liquifey flesh and phase through existence and is the mother of two men...who are both killers and are psychically linked. A Personified F.E.A.R.

A special tasks force known as First Encounter Assualt Recon are sent in to investigate the disturbances from a recent case of attacks committed by Paxton Fettel, whose a prisoner released from his past of many tortorous experiments the same as Alma and the ""Synchronisity Event"" that ties him to the Project known as Origin. You are called Point Man...it is time to investigate the disturbance and find the truth about the Project known as Origin and Stop Paxton Fettel before it's too late!

Didn't really care about the story until the end but out of all 3 of the FEAR's this is definitely the best one.

Update: Finished the Expansions and all I have to say is that Extraction Point is really great, offers up some more of the satisfying combat from the main game, using the MC from FEAR again, with well placed spooks as well. Perseus Mandate on the other hand is just bland, with a cast of characters that don't matter and with Alma and Fettel just kinda thrown in there because PLOT. The combat doesn't feel nearly as fun due to certain enemies just feeling like complete bullet sponges, and with spooks that aren't nearly as well paced or as well done in general as either the base game or EP. In my opinion Perseus Mandate is completely worth skipping while Extraction Point is definitely worth playing through at least once after the main game of course."

-------------

F.E.A.R is a game that hasn't aged well over the years since I played my old retail copy.

Featuring some of the most boring environments in gaming history and notoriously bad pacing, the first half of the game is a slog. Even worse, the scares completely fall flat and the game is a cakewalk on anything other than the highest difficulty, which still feels too easy at points.

Despite all its baggage, when F.E.A.R finally hits its stride, it's excellent.


F.E.A.R Extraction Point:
------------------------------------

This is the best F.E.A.R has ever, and will ever be. 

If you're looking for classic F.E.A.R gameplay with good pacing and fantastic encounter design, this expansion is better than the original. It's light on story, but it certainly has less ""walking down a hallway"" moments than the base game.


F.E.A.R Perseus Mandate:

76561197988609440,1438424231,True,"This is one of those games that really set a bar. A bar that no one has bothered to try and reach let alone climb.

Alot of people praise the A.I. in FEAR and for good reason, it was unique in it's purpose and methods. it would actually use tactics that are adjusted according to how YOU act in gunfights and how YOU fight. Unfortunately it doesn't shine too well when you charge in and kick it in it's bitch face.

The game is fun enough if you dont mind spending 90% of it in an office building, still if you've ever had a fantasy of shooting up the workplace this isn't a bad way of nurturing that feel.

Play the game on hard or above to get the most out of it. otherwise the A.I. will act REALLY retarded."
76561197982285714,1438278176,True,"One of the best games of all time. The time this game came out was the game with best graphics and it was something really new. It was awarded as game of the year. Absolutely loved the game. And the deathmatch at the time was the best deathmatch game could possibly have. Too bad it has no deathmatch now. Was sickest thing ever!

I wish they remake it or make really solid F.E.A.R. game soon."
76561198028390148,1438271740,True,"Fear was the system hog of its time. It was also touted as one of the best FPS titles of its time. Does it hold up to both those titles today.

Well, yes and no. Yes it's one of the best FPS titles of its time (and still an impressive shooter nowadays), no it's no longer a system hog. Let's look deeper into that.

FEAR puts you in control of Point Man, the newest member of a government team meant to combat paranormal threats. You're sent out to stop a crazed cannibalistic solider who's taken telepathic command of an army of clone soldiers. Meanwhile, there's this creepy girl stalking you through the whole thing and making people explode into meat splatters with her telepathic abilities. The whole game is pretty much you tracking down the cannibal freak, killing clone soldiers, investigating the situation's backstory, and discovering all the dirty little secrets. It's a mildly intriguing story, but i'll admit it's never really hooked me. The gameplay on the other hand...

Woo boy. This game has some of the best shooting i've ever come across, even by today's standards. If you've ever watched a John Woo film, you know what you're gonna get here. the gunfights here are cinematic, frenetic, fast-paced encounters where bullets tear chunks out of concrete, glass windows are shattered, bodies fly around like ragdolls, blood splatters, smoke emanates from gun barrels, dust clouds your vision, and furniture is obliterated. Despite the near complete lack of enemy variety (they're all literally clones), the action never gets old. All this is made even better by the smart enemy AI. Clones pin you down, shout orders to their squad mates, flank you while the others keep you in cover with gunfire, throw grenades your way, jump over ledges to avoid your bullets, run away from your grenades, take defensive positions, crawl under tables for cover, notice your flashlight, and even hear your footsteps if you don't crouch. The AI here was ahead of its time and still impresses today. 

The game's also pretty scary and atmospheric too. I wouldn't call it terrifyin, but I will say it managed to give me the chills and jolt me many, many times. Disturbing hallucinations, that creepy ghost girl stalking you, chilling music, and things moving on their own all work together to unsettle you whenever you're not locked in a fierce firefight with enemies.

Like I said though, the graphics have already been eclipsed tons of times in the years following this game's release. It simply isn't all that demanding anymore. On a mid-range laptop, you can easily run it at max settings with 60 frames per seconds. The visuals themselves are very sharp at max settings, but not exactly impressive. Textures are... all right. Water effects are fairly basic. The two places the graphics are still fairly impressive are in the lighting effects and, especially, the particles. Remember what I said about how the environments just come apart when you're in gunfights? Yeah, the particle effects actually add to the gameplay here and turning them down deals a serious blow to the enjoyment in my opinion.

Overall: recommended. It's a solid, exciting shooter worth your time and money. Not for the graphics enthusiasts (though the game isn't what you'd call ugly), but definitely for shooter fans and anyone who wants to see some terrific AI at work. 

Pros: 
Frenetic, intense, satisying combat
Impressively smart AI
Great music and sound effects
Genuinely chilling
Not hard to run nowadays

Cons:
Visuals aren't all that impressive anymore

This game no frightens you, it gives you feeling of being misplaced. Like ""what am I doing here?"", ""why again I'm all alone and should attack dozens of heavily-armored intelligent soldiers?"". Or even ""Why my mother is such a bitch?""
So, remembering all that uncomfortable stuff along with the point it is a railroaded FPS with stupid and logically inconsistent story... and it's not only railroaded, but keeps you in dark and narrow corridors of industrial premises... Usually it's pretty obvious for me at that point that the game is sucks.

Not this one, though. Yeah, about it's story - the less you know, the better. Don't bother looking some evidences, or reading any briefing info - it's only make you more uncomprehending.

It's all about visuals and behavior of your enemies. About whom ""story"" tells you as of mindless puppets, controlling remotely by the main villain. Wrong point. Not only those soldiers acting together, like covering each other with fire and outmaneuvering you, skirting from different angles. They are, in fact, assess the situation and act correspondingly. They even show some emotions! Like answering ""no way!"" when they are few, and their commander urges them ""Forward!"".

And for visuals part... I'm not into all that technological stuff about particles, shadows and so on. Usually. It is irrelevant for me basically. But there, in those narrow corridors of industrial premises - when I'm shoot and when I'm shooting at - I see clouds of dust and crumbs when bullets hit the walls, and it feels so realistic that I don't remember any of so praised FPS later, which gives you so natural experience from the middle of shootout.

You know, I've started this game to write a turning down review. I'm strongly not liking the game plot, its cutscenes, voices from the answering machines - all connected with the story. But the game mechanics in F.E.A.R. makes me retreat in awe. It is a masterpiece, which stands proudly above the endless railroaded FPS games like the Call of Duty series.
Yeah, multiplayer part of the F.E.A.R. is no more, so the only reason to buy the game now - is to feel how much plainer and stupid modern shooters are.

Until she died at 8 years old after her captors ( and father?) pulled the plug. Now she wants revenge? That is what I made of it anyway. There were a few glitches I encountered along the way. Falling off the world was one, and loss of all weapons is another. Cheats are useful, for when these events happen. I myself used two.  Godmode, which proved semi-useful, and kfa (restores all ammo and health). For the many times a glitch caused me to start over. Apparently, from my research, this game is the best in the series.

1 part The Matrix
1 part The Ring
1 part Akira

The end result is merely a sum of its parts, no greater and no less. F.E.A.R. is a case study in a game that ought to have been legendary, but settled for merely great. The narrative is straightforward but captivating, the pacing padded with overly long segments of repetitive corridor segments. The gunplay is satisfying, the slow motion mechanic a joy to use, the visceral ragdoll deaths of the enemies unique to this day. F.E.A.R. excels when it's shocking you with Alma's apparations, depositing snippets of story in the form of phone messages, hacked laptops, and terse communications, and in the throes of combat, where clever enemy AI has them flanking, ambushing, and surprising you with startling cleverness.

Yet, the gameplay never goes far enough. It introduces a variety of enemies, from your standard grunts, to heavily armored and armed soldiers, to mechs, floating droids, turrets, wall-crawling ninjas, and others. The disparate enemy types are never thoroughly mixed together, a clear missed opportunity, the groups often operating as solo encounters. There are no 'boss fights' as many would expect of an FPS, either. The game's length works against it here, highlighting the repetitive nature of the fights.

The long runtime of about ten hours hurts elsewhere, too. The writing is inconsistent. F.E.A.R. relies on a less-is-more approach, giving the player just enough to make inferences and guesses, but not so little as to be lost. Actual dialogue is surprisingly realistic. It's not written like an action movie, full of macho one-liners and forced urgency. Your mission coordinator, Rowdy Betters, is jaded and no-nonsense, treating the assignment like a job, and is by far the strongest voice acting performance. However, the game's story isn't complex enough to fill 10 hours. About halfway through you'll simply roll your eyes at Alma and Paxton Fettel's cryptic apparitions, as the plot is easy to guess and the shocking nature of their appearances runs stale.

The story nosedives with the introduction of Norton Mapes. Little more than a parody character, he's part Cartman from South Park, part Dennis Nedry from Jurassic Park, and horribly out of place. I'm unsure if he was cooked up to break tension or simply give the player someone to laugh at, but his appearance is such a heavy detriment to the game's story that, if rated on a 10/10 scale, I'd drop F.E.A.R. a point, or even two, due to his jarring presence. It cannot be emphasized enough what a horrible addition to the game Norton Mapes is.

The gravity of the story is further stymied by the lackluster ending segment. Alma's power is never truly felt firsthand once she is freed, and the reality-warping might of her psychic power is let down by the obstacle she most often employs: the strange psychic zombie-ghosts that float towards you, which die in one hit, and you fight in such number that they lose all impact. Her nightmare segments fail to impress. By the ending, you've guessed the story and its twist, and have experienced so many nightmare segments that hers aren't very impressive. Then, the facility explodes, you survive, and the game ends with a classic horror movie twist. It's an unsatisfying conclusion, too heavy on trope and too soft on revelation.

F.E.A.R. remains a unique gaming experience that gets many things right, but many things wrong. It's still worth a play even to this day, but don't expect to be blown away by it. It's incredible that this game came out in 2005, hardly showing its age. It's a shame this game didn't go all the way. The potential inherent in the formula is off the charts, but it's lacking that final oomph to really set it over the top."

First of all, the game was released in 2010 I guess, and it doesn't even really look or feel that bad at all; physics works well, graphics still holds up even today, slow-motion might be a bit used trick in games but in F.E.A.R. you really enjoy (or at least I did) when you shoot at enemies with your dual pistols and you see sparks flying everywhere, blood splattering from enemies to the wall behind them and then their bodies collapsing to the ground after filling them first with bullets. I also noticed myself being on my toes all the time because the atmosphere really is agonizing. Can't wait to get to play the sequels!"

76561198014766672,1436478663,True,"F.E.A.R is a first person horror shooter that was released in late 2005 and is the first game in the F.E.A.R series. The game's story is set around a supernatural phenomenon, which a special forces team is brought in to deal with. You play the role of the team's pointman, you have super human reflexes yourself as well!

The gameplay in F.E.A.R while has no new and creative elements to the shooting genre, it is easily one of the most satisfying shooters I have played. All of the guns feel as if they are perfectly balanced, there is a good mixture of guns too; from the non-fictional type in pistols and sub-machine guns, right the way to the fictional weapons, such as laser beams. The way the game feels as you play it just ticks all the boxes.  The super human reflexes act as like a 'bullet-time', giving you the chance to setup a couple of head shots while also running back to cover; it is very useful at times in tricky situations.  There are also times when you actually can use melee to take down your enemies, normally melee in fps games causes you more problems than it's worth, but in F.E.A.R if done correctly, melee will instantly kill enemies. 

Even though this game was released little over ten years ago; you would never be able to tell from the graphics on show. You are able to play the game in full resolution, at a perfectly smooth 60 frames per second (most of the time...). It looks amazing; the lighting is again key in horror games and it is done very well here. 

Even though F.E.A.R is supposed to be a horror game; I unfortunately have to say that I was not scared at all when playing, and I am normally a bigger wimp than a little girl. There are very little if any at all jump scares; all the scenes which you expect to be scary are predictable so you loose the shock value from them.

We have a number of different difficulty levels that you can play on here; so you can choose how hard you want to play the game; I have played through twice now, the first on easy mode, and I didn't die once so I wouldn't recommend that if you are looking for a true experience/challenge. 

All of the 12 levels in F.E.A.R are perfectly designed, all of them can end up being a maze if you don't concentrate on where you are going, and some of the latter levels actually have some tricky puzzles to work out. There are tons and tons of rooms to explore for ammo, medipacks, increased health pool and bullet-time packs, and new weapons. As well as the laptops which you can hack, and phone voice mail messages to listen to, so you can flesh out the plot even more. 

A full playthrough of F.E.A.R on a regular difficulty took me roughly thirteen hours to complete; I also spent a lot of time finding all of the power-ups, finding the extra story bits as well. After you play it through once though, other than playing again on a higher difficulty; there is no real need to playthrough again. The story is linear and will always end up being the same. 

I had a couple of technical issues while playing; the smallest would be the auto save feature. When you get to a check point in the level, the game will auto-save, this can sometimes take 3 or 4 seconds, while this doesn't sound like much, it really impedes on the gameplay - you get no warning that it's coming and it really knocks you out of the immersion. 
Secondly, is an issue which had my puzzled for a while; every so often my frame rate would tank to single figures, obviously I knew this wasn't right - so I was checking nothing could be causing any problems in the background and there was nothing running. After a little digging around online I found this article on the Steam forums that fixed the drops in frame rates - I would recommend anyone wanting to play the game implement this fix before they start. (I don't have a Logitek keyboard, and it still fixed the issue).

F.E.A.R is in my opinion, one of the best shooters out there and one that everyone needs to experience. I can safely say I enjoyed it from start to finish and will be looking forward to playing the extra  (DLC?) packs as well as the rest of the series.

As a whole the game is relatively easy and linear but this is a good thing in my mind , this is a shooter not a puzzle-game .
Linearity , yes it is pretty linear , you have max two ways to reach a point , the second one is put to find max Hp increase and reflexes increase  and to make it worse because there are only 2 ways you can pretty much destroy the opponents  so no surprise attacks from them and I am talking on extreme here :( .

You can have only 3 weapons type at  a time , which sucks :( .

In extreme diff the game has to offer 15h + 6h + 6h = 27h of gameplay which is good .

The game is not scary at all for me and I like that the supernatural element is kept to a minimum , killing monsters is harder for me than humans with a gun  .

The graphics are good for the year of release , but the physics those are very good for it's time ... many good games don't have this level of damage even in 2015 ."

Pros: 


+ Scary as hell 


+ Tons of unexpected Jump scares


+ Interesting story 


+ Mysterious atmosphere 


+ Good FPS Mechanics for a 2004 game 


+ Slow Motion


+ 14-16 Hours of Gameplay 


+ Twisted story 


+ Good level design 


+ Unique style 


+ Spent the entire game waiting for Alma to appear on a ladder. Braced myself every time I climbed a ladder. Squeeled louder than a school girl at a One Direction concert when it happened.  LOL :) 


+ By the way it also comes with two expansion packs that are 5 hours long each 

( Extra 10 hours of gameplay)


+ 9.99$ for 20-25 hours of gameplay narrative xD



 






Cons :


- Outdated graphics ( since it's a 2004 game duh..... ) 



- Sometimes it gets repetitive 



- No GUCCI :( 






Verdict : F.E.A.R is an outstanding game for being unique and special among other solid first person shooter games . In addition, this game is soo scary to where you can use your flashlight AND your gun, and the game will STILL scare the shit out of you.

76561198042574257,1435665043,True,"Still a masterpiece, and still one of the best AI in a FPS."
76561197960393604,1435516369,False,"This game is frequently hailed as one of the only truly scary FPS games made.  A game rich in atmosphere, and setting, that drives you to keep playing it.

But I just don't see it.  I have tried to get into this game.  I want to like it.  But I just can't.  I can't now, and I couldn't ten years ago when it first came out, the first time I tried to play it.  Nothing in the game, nothing in the story, makes me want to keep playing.

That is not to say the game doesn't have its strong points.  The AI in this game is top notch, and holds up well even today.  The enemies will try to flank you, surround you, they react to being seen, being shot at.  They'll throw grenades, they'll fire from cover.  They really are some of the best AI I have ever seen.  And the game should be played if just for this alone.  (Edit: This only applies to the first enemy type you see, the soldiers.  When you start getting to the invisible robot ninjas (I am not kidding), the good AI goes right out the window.  I witnessed two of them performing a Scooby-Doo routine of running back and forth randomly between the rooms in a hallway, simply because I had my gun pointing down the hallway so they wouldn't come at me.  It was hilariously pathetic.)

But there are also problems.  There's no on-screen indication when you take a hit.  Your life goes down, and that's it.  So you could be in a fire fight, shooting from cover, and thinking you're doing well, only to find yourself on the edge of death.  Because you didn't know that the enemy was hitting more shots than not.  Or didn't realize that someone had gotten to your side, and was free to open up on you.  That severely hurts this game.  (Edit: There actually IS a visual indicator.  But it is on the very edge of the screen, and flashes by so quickly that I literally did not notice it for more than three hours of gameplay.)

They also made a bizarre choice with the weapon and ammo mechanic.  In an effort to make you switch weapons often (you can only carry three at a time), when picking up a new weapon it comes with a full magazine loaded, and enough ammo for a second.  However, if you already have a weapon of that type, when you pick the new one up for more ammo, you get roughly a third of a magazine.  Of course, you can game this system by first tossing your weapon on the ground, picking up the new one (which is now reloaded for you), and then picking up your old one with all the ammo you had before.  You'll start to do this very rapidly once you find a weapon you like.

Also, despite being only ten years old, the game does not run well on modern systems.  Disabling ""HID-Compliant Device"", and in my case ""HID-Compliant Vendor-Defined Device"" is required to make the game run at anything higher than 6-7 FPS.  So don't expect your gaming keyboards and mouse to function when you play this game, and be prepared to reenable those when you have finished.

There are other problems.  The game forces ""Letterboxing"" when it does cinematics.  Even if you're using a wide-screen monitor and resolution.  So expect to see black bars and the top and bottom of an already wide-screen image.  And the FMV cut-scenes are letterboxes as well, but set in 4:3 ratio, so they'll be displayed with a box with black bars on all sides.

So what about the story?  Well, this was before the ""scary little girl"" trope was completely overplayed.  But even so, nothing in this seems to work.  There's a few pseudo jump-scares, and some places where the graphics will change on you into another, ""spooky"" scene.  But both Max Payne and even Postal 2 of all things had done this years before.  (Quick edit: The Postal 2 expansion that featured this was released the same year as F.E.A.R., but five months before.)  And to a better effect.  In fact, that might be one of the problems I had with this game ten years ago.  It so desperately wants to play like Max Payne, but with a horror twist (""Bullet Time"" - the slow motion effect - was featured in Max Payne as well).  But this game just didn't seem to push hard enough.

There's a level of interactivity... but it's so painfully limited that you notice more when you CAN'T do something than when you can.  You can only do anything with phones if they're already flashing with a voice mail message.  You walk by a radio and can't turn it on yourself, but some will spout something directly from the Exposition News Network, letting you know a plot update... and then promptly fall silent again.  There are blocked doors, sometimes you can figure out a way to open them, but frequently they can't be.  And, again, to put in perspective as to the environment when this game came out, System Shock 2 and Deus Ex had both been out for half a decade before this game was released.

The game shows its age now.  But it wasn't fresh and exciting when it came out.  F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon (which, BTW, Assault and Recon are kinda mutually exclusive, but they had to fit that name in somehow) was a game that was trying to just exist.  They may have had a grander goal in mind for it, but they didn't put the effort in to see it through.

The game also used Gamespy for its Multi-player, which means the Multi-player aspect of the game no longer functions at all.

So, no, I can't recommend this game.  I find nothing in it that makes me want to keep playing it, so I don't feel comfortable suggesting anyone else try it either.

Update:  I am still trying to play through the game, and oh god, it is getting worse and worse as I play.  I think I submitted this review way too early.  And I will probably have to keep updating this as I play.  This game is bad.  Downright incompetent in many aspects.  There are updates above to what I mean.  But here's another:  The interactivity, the phones with messages?  Absolutely no thought was put into where to place these phones.  Now, remember, you are hearing voice mails sent to specific people.  Early in the game, the phones are actually in offices.  But when you get to the office level, these phones are hanging off the walls in common areas.  And the first piece of actual information you get from a phone is one hanging in a wall in an area with three desks.  THIS is who you call with the important information, not a CEO, not security, but three desk jockeys sharing one phone.  The game designers, and level designers, did not put any effort into this game at all.

Update 2: I have finished the game.  The last couple levels were better than the rest of the game in that they had a hint of creativity to them.  But only a hint.  And you had to wade through hours of filler to get there.  This is the video game equivalent of an Asylum movie.  Another game I forgot to mention above, in the ""games that were out first and did it better"", Doom 3 beat this game by a year, and did the spooky corridor shooter - with bits of information parsed out through personal messages - better.  This game is just a slow, painful drudge of a boring, poorly paced, generic shooter.  Avoid it."

F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point is the first expansion which continues the story after the suspenseful cliffhanger the original game left off on. In this expansion you get tougher, and more intense firefights along with more paranormal activities.

F.E.A.R.: Perseus Mandate is the second expansion, however, rather than continue the story, you play as a different member of a secondary F.E.A.R. squad, investigating a project known as Perseus Mandate during the same time-frame of the original F.E.A.R. Like Extraction Point, Perseus Mandate ups the ante from the original, but with less to be spooked by, and feeling a bit sub-par to its fellow counterparts.

Enemies tend to use cover and I like how they communicate with each other and act on the orders they are given via radio, but there are only like 5 different types of enemies and the maps don’t change much either. In the end you are just wishing for it to end, because you’ve visited that same place (or at least a very similar one) just in the last mission. As you can expect, the graphics are old and what is supposed to be its greatest feature, its story, is really not that much interesting until the last bit.  By that time, however, you have probably guessed the ending and the only exciting thing about it is making sure you were right the whole time. 

Oh, and seriously, they could have come up with something better than: “We’ll regroup later, you go alone first” in every single mission. Gets tiring pretty soon. Other than that, the slow motion mechanic is quite cool, but don’t expect the game to scare you too much. I don’t know. In most cases I probably wouldn’t recommend playing it, but since it’s not too long and it was quite a game back in its day, I suppose it couldn’t hurt to give the game a try.

It is not without it's imperfections when looked at from a modern perspective but much effort was made to make the game focus as much on the horror aspect of the story as it dod on the action and neither disappoint. A true survival-horror game often slowly fills you with dread and giving the odd jump-scare to race your pulse, something CAPCOM has since forgotten for their Resident Evil games in favor of aggravating quicktime nonsense and over-the-top silly action, but I digress.. FEAR has no such failings although the action doesn't disappoint, the bullet-time game mechanic which is familiar to those who've played Max Payne games makes the gameplay so much more fun and for a near-decade old game I was mesmerized by combat AI that was far more advanced than I'm used to seeing and wasn't surprised to find out it was revolutionary for it's time.

The best way to describe it is a Japanese horror movie in the middle of the Raid. The shooting part is spot on with great feeling weapons and no lack of enojyment. One of my favorite parts is that the guns don't tend to suck as you progress. Normally a starting area pistol or smg will be obsolete later in the game, but FEAR allows you to keep using them and they stay relatively effective! There is even melee combat in the style of ONI. The SloMo effect is fantastic and fun! It seems overpowered at first but with the right difficulty setting it fits in perfectly. Easily one of my favorite shooters and horror games.

It doens't have much replay value though seeing as all the jump-scares and enemies are scripted, but that's not what this is about. the combat is superb and the slo-mo trigger adds a great depth to the game. you will find yourself using this 'power' often. Sometimes this makes the combat a little too easy and that can make things repetitive. 

For me this is the best F.E.A.R. game from the whole trillogy. Not because it's the first F.E.A.R., but because it's all about the ballance between horror and FPS. You never feel that you know what's going to happen or where you're gonna end up and that's a key point in any horror game. The second ad third F.E.A.R. are good. But they are more about the combat then scaring the shit out of you.

So here's a summary:

Pros:

- Great pacing
- good switches between horror and combat
- great atmosphere
- jump scares!
- limited guns keep the game fluent
- slo-mo gives combat depth

cons:

- outdated graphics (for some a con)
- no replay value
- slo-mo can make combat too easy and repetitive

This is a great game with some interesting (not gamebreaking) features and i would recommend picking it up if you have some spare change or if you are looking for a good horror game to add to your collection!

76561198026485814,1434500524,True,"FEAR is a bit dated, but it's still a great somewhat-spooky tactical FPS.  You'll find satisfying weapons, slow-mo karate kicking, clever AI, and inexplicable difficulty with climbing out of water."
76561198006215362,1434400592,True,"What do you get when you take a first person shooter, give it great guns, atmosphere, level design, a suspenseful plot, and spooky psychological scares? You get FEAR.

FEAR (First Encounter Assault Recon) is a typical first person shooter at a glance. You move from point A to point B, gun down some baddies, flick a switch here, blow up that, turn a crank there, pick up ammo, etc. What makes it unique is the horror implemented into it. Between sessions of mowing down replica soldiers, you are treated to creepy dark places in buildings, officers, sewers, and even a research facility. Images of Alma and Fettel haunt you as well as what appear to be flashbacks along the way. Corridors fill with blood, specters appear out of no where, and voices or strange signals come in from unknown origins. Throwing you away from the run and gun style and then putting you into tense progression then throwing you back into the gunfights makes for an awesome receipe that likes to really play on your emotions.

Aside from the awesome weapons, the game has really nice story flow. You chase after Paxton Fettel, but along the way, you get side-tracked and have to complete other objectives such as rescuing hostages, investigating areas, linking up with team members (hopefully) and getting the hell out of nasty situations. Along the way, you'll fight mind controlled soldiers, specters, drones, stealth soldiers, and even a few mechs and heavy suits. When you're in the horror parts of levels, you'll get incoming transmissions from unknow origins and may see or hear things that can make you jump if you haven't played through or forgot they were there. It tends to play more on the A aspect of horror as opposed to the B, but there is some B there.

Combat and gameplay is simple for a shooter with two really awesome perks. You have boosted reflexes (which, in addition to your health, you can increase the meter of finding boosters) that slows the world around you allowing you to gun down soliders easier. You also have a jump kick and slide attack, very uncommon for many FPS which usually use melee as hitting someone with your gun in common practice. Second, the AI learns your play style presenting a really fantastic challenge. I tested it by starting off as a run and gun, get in there, shoot me all you want I'm coming for you style to where I saw the AI hiding or retreating to different cover often. Other times, I played it safe, hid behind crates and walls, leaned, shot, duck and cover. Eventually, the enemies were flanking me, doing pincer attacks, and coming at me hard to fish me out. Every time I changed tactics, the AI did the same for next time. It gets me wondering that if the intentional breaks in the action to move to the more horror parts of the levels was for that purpose, to recalibrate the AI. Regardless, the transition from spooky to run and gun and vice versa is sheer genius.

There are two major issues I have with this game, however. One is that it's short. I can get through this game in 6 hours, less if I put more time into it. This game came out around a time where these games were becoming faster, easier, and designed shorter sadly which many FPS post Half-Life 2 tend to be now. I can understand that Multiplayer in an FPS is more popular now then Singleplayer, but outside of a game's story, I love to play Single first to get a feel for the game's mechanics and style and practice with the weapons first before I go in and totally embarass myself until I get used to it. The second issue with this game is not really a huge one, but it's still there. I really wish that the AI would support you and join you, even if for brief moments. You do sometimes link up with squadmates or joint op teams (Delta mainly), but either something happens to them, you get derailed from your path, or you watch them do scripted routines and they tell you to go do something or find someone. At least it's not like in Doom 3 where you're praying you link up with Bravo, but the reality is you know you never will and you're alone. The linear path I could complain about, but this isn't the type of game meant for exploration and the atmosphere at least immerses you into the game so that can easily be overlooked.

Overall it's a great game that has the same formula you'd expect an FPS to have with its own nice little contributions. It's no Half-Life, but it's unique, exciting, and scary enough to keep me returning when I'm in the mood.

In an article by PC Gamer US, Fear XP is awarded the ""Best Expansion Pack"" in 2006.  I would like to add that while FEAR does not have the graphical fidelity of newer titles the gameplay is unmatched when comparing this year (2019) titles, imo.  For what it is worth i did not play any FEAR titles untill 2015 and i would like to note that i view these games without nostagia vision or rose tinted spectacles. If you can get past the issues with modern operating systems and hardware. Not to mention logitech hardware does not get on well with F.E.A.R. and will cause stuttering and other performance related issues, i urge you to give this series a go. Also it sounds pretty good in terms of firefights. 10 out of 10, go play it."

The AI will flank you if they can, they'll use basic unit tactics to kill you if theres an opening. The game is fantastic and you definitely will enjoy it, however its not an insanely fast paced shooter so if you prefer those this game wont be for you.

The scares are moderate, they are very effective, and amazingly well done, but they aren't really all that scary but they do their job and make you feel a bit more tense about whats around the next corner. The static effect on the hud whenever a scare is about to happen really makes you feel on edge.

HIGHLY recommended for anyone that enjoys a good story, a great shooter and an amazing horror experience."

76561198061694662,1433959388,True,"Great game. The first one I played that had bullet-time. Pretty intense, with a long single player story. It´s not just another FPS, it has a message, like a movie."
76561198022862133,1433868513,True,"A little dated (especially the graphics), but still good fun the first time you play it. Unfortunately it relies a lot on jump scares, which means that if you come back to it a second time it won't be nearly as scary. However, it does manage to create some tense and uneasy atmospheres. The combat is ok, fairly fast-paced, but some sections tend to drag on a bit. The enemy AI really isn't that incredible, but there is a good variety of weapons, and the slow-mo system is fun to use.

As for the DLCs, they're alright, Extraction Point is definitely the 'scarier' one, whereas Perseus Mandate is more action-oriented. They introduce some new weapons and enemy types to keep things fresh.

Overall it's a fun little game, quite short but it's not that expensive anymore, so you'll get your money's worth. The only final gripe I can think of is that the screen resolutions can be a bit stretched if you play on widescreen, but it won't inhibit your gameplay."
76561198001660080,1433801640,True,"Compared to games of today, the scare tactics this game use are very outdated and I really can't recommend this as an horror game, unless you just started playing horror games. But as an action game with horror themes is honestly, still excellent. The gunplay is great, the AI and the effects makes the combat very visceral. This great quality varies from game to expansion pack to great to excellent.

The MP doesn't work anymore, but if you are searching for Quality Single Player FPS where combat is central, and just KING, get this game. Highly recommended if you just completed Bethesda's Wolfensteins and want more.

76561198152476763,1433055614,True,"[b]REVIEW: [i]F.E.A.R: FIRST ENCOUNTER ASSAULT RECON[/i][/b]

Although [i]Resident Evil 4[/i] broke new ground in merging horror with action, it was by no means the only offering in 2005 that mixed horror with action. [i]F.E.A.R[/i], a first person shooter, was by no means the first game to mix horror with action, but it was released to considerable hype and acclaim. When I play games like this, it is for the atmosphere and story, but would I get it?

Armacham Corporation, the creators of a small army of psychically controlled soldiers. The intended commander, the unhinged Paxton Fettel, has gone rogue. The First Encounter Assault Recon team, a special forces group that deals with the paranormal, is sent in to kill Fettel and end his control over the soldiers. But as the new Point Man of F.E.A.R delves deeper and deeper into the mystery, they’ll soon uncover the sins of the past that Armacham are trying to cover up. Sins that link Fettel, the Point Man, and a mysterious girl called Alma Wade…

I like games with a good story, and the one in [i]F.E.A.R[/i] is enjoyable. It’s not quite as involving or as in-depth as, say, [i]Alan Wake[/i], and a lot of the background and story elements are easily missed, being in overt but optional phone messages and laptops you can find out more from. A few of the characters, particular Mapes and Alice, are somewhat irritating and, in the case of the latter, hard to get much sympathy for that is badly needed. But it’s still good for what it is, and genuinely unsettling.

The graphics probably were top of the line back when this was released, and while there are some minor problems here and there, it’s quite good. The character models for many of the NPCs don’t look as good as many latest ones, but the graphics overall contribute well to the atmosphere, and it’s clear that this is where much of the massive 17 Gigabyte download went.

Sound-wise, well, it’s fine enough. The normal music isn’t particularly noteworthy, doing the job that it does. So too does the voice acting, though that is somewhat better. However, the eerie sound effects, and the stings that they have, do help add to the atmosphere of the game immensely.

Perhaps my biggest complaint is about the gameplay. It’s a very short game, which I finished in 7 hours, and a lot of the FPS action is repetitive and tedious. The restriction to 3 weapons, particularly in situations where you need more than one heavy weapon, is a pain in the posterior, and there’s a distinct lack of variety in enemies. The slo-mo mechanic does help with the gameplay, but it also feels like it is barely beyond a gimmick. A few of the weapons are fun, if you have a sadistic streak. There’s a stake-firing gun that allows you to pin enemies to walls like butterflies in a collection, and there’s a death-ray that makes me feel like a Dalek. But ultimately, I was left wanting more, and not from the expansion packs.

Overall, [i]F.E.A.R[/i] was enjoyable enough. I may one day peruse the immediate sequel (rather than the expansion packs), but for now, I’m done with this game.

The two expansions each improve upon the original with more open and taught situations whilst advancing the creepy storyline. Whilst it already represents excellent value at its full Steam price you can periodically pick up the entire franchise from Bundlestars.com for a price that is close to theft.

Although FEAR lost its historical battle with Half-Life for the mantle of King of FPS following the appearance of the Source engine for me this was always the better game. Regardless of whether or not you agree, anyone with even the slightest interest in shooters who hasn't played this by now should really make a priority of getting hold of it.

76561198006560453,1432127558,True,"[h1]TL:DR? See Conclusion[/h1]

[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]
F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon, is a first-person shooter (FPS) survival game developed by Monolith Productions (known for such games as Shadow of Mordor and the Condemned series) and published by Vivendi back in 2005. During its time, it was one of the most graphically and system intensive game overshadowed only by the release of Crysis (1) two years later. F.E.A.R. features a unique game play mechanic which makes use of what it calls the 'Reflex' ability or more popularly known to players as 'slow-mo'.  It also features advanced enemy AI, and a story that blends Japanese style horror with intense FPS action in a single gaming experience.

[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]
The F.E.A.R. Team was sent in to investigate and eliminate Paxton Fettel, a psychic military commander who, using an army of clone soldiers known as the Replica Army, started an uprising against Armacham Technology Corporation (Umbrella Group of Companies). The player takes on the role of 'Point Man' (whose real name was never revealed), a new member of the 'First Encounter Assault Recon' (F.E.A.R.) Team.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ Graphics that aged well
+ Great Atmosphere [i](Lighting, Sound Effects, Particle Effects, Soundtracks and overall presentation)[/i]
+ Game Mechanic [i](Reflex skill and varying melee attacks)[/i]
+ Good overall voice acting
+ Fairly expansive levels which maintain their linearity while at the same time allowing for exploration for...(See next PRO)
+ Collectibles that enhances the player [i](Increase in health or reflex)[/i]
+ Great gun play
+ Advanced AI that knows how to employ basic tactics [i](Flanking, suppressing fire, grenade flushes, covering fire etc.)[/i]
+ Great story with good lore, backstory and world building
+ Good game time [i](around 7-9 hours depending on playstyle)[/i]

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- Physics (Physx), lights, and particle effects can sometimes be glitched
- Multiplayer is no longer available
- Combat may feel repetitive
- Too much ammo, health and armor lying around. [i]It is in my opinion that horror games should encourage caution which would add to the scare element of the game[/i]
- No weapon mode switching: [i]Most weapons are burst fire for some reason[/i]

[h1]NEUTRAL:[/h1]
+/- The game features a 'one shot kill' mechanic if the enemy was unaware of your presence.  [i]Personally I feel that this made the game easier than it should have been, but then again, other people might like the idea.[/i]
+/- Intro cinematic is completely glitched with low resolution quality if the game resolution is set to, or higher than 1080p. [i](not game breaking since the only 'pre-rendered' cinematic is on the intro sequence.)[/i]

[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]
[b]GREAT GAME[/b] and comes [b]HIGHLY RECOMMENDED[/b]. F.E.A.R. is a game that offers a great first-person experience that blends both horror and action in one perfect match. Overall, despite its age, F.E.A.R. is as fun as it was 10 years ago (2005).

[h1]WORTH IT?:[/h1]
I can easily [b]RECOMMEND[/b] this game even at [b]full price[/b] since its only $9.99 or your regional equivalent with the added bonus of the [i]non-canon alternate universe[/i] expansion packs 'Extraction Point' and 'Perseus Mandate' which are also good games in their own right.

Spawning a line of sequels, should be enough incentive to show F.E.A.R is a quality game. The Story is fast paced, making F.E.A.R an exciting, fun game I enjoyed playing through a second time. I recommend playing on the hardest settings, for maximum challenge. Definitely pick it up if you don't have it in your library. Bundle Stars usually carries it, packaged with the sequels for a total F.E.A.R experience."
76561198041178432,1431801036,True,"One of my favorite shooters on PC. Occasionally scary, fantastic shooter with a brilliant slo-mo mechanic and really clever AI.
I recommend playing it on the hardest difficulty if you are even relatively skilled at shooters as it doesn't turn the enemies into bullet sponges, just ups the overall lethality of combat. On the hardest difficulty, the AI is smarter, bullets seem to do more damage and it goes from feeling like painkiller with humans to feeling like a Far Cry game. It's fantastic!

The expansions are absolute tat and have been discarded in the series timeline, don't play them.

AI uses suppressing fire to advance on you, throws grenades to flush you out(without spamming them thankfully) and actually flanks your position if possible.  10/10 AI, better than any shooter I've played before or since."
76561198083246187,1431624028,False,"Nostalgia leads us to believe some crazy things, so if you disagree with my lack of recommendation, try to consider the fact that I'm reviewing this in 2015 before negging me.

I have been wanting to play this game for a while, being a general fan of survival horror and shooters. I was also pleasantly surprised by Monolith's other 2005 shooter, Condemned.

F.E.A.R. has some nice gunplay, the slow-motion effects hold up well, and the presentation is consistently good throughout its sound design, score, and graphics. It also has some surprisingly good AI for a 10-year old product. I can see why in 2005 it was a hit in the Hollywood Action Game genre.

But we've played 10 years of horror and shooter games since then.

I recommended Condemned (and still do) because it does things differently that are still pretty unique today. It focuses on melee combat. Guns are scarce, as should be the case in survival horror. It has forensic tools and a mystery to solve. Combined with a very intense atmosphere (especially in the last couple of levels), it's an imperfect but very interesting specimen.

F.E.A.R. doesn't have any elements that haven't been recycled and improved through countless iterations after it. I guess bullet time stuff is not that common, but slow motion itself doesn't save the game from feeling boring and tired.

The biggest issue comes from the total lack of atmosphere. Many shooters are gray and brown, but this one's just gray. Early on in the game after fighting through 14 warehouses, I thought to myself sarcastically, ""Well at some point I'm gonna fight through a sewer and an office complex I guess."" The next two main sections of the game were a sewer and an office complex. There is also a dilapidated apartment building to vary things up. The level design feels straight out of the 90's corridor shooter rulebook - every room and path at right angles, endless amounts of zigzagging corridors way too long to be realistic, random recycled assets such as barrels and crates, and very few unique rooms that feel any different from the previous and the next. In fact, while writing this sentence, I was thinking of the original DOOM as reference, and I can safely say that there are more memorable design choices with its maps than in this game. Half-Life 2 came out a year earlier and still tops F.E.A.R. in every respect.

It's a shame, because I played this game hoping that the atmosphere is precisely what I would enjoy; I like the idea of a shooter influenced by Japanese horror. Sadly, it feels like a dated and drab military shooter with a couple of hallucinations peppered throughout to break up the monotony. There were times where I had actually forgotten the scary little girl even existed since the game was so focused on its monotone combat encounters. When the girl does appear, it can be mildly startling at times, but there aren't any real good jump scares. Not one. The major hallucinations, where your character suddenly finds himself in another place, lack tension because you quickly learn that most of them can't hurt you. They're just interactive cutscenes with some bloody and/or fiery walls and a few allusions to your character's role in all of this.

F.E.A.R. has a decently dramatic (albeit cliché) backstory, but it is revealed too late and without any impact through the use of !!! radio comms as exposition. For a game that throws you into an alternate dimension every half hour, these dimensions could have been used to *show* the drama in a much more visceral way. And if the game's central mystery/twist was trying not to be obvious, it failed completely.

So there you have it. The game's central strength is its action combat, which still isn't that bad but nevertheless clunky by today's standards. The story and voice acting are useless, and the disappointing horror elements are kept to a tensionless minimum. That's why in *2015*, without any nostalgia glasses on, it is not worth playing F.E.A.R.


Note: Steam only sells F.E.A.R. along with its expansions. While a nice bonus, they were made by a different developer, and their stories were subsequently contradicted and de-canonized by F.E.A.R. 2. For this reason, I won't play them. I guess I might, I dunno. Yeah I probably will. Definitely."
76561198066941133,1431476357,True,"This game is really cool and awesome. The story line is MEH but everything else is amazing. My favourite thing about this game is the physics engine.

76561197987047936,1431142591,True,"Should you play F.E.A.R.? Yes, absolutely. It's an excellent psychological horror FPS that does a great job of mixing action and scares, leaving you guessing as to what comes next. The story is excellent, and the slow build of the mystery kept me interested and eager to find more. The horror has lost some of its impact on what I think is my fifth playthrough, but it still got me tense and jumpy, especially towards the end.

76561197993750851,1430858629,True,"Honestly with a name like F.E.A.R., when I first played it I was expecting... well more fear lolol. But despite that, this game IS a classic. The storyline was intriguing and the AI and actual FPS gameplay was well done. I think the FEAR AI has been one of the most applauded AI of it's time for the shear tactics employed by the enemies. Really well done. If you are willing to go through the dated graphics (and trust me I seriously think it's worth it), then I think you will have a good time on your hands.

F.E.A.R. - Extraction Point continues the story where the original F.E.A.R. left off. Again, a lot of good storyline, good enemy AI, and there is some actual fear in this iteration... really there was. Some good creepy moments to be had.

F.E.A.R. - Perseus Mandate is another piece of the puzzle, although I think with a separate/alternate timeline of events. Uses the base game so the AI is good, but I got a lot more darkness and creepy vibe with this version. Really warped feel to it. Good play."

76561198097726605,1429591857,True,Very functional FPS with some decent scares and atmosphere. Doesn't do anything incredibly well but doesn't mess anything up either.
76561197997978311,1429478790,True,"This game is still one of the best I have ever played. If you're not good with horror, it's obviously not something I can recommend whatsoever. However, if you play this game for the first time, try to immerse yourself, and you'll hopefully be scared shitless, I sure was, the first time at least.

Considering the time it was made, it has held up very well in all aspects, except for visually, but it is generally only noticeable in cutscenes.

The shooting in this game is very solid, with a few very entertaining weapons, and quite decent expansion packs even. From what I've seen of others playing it, if you have no sense of direction, you will get lost as there is no map or anything obvious pointing you in the right direction. But generally, if nothing has happened or a while, you're probably not going the right way, as F.E.A.R. has minor things happening constantly to keep you alert and informed that you're going the right way.

I'm having a hard time to say anything bad about this game, that's how good it is. But, if you're going into F.E.A.R. expecting a horror masterpiece, sure it's better than the later installments, you will probably not be too impressed. F.E.A.R.  is a very solid first person shooter, with a horror setting, not a horror game with FPS elements."

I had to restart the game because I did poorly choice and ended up being constantly killed by a damn robot xD ALSO conserve ammo the most you can, because it is needed!

76561197998985381,1428757945,False,"If you like playing the game in 20~23 FPS, then go forward.

This game has a bug when the system has multiple ""HID-Compliant Devices"", reducing the framerate to around 22fps after ten or fifteen minutes of gameplay. The only known solution/workaround is to disable such devices in your Windows Device Manager. This is an awful solution, as it can disable important devices the user uses, and may require a reboot.

For this reason alone, I do not recommend this game.

However, if you manage to keep the framerate at acceptable levels, or if such low framerate does not bother you; then you can find an enjoyable experience. The gameplay itself is good, the sound effects and voice acting are also good, the in-game music and cut-scene-ish effects help delivering a great atmosphere. The graphics are somewhat dated by today standards, but are not bad. I didn't like the gunplay that much (imprecise guns, bullet-sponge feeling), and I prefer using the standard pistol most of the time."

"
76561198008064851,1428659101,True,"GOOD THINGS: Good gunplay and tense environments. Enemy AI is heavily scripted, but in a fairly restricted corridor shooter that's not a bad thing. Enemies will try to flank you, throw grenades around the corner and rush you in groups. They also have call-outs depending on the situation (when there are 1-2 left in a group they call for reinforcements, for example [no, reinforcements don't actually show up]). Decent variety of weapons, and none of them felt like you would run out of ammo for them if you use them appropriately. 

BAD THINGS: Visuals are obviously a bit dated with some lower-res textures (and almost Wind Waker level fire animations) but certainly holds ujp well enough to be playable. Game had almost comically obvious shifts between scary time and shooty time, so I almost always knew what sections would or wouldn't hold enemies. The ""scary"" bits are all jump scares, and I actually felt the tenseness of sneaking around combat sections trying to get the drop on enemies to be far greater than anything the scary sections had.

All in all, a pretty solid shooter. Took me 8 hours on a blind run on the highest difficulty, so not too big a time-sink. I do recommend going with the highest difficulty you can handle (but make sure to quicksave often if you're on the highest diff, you can drop in seconds if you walk in the open without realizing enemies are there)."
76561198165525948,1428607623,True,"I am a fan of survival horror. My favourites are Silent Hill 1-3 and Resident Evil 1-3.
Usually I am disappointed by so call new survival horror games such as Resident Evil 5, Dead Space. These are good games but not great examples of survival horror genre.

F.E.A.R.  actually caught me as a surprise. I've got goose bums and shivers few dozen times. That is quite rare. 
And all of this due to good atmosphere and games ability to keep a right amount of unpredictable tension during the game.

+Atmosphere (rare chance to feel psychological horror)
+Sound
+Gameplay (ability to use slow motion makes everything x10 awesome. Somehow I did not notice this feature during first half of the game :D)
+Great AI (enemies don't run straight into you while you are shooting at them, they take cover, shoot from corners, try to surround you whenever they can)
+Nice variety of guns

-Repetitive levels
-Not impressive graphics (well you play this game not for graphics anyway. Explosions are good though :))
-Story is a little bit lacking for my taste. Forgettable. 


Don't play it on normal difficulty it's way too easy. Unless you are new to FPS."
76561198051697533,1428508174,True,"FEAR has aged remarkably well. Graphics don't look dated, AI feels fresh even in 2015, sound and art design mean the game feels modern even if it's almost a decade old at this point. The physics engine also lends a hand to this impression, enemies fly when killed with a shotgun and ragdolls create an incredibly visceral experience.

Gunplay is similarly satisfying. Even on the higher levels of difficulty, shotguns (my favorite weapon) and other weapons do appropriate amounts of damage. Difficulty isn't ramped up by turning the enemies in to bullet sponges, instead, it makes enemies' weaponry more dangerous to you. Instead of having to pump shot after shot into the head of a Monolith trooper, you have to stay nimble and approach battles from a more tactical perspective to minimize time spent in enemy crossfire.

As far as horror elements go, FEAR is clearly influenced by The Ring and other Japanese horror themes. Jump scares don't feel as cheap as they do in other games, but FEAR isn't primarily a horror game so much as a shooter with horror elements. The ambience is great with darkly lit levels that can be temporarily lit up with your rechargeable flashlight. However, it's hard to be properly scared when equipped with a set of grenades and the ability to slow time. My approach to battles was to pick off outlying/particulary dangerous enemies with long range weapons before closing the gap using the slow time ability and eviscerating the remaining foes with my shotgun.

If you're looking to be scared, this probably shouldn't be your top choice. The cutscenes and pseudo-quicktime events with Alma are creepy, invisible enemies will make you jump, but nothing is too terribly terrifying. On the other hand, if you're looking for a solid FPS with excellent atmosphere, FEAR is a perfect choice."
76561197998323610,1428390164,True,"This is easily one of the best FPS of all time. 

The graphic still holds up surprisingly well in 2015 especially with downsampling, forced AA + soft shadow + SSAO, indoor environment has sharp texture, excellent lighting and shadow effect.

Sound effect is also excellent, you can turn on EAX if you have one of those supported soundcards. Good sound effect truly makes a different in horror games. The gun blazing sound effect in slow-mo is beautiful just like in the movie Matrix.

The game features some of the best supernatural horror sequences and firefights in traditional FPS. The enemy AI is one of the best in gaming history, and it makes the singleplayer so much more fun to play. The enemy reponds to your action very intelligently, but even on extreme difficulty, with help of slow-mo and proper positioning, you can still win most fights without too much effort. Unlike the bots in Call of Duty Veteran difficulty, the super soldiers in F.E.A.R. don't have superhuman reflex and aims, you can stealth kill a lot of them if you are careful enough. The enemy AI is smart but never cheat, it makes the game fun but never frustrating.

Good selection of weapons, all the weapons even the pistols are useful and feels powerful. It features one of the most powerful shotguns in FPS: good range, fast reload time, plenty of ammo, and powerful enough to one shot most soldier to pieces (literally) at point-blank. At bit overpowered in singleplayer, but it is a lot of fun.

The story is actually quite good for a FPS.

Bottom line, if you like blood (lots of blood) and dismemberment, then you will like this game. These over the top gore effect are very exaggerated and can be rather hilarious at times, but entertaining nonetheless.


I had fond memories of this game back in 2005. I replayed it again and in my opinion, it still holds up pretty well against mordern FPS. It saddens me to see this legendary PC series going downhill over the past years, I hope someday we will get a good sequel it deserves, or a remaster maybe?"

One of the best horror shooter games i've played, if you played and liked DOOM 3 and Resident Evil 4 give this game a shot. It's great."
76561198083644653,1427614607,True,"I love F.E.A.R., but it frustrates me. It's three different games stuck together; there's the moderately atmospheric but never scary horror game; there's the gray, [b] unbelievably [/b] repetitive corror shooter which is almost entirely set in office buildings or generic underground facilities; finally there's an incredible tactical shooter which feels and looks great and combines both old school and modern sensibilities. 

F.E.A.R. thinks it's scary, and maybe it could be if it'd commit. Although being so powerful diminishes horror, the non-combat sections could have been scary or tense if they weren't so rigidly divorced from the rest of the game and entirely predictable. Alma had potential, but you quickly realize she poses no threat. The hallucinitory segments are visually striking but unintercative and poorly presented. At times the atmosphere works, but F.E.A.R. is just afraid to commit to fear.

Worse than that though, is the environment design. Do you like gray? This is your game. Do you like office buildings, water treatment facilities, and warehouses? Have at it, friend. With such drab and repetitive environments, the linearity sticks out like a sore thumb. It's as if they had a binder of environmental designs, but lost most of it in a fire except the most boring parts, and didn't have time to make any more. For a game with such great lighting effects, the endless labyrinths of grey and off-white are shameful.

For all of that negativity, the game has one saving grace. The shooting. It's rare to play a game where guns feel so powerful. A shotgun at close range is likely to straight up tear weaker enemies in half; enemies jerk about under hails of assault rifle fire; the HLV Penetrator (fun fact, for a long time, thanks to the game's font I thought it was the HIV Penetrator), which is basically the Stake Gun from Painkiller, nails enemies to the walls; unlike in most games, explosions leave parts of enemies throughou the room. Bullets leave craters on the walls and floors, papers go flying,  windows shatter, and hanging lamps flicker and swing from the force of explosions. Every weapon feels, well, like a deadly weapon should.

However, the enemies in F.E.A.R. are surprisingly smart. They will try to flank you, throw grenades to get you out of cover, and move quickly if under fire. Every encounter is intense as you die quickly, and you will have to use health packs and armor wisely since none of it regenerates. Most fights have at least two routes of approach, so your postioning matters. Really your only advantage is the slow motion, which besides letting you see every visceral detail, gives you time to aim and think. Most shooters could learn a thing or two from F.E.A.R. about combat. 

Oh and there's a story too, but very little actually happens, and I rarely had any reason to think about it

Unfortunately, F.E.A.R.  suffers from the boring environmental design and the noticably segmented gameplay, which is a crying shame, since its gleefully visceral combat and consistently intelligent enemies are light years above and beyond any thing most games offer. If you can put up with those problems this is definitely worth you money. 10/10 for combat, 5/10 for everthing else."

76561198028383714,1427496840,True,"An extreme classic. 2005 graphics of course but I learned to ignore that. It has a good and balanced combination of horror and action and they didn't make it so difficult that I wanted to break my computer every time I died.

76561198181189369,1427426575,True,"One of the best & underpreciated FPS's of last generation, a gem that I hold on par with Half Life 2 or Bioshock. Bringing a unquie blend of horror met with a John Woo film. 

Why do I hold it on such a high regard? Offering a odd & condeluted story, but well above the average shooter story offering for atleast being interesting while entertaining for what it is. Dated visuals at this point, but holds up with wonderful particul effects for gun envirment dammage & physic's. High production sound design. with fitting soundtrack & great combat/ enviromental sound effects (Many of said effects sound unusally similar to another great Monalith title, Condemned.) Then finally the stellar gunplay,  that's the main reason for price of admission. The top notch combat of this game could warrent a review dedicated to that aspect alone, but lets run it down. Tight old school shooter controls, terrific enemy A.I thats the penniacle of enemy intelligence I hold shooters to this day, met with right kind of fun weaponary needed for the job (Shotgun & Rail Gun are a overpowered blast, pun not intended) All stacked onto a enjoyable yet very tactical slo mo drenched 'gun fu'  John Woo inspired thrill ride.

 In short, it may not pack the same quality story telling nor characters some more renowned shooters may have. Plus brought down with some medicore horror that is there more or less to do no more than give a break of pace from its frantic combat. But its the best of the best at what 'shooters' should strive for, & that's terrific gun totting gameplay."

76561198035927833,1427321077,True,"So just a few things to point out.

This game in my opinion is not a horror title, but just very bizarre and surreal at points. The level design and pacing follows a cycle of fighting and bizarre story elements. It repeats this cycle as well.

The weapons are nothing really to boast about, as they're quite generic and uninteresting design-wise. Bullet time however seems to balance this factor out and make fights interesting. Mind you, this game doesn't fuck around with difficulty, as weapons HURT and a horde of enemies will kill you fast if you're not paying attention. Some parts can be exceptionally difficult first playthrough, but you can overcome it if you figure out what you're doing.

Graphics-wise, this game has not aged well at all. The texturework and models look extremely bland nowadays, and the lighting is nothing to brag about either. As for environments? They're pretty nice, so I can't complain.

One of the things about this game that is really good is that it approaches a situation differently than most linear FPS titles. A conflict will most likely not be like the last, and that's enough to keep me hooked.

Pick this up when it's on sale or if you wanna have a good time, I recommend it."

76561197997834653,1427206254,True,A masterpiece on all levels. The lightning engine is to this day the best I've ever experianced. The textures might be dated but this is still one of the best looking games I've ever played to this day.  The combat is incredible and feels tight and responsive on the right hardware.

76561198063020430,1427018767,True,Best game in horror-fps type and series of F.E.A.R
76561197977505065,1426992790,True,"Once upon a time I was deathly afraid of this game, it was the first horror game I played, yes that means I never was a Resident Evil kid, sue me.  Anyway, also being fairly new to PC gaming and FPS, it was a shock to the system.  It didn't help that because it was PC, not a console, I was right up on the screen, in the mix of the action, instead of safe distance away on a couch or a bed.  That very first supernatural encounter where you chase the person around the corner and then they're not there...done, Alt+F4, Start menu, Unistall.  Luckily my friend Lanza was nice enough to gift me the entire series on here some years later and I had the nads to try it once more.  Sure it's outdated now, but I think it's fun, and I'm conquering my fear, you should too, enjoy some good ole' fashioned creepy vibes and ambience."
76561198056516209,1426978051,True,"A solid FPS with genius gunplay. However, once you get bored of the shooting, the game has little to offer, as the scares also stop being scary quite quickly."
76561198036958978,1426962090,True,"It may have a bad graphic but It's very scary for me.
The story is good.
You don't need much time to end this game."
76561198084414806,1426933081,True,"I came across F.E.A.R. while looking for papers on artificial intelligence to reference for my Master's thesis. Even a decade after release, the AI stands out as being the smartest I've ever fought: enemies are programmed to find cover and reposition themselves based on the player's current position, which leads to them flanking and circling behind the player, or throwing grenades to flush you out.  In short, they act very much like humans, and when you hear them freak out after you've wiped out half the squad or realise they're the only one left, it feels pretty awesome.  The well-designed levels help too, as enemies rarely have only one way to approach you, allowing firefights to remain tense.

That said, F.E.A.R. isn't just a tactical shooter with great AI. It could be described as a first-person-shooter written as a horror movie. The horror here doesn't really rely on jump scares, although they do show up, but overall it relies on atmosphere and being generally creepy, with randomly banging doors and unnerving sound effects. Some levels have few enemies - on occasion, there are none at all - and some parts will lapse into reality-warping hallucinations caused by a girl in a red dress. Even after playing through the game a few times, and remembering where these parts occur, I found it quite hard to [i]not[/i] spam bullets - if I even had a gun at that point.

Finally, a note about the expansions. Extraction Point is set after the events of F.E.A.R and uses the same player character, but has a greater emphasis on horror and is even creepier. Perseus Mandate takes place during and just after F.E.A.R., places you in the shoes of a different character, and gives you some different (and tougher) enemies, but other than that is pretty much the same. These are offically not part of the series canon, which is a pity, because they are well-made expansions and definitely worth playing.

Overall, I consider this one of the greatest FPS games ever made, and highly recommend it."
76561198075297873,1426822755,True,"Well I'll start with the dislike since there is only one, it has issues with Windows 7, it works flawlessly on some, but not other machines. Now for the pros, The game as a whole is really addictive, I just finished a marathon run through of F.E.A.R, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, and I give this game two thumbs way up. I was kept on the edge of my seat, always on the alert for what ever evil plot the game had in store for me next. I loved it, if you like freaky FPS type games Like the old Duke Nukem 3D or the I.D software DOOM games, Give F.E.A.R a shot."
76561198071749678,1426806299,True,"Playing this game, even after so many years, is being an absolute blast. Especially now when comparing the rig I had back in the day, and this now where the game is going smooth at locked 60 fps, and being played how its creators have envisioned.

Besides, other memories are tied to majority of my friends, who were like ""Dude, this sick s**t... I'm not even... I mean what the... This little girl, and.. dark and... I just couldn't. Start>>>uninstall after 10 mins in..."" I don't know but, personally, I didn't find it THAT scary. Maybe I'm weird, or maybe I had Doom3 in the year before, where it trained me well with its cheap-as* tricks with monsters spawning behind your backs,  who knows.

So, yeah, the game is called F.E.A.R. Nice play of words which also stands for First Encounter Assault and Recon, special unit made for investigating and battling paranormal activities. You were just transferred into it, nameless protagonist referred simply as ""Point Man"", a dude whos inhuman reflexes earned him his place there, which are presented in-game as a slo-mo, or bullet time. Previously seen in Max Payne games, but found a great place in a FPS game as well.

With the help of unknown forces, Paxton Fettel, a psychic commander (also a canibal who enjoys human flesh...) escapes from his confinement, and has a command over a whole battalion of telepathically controlled military clones. Its up to you to stop him, and investigate the ties with the Armacham Corporation, and the little girl known as Alma (who's ghostly presence is here for scary moments), while collecting the pieces of the puzzle by advancing through the chapters and listening to the voice messages or hacking computers.

Majority of the game you'll spend battling Fettel's Replica Forces, or occasional Armacham security personel, which doesn't make much of a difference, except for the different models used. Of course, its not some scary experience unless you are playing alone (the lesson which FEAR3 maybe didn't learn), so you won't see any use of your FEAR colleagues, or DELTA Force companions. You may arrive with some of them at the scene, but soon you'll venture alone to pull some switch, just to find them lying in pieces in the lake of blood after getting back...

Action in this game is just stellar. Awesome sound design, fires and explosions are looking amazing, particles and sparcles bursting around when highly destructable terrain comes under fire, holes leaving on concrete surfaces (this game is just rich with those) bursting in dust coulds when fired upon, grenades shaking ground and causing nearby light sources to blink, or enemies to lose the balance (if not killed by those),... There's a variety of weapons and grenade types, but my personal favorite is the SMG. Effects and sounds this weapon is producing are so sweet, its such a shame that I have to stop shooting sometimes to reload it. Out of ammo already? But I don't want to use anything else... Oh well, whatever works, I guess.

AI is still better than what 99% of other games can muster. Enemies are even reacting to your flashlight, and as soon as they spot you their first reaction is diving into closest cover available. Heck, if there's no cover at all they'll make it by turning the furniture, or try to block your way with those. If you flank them they'll try to minimize the effect of it by running backwards to the next available cover while still shooting at you. In fact, Replicas are even more scary than Alma's freaks (which you'll face occasionaly every 30 mins of hard boilled action). Nothing causes a jump scare like stumbling upon them around the corner, or surprisingly after opening some door. Is he going to shotgun my face? M I going to eat his foot or his grenade? Fighting 3 of them without using slo-mo grants you quick death, even with full body armor and health (moderate difficulty level). Slo-mo serves like a cheat mode which gives you the edge over them. How much AI is smart you can see by activating the slo-mo, they immediately figure out that they are screwed over while yelling ""Oh shieeeee..."", or ""Oh fuuuuu...""...

They love throwing grenades so much. Camp in the cover for too long and you can be sure you'll eat it. He is falling down, but ba*tard still managed to throw one down to your nose with his last breath. Boom, back to checkpoint. God help you if you forgot to quicksave since checkpoints are so far away, nothing kills your mood to play further like these things. But AI isn't perfect by any means. You can clearly hear your footseps since you are threading like an elephant, but they can't, so you can just walk to them and melee if you see their backs. Sometimes they are killed by their own grenade for hitting accidentally a part of some fence (physics in this game goes so far that even rocket launcher projectiles are colliding mid air, including with bullets). At least they can taste their own medicine sometimes, and so can you when your own grenade explodes in your face for being shot mid air with gun fire.

Their reaction to your shots is very realistic, followed by sounds of every bullet hitting their body armor. But while they are ""dancing"" under fire they'll still try hard to hit you or shoot you, depending on your stance. You'll also have issues with aiming yourself when being shot at. Pretty much everything you can do to them they can do to you. Melee attacks in this game are very deadly, especially your own jump kick which will one hit every regular unit. There's also a special type of cloacked clone combating without any weaponry. 

Graphics are very detailed even by today's standards, special reward goes to the shadows and their relationship with light sources. They are often overused, hiding low textures here and there. Shadows are so deep you have a feeling that shooting will leave holes in them. There's no much of variety in level design, very linear game full of offices and concrete surfaces. Still, there are some hidden spots, and snooping around pays off for finding reflex and health boosters, while backtracking is mostly minimized. You can see your whole body including legs, and when using variety of melee attacks, while sounds which your equipment is producing while moving/fighting are giving a better feel of weight to the whole thing.

There's not much to say about multiplayer since its servers were shut down long ago, while music is almost non-existent and plays occasionaly during larger fights, or longer nightmares caused by Alma.

For some reason, I don't seem to be able to review expansion packs separately, so I have to use external links to those.

Although who cares about how the levels look when the gameplay is so solid. I just played this game now in 2015 and it's still an awesome game. My one complaint with this game is even on the hardest difficulty it is still a bit too easy. The reason people love or hate this game is because its focus is the same gameplay over and over in different variations so if you don't like the shooting mechanic you will pretty much hate the whole game."

This was a replay for me, having first played FEAR some years ago. I had fond memories of the game and thought it time to revisit it. I’m glad I did. The game has a wonderfully spooky and tense atmosphere and outdoes many more recent titles in this respect (it still startled me on several occasions). The graphics are pretty good given the game’s age. It comes from the era when FPSs were commonly set in research facilities, abandoned factories, and office buildings, and this lack of diversity in the environments is one of the game’s weaknesses. As is the lack of humour -- there are no laughs here. But the game’s strengths lie in the atmosphere and in the combat. There is a palpable sense of apprehension as you sneak along the corridors under the flickering lights. The AI is crafty and the combat is always fun, especially when using the slo-mo, or bullet-time, ability, which is flawlessly implemented. If you like a good old-fashioned FPS with loads of atmosphere and plenty of exhilarating combat you can’t go far wrong with this classic.

This is a great FPS, and there are parts of the game that are actually scary. The enemy AI is a real challenge, and the gameplay is awesome! It's really ""atmospheric"", full of suprises, scares and many cool gunfights! I bought the two expansion packs (which are newer) and they are as good, if not better than the main game! Oh yeah, this game also has a decent storyline too. The Multiplayer option is gone, but even if you just like a fun ""shooter"", you'd like this game!"

TL;DR Solid horror shooter 8/10"
76561198044271573,1426207410,False,"Not sure why this gets such great reviews.. I felt lost half of the time. Not knowing whether or not I was making any progress until I hit a random checkpoint in what looked like somewhere I had already been before. A lot of the levels felt the same and the shooting felt rather clunky and inaccurate. Even on normal difficulty this game can be pretty tough if you don't find the ammo or healthpacks that you WILL need, but after dropping to easy difficulty, it was near impossible to die and the FPS aspect got really boring. Although it had some creepy moments and got me once or twice with a jumpscare, there definitely wasnt enough ""horror"" to balance out the FPS to really consider this as ""one of the best horror games"". It's not a BAD game, but it does not impress me or live up to what I have heard about the series (which apparently goes downhill from here...)

76561197976075651,1425853027,True,"F.E.A.R. -

Great game for it's time. It's aged pretty darn well. When it came out, I would have likely given it a 9.5 out of 10. It's got some flaws (I think, they just might be me viewing it from the current FPS market). As of right now, I'd give it a solid 8/10. Highly recommended.

The DLC... that's another story. It makes an adaquate FPS. 
The first DLC, Extraction Point I'd give a 1/10. Not worth playing. I did, but I wouldn't again.
Perseus Mandate: 4/10. Better, but really not worth playing.
Gameplay wise, it's the same. It's just not scary, which the game is known for. Instead of using different and new tricks to scare you like the first game, it relies on the first game's most rare scary tactic for 100% of the scares. Because of that, it really makes it feel un-scary since you know exactly what is going to happen and when it's going to happen. It totally sets you up for it and you're like ""OH THERE'S THAT GREY CIRCLE GEE I BET GHOSTS COME OUT OF IT AND OVERSTAY THEIR WELCOME WHILE IN THE FIRST GAME IT DIDN'T GIVE YOU A GREY CIRCLE AND INSTEAD SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME.""

Overall, I'd give the package an 8/10. Play F.E.A.R. Play the expansions if you want a mediocre shooter without the scares or story."

- very linear
- repetitive environment
- rather short (took me 6,7 hours to finish)

This is a bit of old classic. I recommend it to anyone interested in titles that took part in writing the history of video-gaming. The game combines action revolving around a slow-motion effect and some horror elements (a few scares and disturbing imagery). While the former works quite well (hearing enemies curse in slow motion while you blast them away with shotgun is priceless:), the horror part is in my opinion a bit tryhard and in later stages gets obtrusive. Overall F.E.A.R. is definetely worth playing if you enjoy atmospheric games which don't compromise too much on action.

Pros 
Enemy AI (one of the best to this day, they play better than your average CS player :))
Story
Atmospheric
Precise Gun play
Great Sound track
Nice sound effects


Cons

Visuals are getting little dated
Some jump scares are ""cheap""

Spin offs - 
Extraction Point 

More of the same, athmosphere is little better than in original F.E.A.R.
No jump scares at all.
Story is scraped at start of F.E.A.R. 2 though

Perseus Mandate

Totaly boring generic shooter, all athmospheric elements of original are gone"

I recomend this game to anyone that likes a good FPS. I give it a rating of 9/10"
76561197968478429,1424643954,True,"I must have played this game fifteen times now and I still enjoy it every time I play it. The combat is tight, the sound is top notch, the guns feel powerful and are fun to use, and the AI gives you a nice challenge. This review is for single player only, because gamespy no longer exists, and you cannot play the multiplayer section of the game anymore.

I'm going to split this up into a few distinct sections because there is a lot to talk about in this game.

The game came out right when first person shooters were getting popular again, and it shows heavily in the design. There are obvious influences of Half-Life 2, Doom 3 and Halo/Halo 2 across the board, but it manages to combine some of the better aspects of each of these games together into a cohesive product. You have limited weapon slots and health kits, but it takes the route of giving you slow motion and allowing you to store the health kits to modernize the gameplay aspects.

The graphics style and technology has aged fairly well, and has a distinct ""Doom 3"" look to it with sharp shadows, dark environments and fairly rough polygonal models, but still manages to capture what the developers were going for. Texture resolution is fairly good, and there are a lot of fine details that you can pull in if you look around. I really love the bullet decals and the way they utilized parallax mapping to make it look like chunks of the wall are missing. It comes out very natural.

The environments are not very varied and it shows that the engine was not well optimized with open areas, leading to the feeling of wandering through endless corridors without much variety. They tried to spice things up by changing locations every so often, but this is one of the bigger complaints you'll find with the game. Most of the events take place inside warehouses, office buildings, and the occasional ""sewer"".

The sound in this game is top notch. Weapon sounds are sharp and booming, and compliment the visual look of the weapons perfectly. Enemies and allies are all well voice acted and have a large number of lines they can pick from situationally. The music is well produced and compliments the scenes taking place within the game, leaving you immersed but helping to hype you up for what is going on. The environmental effects fit well, and none of the sounds stand out as feeling off or out of place. Even the spooky scary sounds have their place, and feel well integrated. Monolith has always excelled here and this game is no exception.

The weapons are fun to use and feel powerful, both in your hands and in those of the enemies. The shotgun is easily one of the most satisfying weapons I've used in a game in a long time, capable of literally blowing people to a fine mist at close range, and cutting them into chunks at moderate range. The penetrator shoots massive metal spikes that will nail people to walls in the most insane poses. There are also akimbo pistols.

Combat is intense and thrilling, and when combined with the startlingly good AI and the slow motion it just comes with you feeling like a bad ass, while still being challenging and fun. The developers said they wanted it to feel like the opening scene to Hard Boiled, and they were 100% successful, sparks, dust and debris everywhere. With how reactive and varied the AI can be during a fight you get a decent amount of variety out of the fights.

The game has fairly good pacing, and a reasonable difficulty curve with various little spikes of difficulty scattered through to keep things interesting. Monolith knew that combat wasn't interesting if it was all you did, and so added in a bit of exploration and toned back sections to let you recover from the high intensity fighting. The game expects you to begin using your weapons more effectively, and to use the tactics you've learned and the environments to your advantage, so you never feel like things quite settle down.

I want to give the AI in this game a special mention, because it is particularly well done. Combining a dynamic squad system, flanking tactics and staggered reload pinning techniques, the AI is surprisingly lifelike. It has a fairly advanced sense system, and the individual enemies have a brain of information they retain and can share using verbal call outs, and will often react to stale information in surprisingly realistic ways. Each enemy can be scared, demoralized and manipulated, leading to unique behaviors. The only problem with this is that combat is typically too short to see a lot of this behavior emerge unless you are at a higher difficulty level. It shows that the developer put a lot of love into the AI.

This game is supposed to be scary, or maybe just creepy, and it is usually successful on the first play through. With a clever combination of supernatural powers, disturbing imagery, jump scares and sound hits, you're kept on edge. The sometimes predictable scares lose their impact as the game goes on,, but there is still plenty to love about the game even without this aspect. If you absolutely hate scary games, this is not for you.

I strongly suggest that you at least give the game a try if you enjoyed one of the games that helped to shape this game(Half-Life 2, Doom 3, Halo). For the price, it's hard to go wrong. If on sale, it's even harder to go wrong!

P.S. The expansion packs for this game will likely leave you wondering where the magic went. They don't have the same polish or enjoyment factor. The review is focused on the main game only."

76561197991858109,1424612811,True,"By far one of my favourite FPS, F.E.A.R. knows just how to cut a fine balance between spooking you out and having you blow the heads off of enemies with a shotgun in bullet time.

It's not a horror game."
76561197995355610,1424510656,True,"This game has a very real feel about physics and shooting. Maybe we may call it a pioneer in this genre but has its downsides which are repetitive battles, a cheesy story, never ending enemies, linear routes and boring raido messages."
76561198096887049,1424484932,True,"Started off creepy (which is awesome.) Gets dry, and then creepy.
Creepy is great, you wander around in empty areas, looking for enemies while paranormal noises and activity occasionally happens. This is awsome. There is no stupid monster bullshit, the game paired with the audio makes you have a neck hair raising experince where you'd rather not play with your surround headphones and the lights off. But you do. You will find yourself looking over your shoulder at times when you actually get spooked and feel that someone is standing over your shoulder. If you like FPS and Amnesia, you will cum buckets over this game."
76561198002921823,1424436157,True,"The first F.E.A.R. is the best in the series and 3 is the least.

Extraction Point and F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate is not made by Monolith, and are harder and not as fun to play."
76561198017158509,1424311561,True,"Still one of the premier first-person shooters of all time. The shooting mechanics are in-depth and satisfying, with the slow-mo ability adding an intense, if unoriginal, tactical advantage. The ability to use a variety of melee attacks is also incredibly addictive, perhaps overpowered since it can kill an enemy in one hit, but this is mitigated by how easy it is to take damage if not played carefully. Great level design rewards players who move slowly and explore, and also enables the complex AI to provide a competent challenge as they flank, use grenades, communicate and ambush the player.

Beyond the gameplay, this still remains one of the best horror and story-based games as well. The scare-tactics are a bit ""in your face"" compared to some recent gems in the field of horror, but it still has a deeply disturbing atmosphere and a low-key ambient soundtrack adds to the tension.
The story is a sickening descent into the horrors unleashed by mankind's wickedness, the desire to play god, and monsters who destroy their makers."
76561198039082379,1424209276,True,"F.E.A.R. was the first horror game I ever played all the way through. I recently revisited it since I picked them all up on steam. And I got to say it holds up. Unlike most modern horrors, that show you horrific creatures mauling people or torturing them, F.E.A.R. takes a different approach. At times you almost forget that you are playing a horror game. You spend a lot of your time in office buildings and research labs encountering soldiers trying to kill you. It feels like a standard FPS game. But they sprinkle horror elements into the game throughout. Whether it is from the unerving quiet of the offices, or from glimpses of people who vanish or rooms full of blood, you are quickly reminded that something is not right. 

The FPS gameplay is solid for a game of its time. It feels reminiscant of Half Life. I recommend playing this game on the higher difficulties. This not only increases the horror of the game due to tension of ammo and health supply but also makes the game more of a challenge. F.E.A.R. has a slow motion ability that you can use for a short amount of time, and it recharges over time. On easier difficulties, this makes the game a breeze. On harder difficulties, I found myself saving it for when I truly needed it. I recommend checking out pcgamingwiki.com for some tweaks to all the games. I had to increas the FOV for it. It looks a tab weird at first, but nothing that takes away from the game.

The F.E.A.R. series will always be in my short list of horrors I recommend. Definitely worth picking up if you havent played through it before, turn of the lights, put on the headphones and have at it."
76561198175487547,1424154043,True,"F.E.A.R. is a different breed of FPS. Yes, there is a lot of blood and interesting weapons but it also has the horror aspect of it. I havent gotten sick of the combat of this game either. It's always intense. Another sidenote is that F.E.A.R. does not take a wild system to run smoothly. Im playing it on a low end laptop and the graphics are still decent. For 9 bucks, you'd be stupid not to buy it"
76561198041357059,1424045322,True,It's aite.

76561198077527825,1424008376,True,"I blame this game for making me a PC gamer. I actually got it free with F.E.A.R. 2 & 3 from some site or other over a year before I finally played it, having never played it before, and I was almost instantly hooked, even though it took me 3 days to get past the first few rooms (I SUCK at FPS games mostly) but the terror-inducing tension and atmosphere was, to me, a revelation.

Seriously, don't think about it, just buy the damn game, even if you have to sell your cat/dog/goldfish/grandmother to afford it.

10/10 would sell my grandmother again if she weren't dead"
76561198064153655,1424007125,True," F.E.A.R was really exciting. Thrilling as well because of the mood and the battle was spectacular. Excluding BGM the horror side was not much in the game so you don't have to tense up too much. You will enjoy gun fighting in the dark and bloody mood. Gear up!

+) Reasonable supplies. It's just enough to make your game fun.
+) Reasonable mapping. It's just enough to make you have fun.
+) Thrilling mood. Not so much of horror but BGM covers it mostly.
+) Dramatic story that makes you melt in and the epilogue that makes you want to play F.E.A.R 2 badly."
76561198016911712,1423935020,True,"The game may be old and the graphics not top notch, but I bet it will make you jump a least once if not more, its a great game and loads of fun, It gets spooky and with music and back ground noise's to keep you on the edge of your seat its just great. For an old game I reckon it still has enough to hold any gamer. There is loads to explore,  and lots to find, from secrets, weapons, ammo, armour and routes to complete each task. enjoy."

76561198090650360,1423847080,True,"After completing F.E.A.R.3, which is one of my top favourite Co-Op games, I wanted to find out how it all started, so I picked up the first game in the series.

The graphics are old, but still decent on highest settings. It doesn't hurt the gameplay. The battlesystem is nice, with great AI behaviour, though enemies are a bit more challlenging than in F.E.A.R.3. It takes 3-4 shots before you are killed on normal difficulty. So, you should be really careful. But with slow-mos and covers it's managable and, leaving those piles of corpses behind you, makes you feel like a mass murderer. 

There are a lot of surprises in terms of enemy spawning, which adds up for a nice challenge. You don't get bored, because as soon as you get used to enemies and start to think ""meh, this is too easy"", something new pops in, requiring you to adapt to the new level of difficulty.

There is not much of a story in terms of dialogues and cut-scenes. But what you have is a rather direct experience, and the story reveals itself, as you advance through enemies and levels. The sound and special effects adds up nice tension to the gameplay.

So, as a result, you get a really good semi-horror first person shooter with a nice polish. I recommend it to all players, especially, if you have played and like such games as Return to Castle Wolfenstein and F.E.A.R.3.

EXTRACTION POINT expansion: F.E.A.R. at its best. Includes more paranormal content and horror elements, engaging in very, very tense, almost psychologically tormenting, yet addicting gameplay. The enemies are more difficult, too, ranging from regular soldiers to armored units, mechs and phantoms, that will slice you up in no time.

PERSEUS MANDATE expansion: after completing Extraction Point, it will feel like a casual game. In this game you play as Pointman from the second F.E.A.R. team. There's not much of horror in this game, the focus is on different guns. Still, it is a satisfying game. 3 unlockable bonus missions included (kill all the enemies in the clinic; survive the arena; and sprint trough enemy lines).

My overall rating: 9/10

Note. There are many players saying that F.E.A.R.3. ruined the series, because there wasn't a lot of horror in it. But I liked F.E.A.R.3 better, because you could play with two characters and there is a co-op mode in it. Sure, the first game is more emotionally involving, but just a bit. It's not a big deal from me. And who gets scared by a video game anyway?"

76561198038198976,1423516482,True,"Ah, F.E.A.R. What can I say? Well, it's an excellent game that offers some solid shooting mechanics and the occasional spook. The spooks, although few and far between (this actually works in the games favour) are very effective and really add to the games already deep and eerie atmosphere. The shooting is just so well done with each gun having a nice punch to it not to mention the slow motion is very, very well implemented. The huge amounts of blood, bullet casings and smoke particles left after an intense fire fight really just look awesome and help give the game a truly cinematic feel (Ubisoft, start taking notes). The excellent shooting coupled with fantastic atmosphere and marverously well executed scares make this game action horror done just right (Capcom, also start taking notes). The story is actually quite good in F.E.A.R. Not excellent or mind blowing but pretty good granted that you don't already know the whole plot before playing which is kind of  a hard thing not to know in the modern gaming world. The music in this game is also very good. Like really, really good. It's mostly comprised of this breathy and low fi sounding music which works beautifully with the games already strong atmosphere. The enemy A.I is also very good with the enemies talking to each other and working together to try and take you down which can, at times be quite challanging. However there are some parts of F.E.A.R that really don't hold up so well. The level design is sometimes slightly maze-like and other times quite linear. F.E.A.R. also has quite a lot of frustrating backtracking which really does break up some of the tension. There also isn't much enemy variety in the game. You got shooty guy A, shooty guy B, guy with gas mask and teleporty ablities and some robots. That's about it.

Those last points aside, F.E.A.R. perfectly combines elements of action and horror to make for one hell of a game and one of my personal favourite games, let down only by it's slightly frustrating level design and lack of enemy variety.  

F.E.A.R.

76561197996671311,1423433667,True,"F.E.A.R. is something fresh to (a then...and frankly still now) stale genre of FPS.

It has great sound design in it's foley work and the music is fantastic.

Gameplay/Storytelling is old school gaming. You have to crawl across the level looking for bits of story as well as health pickups and weapons. It feels and looks a lot like Doom 3.

Graphics/Visual is good for the time sadly, much like Doom 3 , PREY, and Quake 3, the game doesn't age very well at all.

It still have scary moments and is able to tell it's story very well but, I think if I had played it almost a decade ago when it was originally released it would have had a deeper impact.

I still highly recommend you try it out during a steam sale. It's still a good olde' FPS with a little something new peppered in."

76561198006176581,1423045732,True,"I remember when I first bought this game at Best Buy. I rushed back to my college dorm to play it and proceeded to freak out to the edge-of-your-seat gameplay and creepy atmosphere. This was before I knew about Steam. I was not able to buy physical copies of the DLC and I was really bummed about that...until I saw they were included with F.E.A.R on Steam! I paid full price for F.E.A.R just so I could get those DLC and I am glad that I did. 
F.E.A.R. came out in 2005, and it really has aged. However, the gameplay and the story more than make up for the older graphics. The combat is intense, forcing you to fight through tons of soldiers by yourself in order to reach your target. The AI can be pretty annoying sometime since they can figure your tactics, and also freak out when they have realized you took out an entire squad. There is strong language throughout the game. The gore can be intense. Carnage and blood is everywhere and not just from bullets. After the firefights, Alma shows up.
The story that surrounds Alma is the reason I recommend this game. This is what I feel sets this game apart from all other FPS's. You have military combat gameplay team up with a seriously creepy and supernatural storyline. It's a terrifying combination. She may be inspired by The Ring and countless other scary movies with little girls with black hair, but she is so original, you won't have any trouble singling her out as one of the scariest forces in video games. FEAR ALMA.
Now for the DLC. They are not necessary but they are fun to play. Both are similar in length. Each one took me six hours to complete. They are not considered canon but you do learn some interesting things about the Perseus Project and Armacham.
This was a great game to play and it got my psyched for the sequel, Thought I have not played an extensive list of FPS's, I believe that this one stands apart for merging a military FPS with psychological horror."

Boring typical weapons
Long and with limited replay value (or none)

My issue:
Like Doom and a few other FPS, I tend to get sick. I mean really really sick playing this game. Something about the colours, the frame rates and the graphics actually makes me physically ill after about 20-25 minutes of play.  Not seizures but getting hot and upset stomach.

The visuals are meh since this is old. However the physics and lighting are quite impressive even today. The audio is also excellently done. What really impresses me is the AI. It takes cover. Makes cover. Actually has good movement through the different levels. It EVEN flanks you.
     I wish another developer would come along and say ""This is a wonderful implementation and a great engine."" ""Lets take this and update it and put it in our game."" Quite frankly shooters of today are generally terrible. If developers would stop copying Call of Duty and make thier own game. The genre as a whole could only benefit. I've seen shooters since the days of Quake and Halo. I'm tired of seeing this genre shitted on by lazy developers. There are some games that try to differentiate other than this one in particular. I just wish they weren't console exclusives.

I feel so bad about Alma, and scared completely crapless by her as well. PLAY IT. PLAY IT SO HARD. Even though I'm completely scared to near insanity at the end of the game, I can't help but pity her. The intensity of the game gradually grows and grows as the game progresses.

Having revisited it's actually such a fine FPS, obviously it's nothing compared to today's graphics but it runs very smooth and the AI is surprisingly intentive but the actual fire fighting in general I would say felt better and more satisfying then quite a few modern games.

Great atmosphere too and in higher difficulty item management becomes quite important.

All round I'd say it's still worth playing though better if you can get the whole collection in a special deal.

Only little cons that got me which I think is more an age of the game, never seen weapons reload so fast, melee is one-hit-kill which makes all the quite cinematic pushes and kicks more for show, can't iron sight (which doesn't make a huge difference but would make sharp shooting easier) and dialog can be a bit quiet at times."

An atmospheric game with great environments and indepth firefights- where every face-off with the enemy feels intense and a slip of the hand can cost you. 

The guns feel great, sound great, and all of them contribute. 

The expansions are lacking in the feel of the core game, but they do add some fresh firepower and a half dozen more hours of play. I personally wouldn't bother with the sequels because they were an extreme let down. I just accept the expansions as canon. [spoiler]jin ;_;[/spoiler]"

The level design and enemy variety are somewhat lacking. Grey industrial areas or office ares. But at least the developers trusted you to know which way to go. And you're literally massacring a batallion of clones. But the attention to detail tense, fast-paced combat and pretty clever enemy A.I more than make up for that. There are some technical issues you may face. Specifically with the frame rate. It doesn't like HID stuff. Turn off anything that's not essential, like your mouse and keyboard, and it'll run perfectly.
Purseus Mandate: Same strengths and weaknesses as the base game. Adds some new enemies and weapons. It's surprisingly long for an expansion and has some really nice, challenging bosses and fights in it."

F.E.A.R. is one of the best horror themed FPS's to come out of the past decade.  Intense gun battles, unique story, and a superb atmoshpere make it an unorthodox blend of genres that delivers a precedent-setting experience.  

[h1] F.E.A.R. Review (Spoiler Free) [/h1]

[b] Story [/b]

The First Encounter Asssult Recon (F.E.A.R.) is a U.S. government special ops group specializing in the investigation of paranormal events.  Players embody the ""Point Man"", a faceless, nameless protagonist as he is deployed on his first F.E.A.R. operation.  During a briefing, it is revealed that defense contractor Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) has a small problem.  A man named Paxton Fettel, with the ability to telepathically control an army of clones, has seized control of ATC's headquarters.  F.E.A.R. is sent to apprehend Fettel at another location, but he mysteriously evades capture.  What follows is a game of cat-and-mouse between Point Man and Fettel, interrrupted with paranormal phenomenon and disturbing visions involving a little girl.  Point Man pursues Fettel undeterred and in doing so, learns more about Fettel's origins and uncovers a project that ATC is attempting to conceal with alacrity.

The expansion known as Extraction Point follows Point Man after the conclusion of the main game as he tries to escape his new conditions.  In Perseus Mandate on the other hand, players inhabit a sergeant in a second F.E.A.R. team (deployed at the same time as Point Man's) to another ATC facility.  Both of these expansions provide more lore to soak up but the only canon events in the F.E.A.R. series occur in the base game according to the creators.  

[b] Gameplay [/b]

F.E.A.R. is played in first person but unlike some FPS's, Point Man's body is fully rendered (meaning if you look down you will see his feet).  This is important due to some of Point Man's abilities explained later.  Movement is fairly slow, but it makes you feel as though you are wearing a ton of gear.  Point Man can peak around objects lending to his tactical training but he also has a unique skill.  At the push of a button, players can enter ""reflex time"", essentially bullet time allowing Point Man to deal with impossible odds.  These enhanced reflexes also allow Point Man to execute elaborate melee maneuvers such as slide kicks and leaping kicks (where seeing your feet is helpful).  Thus combat is often a blend of bullet time shooting, peaking around corners for kills, and melee attacks.  The Replicate forces (Fettel's army) have extremely cunning AI though, forcing the player to adapt quickly.  Enemies will flank, use explosives to flush you out, and kite you to death if you try to rush them.  Enemies communicate with one another, reporting losses and calling for reinforcements along with other situational dialogue.  Fettel throws everything he has at you: heavily armored foot soldiers, ""Watchers"" that use guerilla tactics, and even unmanned mechs.  To deal with these threats, Point Man can carry up to three weapons, making your loadout choices very important.  Guns are not scaled in F.E.A.R., so your starting equipment works just as well as weapons found later in the game.  That being said, weapons run the gambit from the usual stock to unconventionals like lazer rifles and particle weapons.  The game will take you anywhere from five to ten hours depending on difficulty.

Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate both introduce unique weapons and equipment, however core gameplay reamains the same.  Extraction point only lasts a few hours but Perseus Mandate is almost the same length as the base game.

[b] Design [/b]

F.E.A.R.'s lighting is some of the best I've seen in gaming.  Your flashlight has to recharge after using it for a certain amount of time so there are moments in the game where you almost scare yourself.  Going down completely dark hallways is always nerve wracking.  Explosions shake overhead lights that react realistically, fires have heat distortion, glass shatters satisfyingly, and enemies ragdoll and dismember depending on where and how they are injured.   Voice acting is very good, and music is appropriately creepy or intense depending on the situation.  But, the reason this game is lauded is because you never know how it will scare you.  Walking around empty office buildings is creepy enough, but you never quite know what's around the corner.  This was the designers' intention, to make a game that was unpredictably scary, rather than just jump-scares cubed.  The result is a game that does not feel formulaic in its approach to horror aesthetics and one that will often surprise players with its use of special effects. 

[b] Final Comments [/b]

F.E.A.R.  is remembered as one of the best marriages between horror and the FPS genre of gaming.  Paced excellently and with some challenging shooter segments, F.E.A.R. may just change your opinion about what makes a great FPS truly great.  I'll never climb a ladder the same way again."
76561198022149953,1422054483,True,"I came into this game thinking it would be a run-and-gun type of game. I was completely wrong.

The AI in this game is absolutely brilliant. 
Every encounter is a challenge. 
You have to be prepared for an encounter at all times. 
You have to form a strategy quickly for each encounter and execute it without mistakes or you will die. 
You have to use slow motion for each encounter or you will die. 
Enemies don't just run at you, you have to draw them out of cover or try to flank them (which is impossible sometimes).
The levels are designed very well, leaving you with minimal cover and putting you in awkward spots where it is very difficult to advance on the enemy.
The weapons are well balanced and very fun to use.

This is an excellent FPS if you're looking for a challenging game with an interesting story. I highly recommend it!

P.S. Logitech devices make this game perform very poorly. It's something about the polling/report rate of their mice. So you have to disable the Logitech HID's in your device manager and everything should run great!

Man I was so wrong... This game is truly a great title of horror. Not because of the gore or stuff, but because of the extreme tension during the entire game. It's outstanding.

I suggest trying to search something about this Wen Chi Lee who appears in the first line of credits. The fact that there is NO information about her intensifies the mystery of the game.

76561198168660735,1420823175,True,"I knew nothing about FEAR when I started playing. It turned out to be one of my favourite shooters of all time.

The graphics stand the test of time, I played this in 2015 and it looks fantastic with everything turned to max. The level detail in the game kept supprising me.
The gameplay was one of the most fun expierences I've had with a shooter in a long time. Everything felt tight and well balanced. The gun's are all fantastic and interesting and a joy to fire. The action feels visceral and immense, the environment breaks apart around you, the lights flash and your guns feel like they have real impact.

The story seemed fairly decent although I wish it was told in a better manner. Simply walking around listening to someone tell you the background in your earpiece isn't that fun. It would have been nice to find documents to read. The game creates a really tense attmosphere at times without going to far with the jump scares. This is deffinately hinged on action horror as apose to something like Penumbra.

I did have technically problems getting the game running on a modern system. Firstly it kept crashing on startup, I fixed this by mashing space bar to skip whatever movie was making the game crash. Then I had a well known issue where the framerate would drop from 60 to 20 after a while playing, I found a workaround in the Steam forums.

It took a little fiddling to get the game running but any FPS should play FEAR, haven't had this much fun with an FPS in a long time."
76561197989621015,1420810263,True,"Amazing game. Most other horror games just goes for the scares and have you play someone defenseless which only can run away, FEAR, however, have put a lot of thought into gameplay. Many various weapons, very good AI, very good fps experience and the slow-mo makes things even better.
As for the horror, FEAR manages to build up a good creepy atmosphere, makes good use of pop-ups and have a good (but tragic) story. Also, Alma is the best horror character made. :)

F.E.A.R. is the best horror game I've played."

The game can be hard, but never unfair (or it can be easy if you go with too low of a difficulty). I'm really liking F.E.A.R. and once I finish this I will try the expansions and then F.E.A.R. 2 and F.E.A.R. 3 My only complaint is sometimes it has a weird bug with logitech mouse drivers to where the framerate will dip real low until you re-plug your mouse (very odd to say the least) and I don't have an anemic computer because on the highest settings I normally average >200 FPS at 1080p.

The horror isn't scary, the graphics are mediocre, the combat is repetative (slow-mo, shoot them all, back to real time), the story is painfully under developed with so much potential, the maps are confusing and almost maze-like, its easy with no dificulty increase. Overall I would give it a 5/10 simply because it became so repetative I just got too bored to be interested. I also want to add that I hve no idea why this game would be tagged or considered a 'horror game.' The atmosphere is non-existent, mostly due to poor lighting, there are no scary enemies or monsters. The only thing that scared me was...wait...nothing scared me. The 'horror' aspect was entirely made of jumpscare...al three or four of them. The amount of shooting the same 2 models of guys un the same corridor in the same building with the same guns for over five hours made the 'scary' parts so insignificant I can't see why they didn't just remove them. No to mention Half-Life 2 came out a year before this and is better in literally every aspect, I can't believe this game is so popular."

76561197966387903,1420268111,True,"F.E.A.R., lembro que joguei ele em 2005 qdo foi lançado mas não cheguei a terminar. Tinha achado legal pacaraio, mas com cenários meio repetitivos. Resolvi tirar a poeira do jogo e ir até o final e ver se minha visão do jogo mudava.

Ao contrário de jogos como Doom 3 e Half-Life 2, graficamente o jogo não envelheceu bem. A engine não é legal. Deus Ex 1 com Unreal Engine envelheceu melhor, e a sensação é que FEAR foi lançado em 2003, ou algo assim. Sombras duras e ambientes escuros demais te forçam a usar uma lanterna que ilumina só a curta distância. Sons ambientes são processados de forma estranha também, e o jogo no geral é bem silencioso.

Na época ele competiu com Quake 4 e a grande vantagem dele, q deu toda a atenção, foi a Inteligencia Artificial. Ela é foda. Ela faz bom uso do level design q em áreas de batalha possuem mais de um caminho, te deixando tenso sobre onde olhar, te forçando a jogar de forma mais tática. A IA é capaz de te flanquaer, pular catwalks, parapeitos e até janelas quebradas, usar cover e lean pra se proteger dos seus tiros enquanto atira, e as vezes só colocar o braço pra fora da cobertura pra atirar. Foda. Ainda to pra ver IA melhor em jogos FPS.

Combate é dificil e você toma muito dano com pouco tiro, e o jogo equilibra colocando sempre muito medkit e armor em locais de combate. Isso meio que quebra a surpresa de certos combates pq vc passa numa área com esses itens e sabe q a coisa vai ficar preta. Eu preferiria que o jogo tivesse equilibrado melhor os danos e colocado menos medkit. Por outro lado, quando você passa de um combate e não precisa usar medkit nem repor seu armor você se sente foda e q sua tática foi boa.

A história é interessante e ao mesmo tempo não. Eu não curto o quase plágio do filme O Chamado (q eu curto bastante) com a história da menina, mas no final das contas ela até q se desenvolve de forma interessante apesar de bem previsível. O jogo te dá uns sustos legítimos, principalmente nas expansões. Acho que tomei mais susto aqui do que no Outlast.

Level Design é bom, o q ajuda a IA a funcionar, pois áreas de combate geralmente tem dois caminhos. Mas o cenário se repete muito. Você passa muito tempo dentro de um prédio onde é tudo muito igual. Corredores, escritórios, copas, mais corredores, escritórios... Sem muita variedade. Nas expansões isso melhora muito.

Sobre as expansões: a primeira, Extraction Point, é continuação direta do jogo original, acaba sendo um pouco mais do mesmo, e prolonga um pouco a história do jogo que é meio curto. Foram 8hs pra terminar o original e mais 5 pra terminar a primeira expansão.

A segunda, Perseus Mandate, é bem melhor e na minha opinião obrigatória jogar se você curte o jogo. É uma história paralela muito bem encaixada com o original, mostrando eventos sobre outro angulo. As vezes lembra um pouco Half-Life, q ele se esforça pra ser, mas não chega a tanto. Foram mais 8hs de jogo que valeram muito a pena. Além dos cenários variados, eles melhoraram um pouco o engine com o lance das sombras cruas, e aqui os ambientes são um pouco mais claros e a sombras mais suaves.

Se você curte FPS e tiver o jogo empoeirado e não tiver terminado ainda, jogue, com as expansões. Se jogou o jogo original, jogue as expansões, pelo menos o Perseus Mandate."

The game it self isnt really to shabby, but it gets pretty stale after the first hour. The story is interresting and the only reason to really play it since the shooting havent really aged well, Its the same over and over the whole game. Slow time, aim for the heads, out of slowMo? Back up but and wait for it to recharge. Only play it for the story if your aiming to play all the games, if not? Play something else.


F.e.a.r: Extraction Point
I've just finished the first expansion to F.e.a.r and it didn't really add much to the game. Small bits of story mixed with bland and boring shooting. I recommend looking up the story online and skip this expansion.

F.e.a.r: Perseus Mandate
Just finished up the second story expansion for F.e.a.r and it was a dissapointment. Same ast the previous expansion the story just repeats itself with stuff you alreay know and trying to be ""scary"" and throw some twists at you that just falls flat and fails to deliver.

I have played through the entire core campaign and some multiplayer.  I have not played the Extraction Point or Perseus Mandate DLC campaigns yet.

This was an absolutely awesome game in it's time, and I still love it today, despite the dated graphics and a few little control hitches.  The story move you forward without making you feel railroaded, and solid gameplay seriously makes you feel like a bad---, particularly when the enemy soldiers start yelling in shock.

It also scared me out of my wits.  Even the jump scares are well timed so that you see something on the edge of the screen when you turn around, only to find nothing there when you actually look.

I would wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who's interested.  And play at night with the lights out.  ;-P"

Although the graphics are a little bit dated now, the directing and the voice acting are still great, and the enemy A.I. keeps you thinking quick and pushes you to think more tactfully yourself.

If you really want to enjoy the FEAR saga, I highly recommend starting with FEAR 3, then FEAR and then FEAR 2.

If you start with FEAR, you probably will stop here.

The best thing was that dark atmosphere though; it made you think as if you were alone for sure while playing it, with nobody to help and nobody to hear your scream... after defeating lots of enemies, of course. If you like that kind of games, then F.E.A.R. is for you! Do not worry about the graphic - even if this game came out back in 2005, the graphic is still nice for eyes."

Music : The ambient music helps the atmosphere and the battle themes are catchy.

Visual Arts : Grim & Beautiful , Helps in setting the atmosphere for the game.

76561198089169247,1419449072,True,"7/10

What a superb thriller. Not as many ""jumpy"" scare moments as in Dead Space, FEAR instead takes a long story telling approach to it's scare tactics. 
At times, it did feel to drag out. Especially around the middle sequences, the levels and missions can start to feel very repetative. I presume this has alot to do with the aging of the game as the level design is not as intricate so each area does not seem ""fresh"". 

However, for a 10 year old game this hold up SO WELL. I really appreciate all the video options. I did have problems with HID compliant devices causing the framerate to drop but disabling those quickly fixed the problem. 

Now on to Extraction Point!"
76561197982630348,1419426296,True,"While I admit this game is one of my favorites games ever, a few cons to point out:

(skipping pros as I already stated it is one of my fav games)

1)  for most of the game, the levels are very...  ""samey"".  You almost wonder if it's a game engine limitation, as it takes almost the entire game before you reach a spot with a color besides black, white, or a shade between.  This includes the NPCs, not just the levels!  You could play the game on a black & white tv and the game would look the same for about 90% of it.

2)  The AI.  People praise it.  And more importantly, nine years ago the AI was used as a selling point by the devs.  There was supposed to be something bold about it.  The truth?  When you are done with the game, watch a speedrun of the game.  ""Yeah, that was on 'easy', though"".  No, no.  Find the speedrun on the hardest difficulty.  Yeah, that's right, the AI is the same.

This game is a blast to speedrun in as the AI is nearly non-existent.  You can just run past almost every bad guy.

3)  con, or maybe pro?  The original F.E.A.R. basically has no boss battles.  And this actually works very well IMO, but people might not like it.  Apparently the devs didn't like it, as all of the other sequels and DLC expansions have boss battles.

4)  The original game focuses on story.  All other expansions and sequels focus on action.  For this reason, you might bore of the expansions, especially PM.  On the other hand, for this reason you might bore of the original game.  If action is your thing, then fortunately only the original game might bore you.

5)  Also, the XP and PM expansions are not even canon to the sequels.  People might want to be aware of this going in.

Due to this, I actually initially skipped PM on my first playthrough of the series.  But, after a few playthroughs of PM, I actually quite like it now, but only because it focuses on action and gameplay, not story.  

Ironic that only PM actually has some challenging AI, yet it is rated the worst in the entire series.

And lastly...

6)  The ""gimmick"" in this game is basically a cheat.  It helps the game to focus on the story, but the action becomes even less challenging thanks to it."
76561197961262628,1419272480,True,A classic first person horror action game. One of my personal favorites.
76561197970625484,1419176352,True,"This game has all the elements of a great FPS: slow-mo, ghosts, a shotgun that turns bad guys into a pink mist, compliance posters... everything!"

76561198028112295,1418858888,True,"My standard tactic for FPS games is to get the enemies attention, duck behind a corner and wait for them to run out in front of me. I tried this. I activated slow motion, emptied a few rounds into a group of three and waited behind the entrance to the room. And I waited some more. First, I heard, ""Grenade out!"" and saw a frag bounce through the doorway and land in front of me. I ran backwards and managed to avoid it. Unfortunately for me, there was an upper floor that had stairs leading right behind me. Lo and behold, after being forced to expose myself with a grenade I was flanked and killed by someone coming all the way across the top floor and down the stairs.

I love this game."
76561198026677199,1418779623,True,"I find it difficult to believe that this game was made over 9 years ago! 

Many games today might have more bells and whistles and current day graphics but are not as fun to play.Though as you can see from the screenshots the graphics were advanced for it's day and still hold up well.

Be carefull of the enemy AI. They will flank you and kick your ass.

The story in this game is very interesting with at least 2 enemy factions competing to kill you.

The path you take through the game is linear but in a good way with minor puzzles to solve best way around obstacles and locked doors.

What I found surprising was how large the expansions are. I had played the base game previously and replayed it along with the other two this time around. The expansions in the good old days were as big as the base game itself. Not like DLC's these days that give you a new camo and a couple of different guns.

Play this game at night when all is quiet with the lights off."

PS. ladders are scary... :)"
76561197993924949,1418684066,True,Fantastic shooter that has aged pretty well.
76561198037721844,1418627194,True,"Despite the not-so-subtle acronym, F.E.A.R is actually a fairly strong title. As a Horror-style game from 2005, is it worth playing?

As a game from 2005, it may be a little dated for modern gamers. Yet, despite being old, it isn't unbearable, and sometimes it's outright good. Dynamic lighting is something even modern games lack, yet FEAR manages to make a lot of atmospheric design choices that make you overlook the actual quality of the graphics. The level design, use of shadows, and the sound all make up for a dated look.

Speaking of sound, the audio in this game is often fantastic. Bullets rip through the air, footsteps can reveal enemy positions, and the 'horror' moments of the game are made all the more tense because of the audio.

Does it work as a horror game?

Unlike a game such as Amnesia, FEAR is a horror game where you are armed and capable of defeating potential menaces, which reduces the amount of raw tension usually present in horror titles. In fact, it would be more accurate to say that it is an FPS game with horror elements, much akin to Dead Space. If you enjoyed Dead Space, FEAR is very similar, with slightly less emphasis on Sci-Fi and a little more on the modern paranormal. FEAR also crosses territories with Half-Life in terms of look, feel, and storytelling; combat is often done in narrow halls, yet they are not so constricted that something cannot sneak up behind you, or that there isn't a different angle to attack from.

The game's difficulty is also somewhat irregular, though not necessarily in a bad way. At normal difficulties, enemies are easy to rip through, but can return the pain quite well. A bad grenade, a turn taken too fast, or being snuck up on can leave a player with a third of their health gone in an instant - and that's on the normal difficulty. However, smart use of the character's ""Slo-mo"" power, attentiveness to surroundings, and smart use of the game's more powerful weapons (proximity grenades are excellent for covering your back and alerting you to a flank) will make the game seem easy to the point where the player will not take damage for long periods of time. Since difficulty can be changed in-game, you are free to set it to hard (or very-hard), but normal will be enough for most players.

Are there jump scares? Yes, and they will shock you into wasting your ammo, I guarantee it. However, with only one or two exceptions, most of them are harmless to the protagonist; trying to predict them just makes you more tense. Both the severity and frequency of cheap scares go down near the mid-game though, allowing players to focus on the action and the brief bits of story (though I have to admit, some of those scares were fun in retrospect).

If you want a more modern, darker Half-Life 1 and you enjoyed the kind of tension Dead Space offered, FEAR is probably right up your alley.

Ah! One more thing; there is an FPS issue for those using Logitech mice/keyboards. Go to your Device Manager and switch off anything labeled ""HID-Compliant Device."" Don't touch anything that doesn't say exactly that. There should be guides to help you if that's not enough. But yes, if you're wondering why your shiny new computer isn't giving you crisp FPS on a game from 2005, that's why."

76561197992393910,1418422392,True,Great FPS. After many years I like to get back to it. It never get's old.
76561198038604011,1418331042,True,"Shockingly fantastic. I installed it just looking for sort of a janky aging shooter to mindlessly walk through but from the very first level F.E.A.R. blew my mind.

I think this game single handedly caused my mind to divide the term FPS from Modern Military Shooter. I don’t know that I have the insight, experience or the articulation to explain it, but these older games really are different than modern shooters. And in my opinion, it was for the better. One of the very first things I noticed was how spectacular the texture work was in FEAR; some of the objects even trumped objects I’ve seen in recent AAA releases. The lighting also must have been something to behold when it first released. All the light sources in FEAR are dynamic and interact with the environment and with your character, casting shadows which enemy AI are amazingly aware of. The first time I heard a guy say “Hey! I think I saw a shadow over there!” while I was walking past a lamp in the next room, my mind literally shut down in disbelief. I actually have to play FEAR the way that I pretend I have to play MMS games and it is everything I’ve been looking for in a FPS game.

I’ve always told people I don’t like shooters. What I’ve actually meant is that I don’t like modern military shooters. FEAR has shown me that I really do love FPS, it’s just that no one does it right nowadays."
76561198117720401,1418318660,True,"They don't call it F.E.A.R. For nothing.

(If you're too lazy to read this review, just buy the game).

FEAR is a first-person shooter game that swaps between throwing baddies with guns at you, to throwing a scary little girl and some really frightening hallucinations at you. This game made me deathly afraid of ladders for the entire playthrough, from just one hallucination early on.

Basically, the story is a little goofy and feels goofier when all the characters take it so seriously, but you are a member of the ""First Encounter Assault Recon"" task squad (nevermind that Assault and Recon are two entirely different things) and are assigned with bringing down a man named Paxton Fettel, who is a psychic commander to a secret clone army (I said it was goofy) and out of nowhere an evil little girl ghostie-goo is haunting you and killing people. Despite it's goofiness, the story gets better as it goes, and ends up becoming really awesome.

The gameplay is broken into segments of exploration and light puzzle solving, to crazy fun combat, and getting the poop scared out of you by the mysterious ghostie girl. The exploration and puzzles aren't really anything new, if you've played Half-Life 2 it's like that, but with none of those dumb see-saw puzzles. The scary moments are, well, scary and well done, however they begin to get a little predictable near the end of the game, but for the first 70% of the game people will disintegrate around you, you'll be teleported to different locations, and the little girl will try to kill you, and you'll be scared. Not horrified, but scared and probably asking, ""What the #@^%$?,"" multiplie times. Where the game truly shines though is in it's combat. The combat is fast paced and brutal, and bullets tear chunks out of walls and objects and spray particles into the air. A simple office shootout becomes mayhem as dust fills the air as shrapnel flies off walls, computers explode in bright flashes of light, and paper flutters around the air as enemies hunt for any sign of you, whether it's your flashlight or a sound you make in game. And these enemies are smart, they have the best AI I've seen in a game. They constantly hunt you down, flanking and calling orders to each other, quickly detecting you if you get to close  to their field of vision, spot your flashlight, call for reinforcements. This makes it feel like you're fighting a true army of highly trained soldiers and makes the combat shine, as each individual fight will play out completely different ways each time you play. You also have a bullet-time feature which you can trigger whenever you'd like, and it turns any combat situation into the lobby scene from The Matrix. Bullets cut through the air, leaving little ripples behind them, dust slowly explodes from damaged walls as you and your enemies shoot and jump kick each other to death in slow-motion. It's incredibly fun, and gives you the killers edge you need against the intelligent AI, and also ties into the story nicely.

The game was a real blast to play through, and when things become a little too boring it introduces new things, such as hallucinations that will try and kill you, or invisible, wall climbing ninjas that will make you jump and scream and spray your bullets wildly. When these newer features get old (the ninjas never do, there were too few of them actually), the game gives you one of the best video game finales you will ever see.

I rate this game a 5 for Amazeballs, it is the highest rating I can give, and it means you should buy it like right now. I'm waiting. No seriously, stop fooling around. Buy it."

Enimies will crawl under obsticles, flank you, and draw you out of cover with grenades into waiting soldiers. What Im most impressed by is the soldiers ability to utilize cover. Not only do they hide behind existing cover, but they will activly make their own. Unlike other FPS' FEAR has some really cool unique guns, like my favorite, an assault rife that shoots foot long spikes that can pin people to walls. Its not as creative as games such as URT or more recently Sunset Overdrive, but its still refreshing to not use the same kind of guns over and over again like in CoD (Up until CoD AW).

The game is creepy, but not scary. The games biggest flaw is its inability to do combat and scares at the same time which really keeps the suspense down at times. If your in combat you know you are free of scares. The story is great, but I just wish that the game could pull off the horror aspect better. It is much improved in FEAR 2, Overall I love this game. Its starting to show its age graphically, but its gameplay is still awesome and worth replaying from time to time like I have."

76561198046134748,1416811281,True,"F.E.A.R. has plenty of flaws. The levels in the first half are samey, featuring dull and bland-looking industrial environments that aren't helped by its aged graphics. Mission objectives are uninspired. The scares wear off quickly, especially when they happen while you're looking in the wrong direction. Story is meh. Frankly, the only positive thing about the game is the combat, and the combat alone is what makes this game a classic. Bloody combat, vicious weapons, impressive enemy AI and cool visual effects make each battle an event to look forward to. Include the slow-mo ability and the battles become a thing of beauty: Grenade distortions rippling through the air, the vicious ""thump, thump, thump"" of your assault rifle, enemies dying in glorious sprays of blood, seeing a Replica sailing stylishly through the air after receiving a flying kick...
In short, F.E.A.R. has some of the most impressive FPS combat ever, and you should definitely experience it."

76561198032223546,1416721065,True,"F.E.A.R. slow-mo'd its way onto my list of top FPS games, competing with Battlefront 2, Halo 2, Far Cry 3, and Republic Commando. 

F.E.A.R. beautifully manages the thin red line between horror and first person shooting with atmospheric yet intense gunplay. Your opponents, the Replicant soldiers created by Armachan and the Armachan private army both have excellent AI. They behave very intelligently under the circumstances and coordinate well as squads. 

The storyline engrossed me completely even though it wasn't deep. It was disturbing, dark, and thrilling as you put together the picture. Overall the game feels satisfying. There's nothing quite as satisfying as ambushing an enemy squad then while in slow-motion wipe them all out in less then a second (in game time).

Most surprisingly the graphics hold up better than its sequel, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. Now nearly 10 years after its original release F.E.A.R.'s graphics are visually interesting and highly functional. The enemy units come in variety and all are fascinating to look at. The sequel's graphics while most advanced are simply dull and remind one of Call of Duty.

Ultimately, I recommend this to any member of the gaming community to play. Be wary of the sequels, they are unimpressive but fun at best. They're downright terrible if you want more of the original flavor."
76561198149477138,1416699502,True,"If you're looking for cheap jump scares, FEAR is not the game for you.  Throughout the game, I can safely say I only jumped once or twice.  Where FEAR really delivers, however, is its tense atmosphere that keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout most of the game.  The dripping of blood and the unnaturally loud noise of knocking something over makes you want to slow down and peek around the corner to make sure Alma isn't waiting.  Which she often is.  The enemies are pretty repetitive, and there are only about five or six variations throughout the story.  The reflex ability partially alleviates this, making the fights far more interesting.  The low price makes it a great deal, especially if you can find it discounted."

[u] It's an FPS and that's about it. [/u]

So i finally bought F.E.A.R during the Halloween sales period and after playing through it (and its two (2) expansion packs), i cannot remember much from it...

I know that sounds bad and i'm man enough to admit my unprofessional tendencies, but most of my memory loss is credited to that F.E.A.R and its expansions are extremely similiar.

I'm not going to reference the story that much, although i listened to it very closely and it was at least interesting. It had the issue for it being in an FPS game, which unless you are in an character-rpg is a tad silly.

The story goes... Oh damn, it's a bit hard to explain. Something about breeding supersoldiers, goverment programs, creepy skinny motherf*cker [spoiler] (Who i heard in the later games has that very agenda in mind..) [/spoiler]  and a creepy little girl in a red dress. Oh and something, else, that is, extremely relevant..

Honestly guys, the story is good, i'l give it that. The problem is, as said, it is in an FPS-Game and that is my main issue with it.

The game plays like your standart, sort-of-tactical-not-really-cover-based-style shooter, with a bullet-time mechanic that is a wee-bit overpowered. Honestly, most of my playthrough i had a shotgun and i was spamming headshots with it every time i had enough bullet-time charge.. I should disclose i played the game on normal, not hard, maybe i should go and play it again someday, but right now i can't be bothered.

But for some reason i cannot give the game a negative review, i don't know why.. Maybe, even with it's shortcomings the game was very enjoyable. Some of the little scaredy-moments were good enough to cause me to bang my knee to the bottom of the desk, but because it happened only a few times in the whole game. I cannot really base that as worth of a dislike.

The shooting (even with being a bit easy to exploit) was in total, rather good. There were only few instances where i was forced to take a more tactical aproach, picking off certain enemies before taking on the other. Oh and the shotgun is a must, because it is a right beast..

Now, the one thing that kills the games mood. Is the somewhat awkward little segments where i felt the pacing could have been better. I felt this a few times during the expansions as well.. I cannot really place it, but i remember noticing it several times.


To summarize this rather tired, not realy on the point review:

+ Good shooting.
+ Mostly consistent atmosphere.
+ Graphics hold up rather nicely.

- Awkward little segments.
- Mostly consistent atmosphere.
- Few annoying fights."
76561198044825285,1415925058,True,"A must buy, although finished in about 10 hours, the shooting is very satisfying.

Definitly buy with the expansions and other games when on sale."
76561197960474426,1415857027,True,"Its been so long since I played the original Fear. I remember when it first came out I was scared to run all the time.

F.E.A.R became one of my favorite FPS after the spooks scared me to death (Okay, this is exaggerating :P)

F.E.A.R is a good horror games infused with decent FPS gameplay, 

The graphic is some sort of okay since this is not a brand new game using sophisticated engines, but what's more important is the ""Fear"" and ""Thrill"" you got from the game, instead of just watching out for enemies, this time get ready for jumpscares too.

Overall it's excellent 8.5/10

The story is well written, the combat mechanics are smooth, and the unexpected horror scenes are creepy enough to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout your playthrough.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys first-person shooters and horror, as long as they can handle dated graphics."

-Battles are REALLY fun in this game, this is the reason why I still play this game, the combat is so just so satifying
-Slow motion (aka bullet time), it never gets old using the nail gun to pin some one to the wall in slow mo

Cons

-FEAR Combat/multiplayer death match is now pretty dead, only players left are pros so you have no chance. Back in the day the cheaters where out of control too"

The graphics are dated, to be sure, but they certainly aren't bad, and didn't distract from the gameplay.

The A.I made my mind figuratively explode.  It is better than any game I've experienced recently, and really makes popular games stand out as examples of how essential gameplay elements are discarded in favor of prettier pictures.  Take a good look at F.E.A.R, Bioshock Infinite, and then hang your head in shame.

The other aspect of this game that stands out is the atmosphere.  The game is not outright scary, and that's a good thing.  It doesn't reply on cheap jump scares, but rather doles out intermittent scenes of gore and supernatural phenomenon, then forces you continue forward despite your inclination toward retreat.  It's like you want to run out front door, but you have to run upstairs, even though you know that is a terrible idea."

76561198026973737,1415310679,True,The best part of this game obviously has to be the slow-motion feature. It really makes you feel like a supernatural killer and it makes the game more intense.

76561197974634162,1414699159,True,"Although it's a bit dated graphically, this is really an excellent horror FPS.  The weapons and gunplay in general are satisfying, and  enemy AI is quite good--far better in fact than what we've grown used to in SP FPSs, and it has an engrossing and haunting story that gradually reveals itself as the game progresses.  Levels do get a bit repetitive, though, which may hurt replayability.

It does have some cheesy jump scares at times, but the overall atmosphere is very tense and creepy, in no small part due to the surprisingly restrained but genuinely unnerving sightings of Alma, the psychic spectres of her former victims, vivid and disturbing hallucinations that the player experiences, and the poorly lit environs crawling with mercs and other, less human monsters that most of the game plays out in.

You'll definitely want to explore at least a bit, though, as a fair amount of narrative context is conveyed through voicemails, laptops, and overheard conversations that you'd miss if you're speed-running through the levels.  The plot, while good by FPS standards, is still incomplete and requires the completion of FEAR2 and FEAR3 to fully comprehend, which is disappointing since both of those games (story-wise) don't measure up to the original by a long shot.  

If you like atmospheric, story-driven horror FPS with smart AI, look no further.  This is a new classic for good reason.

Oh, and the ending--so perfect."

76561198094651178,1414375319,True,"F.E.A.R. ~ An almost forgotten relic from 2005. 

If you managed to find this game because of curiosity, a recommendation from a friend, you're an old FPS die hard fan, or some other reason, this game may leave you satisfied. 

The major strengths of F.E.A.R. consist of a suitable soundtrack in which the music matches with its appropriate scene. If you are isolated and cannot predict what is around a corner, there will be suspenseful music. Otherwise, a fierce firefight will make your blood pump faster and the music won't disappoint.  

The A.I. for the enemies, specifically the Replica forces, will not bore you. They are unpredicatable and vicious for they only serve to complete the main antagonist of the game. In other words, the movement of the Replicas are well coordinated and they tend to flank. In harder difficulties, their attacks are more devastating thus forcing you to avoid confronting more than a couple of these soldiers. Each Replica unit is unique and I find most of their voices, interactions with their squad and the given environment, and the way they assess threats very realistic. 

There are a ton of weapons , ranging from the usualy pistol and shotgun, to a futuristic particle weapon that can sear the flesh off a living being. 

Thanks to ""Slow-mo', the one ability in this game that makes a difference, F.E.A.R. allows you to see your inflicted destruction on targets in a ""beautiful"" way. This is what gives you the ultimate power over your enemies. 

Although I do like this game, its existence is not without cons unfortunately. F.E.A.R. was heavily focused on action and left other parts of the game underdevelopd. 

The plot is scarcely detailed and relies too much on listening to mundane laptops , voice mails, and some news reports. These are easily skipped and it's a waste of time to listen to them. 

Overall, most of the characters are forgettable and they don't have that much interaction with each other.  

Some of the transitions between suspense, horror, and action seem quite ""choppy"". In greater detail, if you leave an area after a fight, you're almost immediately pulled into a terrifying scene. This will make a lot of players more confused than scared. 

As for the expansion packs, they are acceptable to play. Be warned though, that Extraction Point is more horror oriented, has more jumpscares, and the plot is even thinner. After playing it for a while, you will lose your interest if you favor action. On the other hand, Perseus Mandate seems like a ripoff of F.E.A.R. and its aforementioned expansion pack. There may be some new enemies, weapons, and 3 ""bonus missions"" that can test your skill but this game will leave you more upset if you're a loyal fan. In my case, the most hated part of the game for me was the music. It was good but it's not sutiable for a F.E.A.R. game! 

Despite the criticism, I do recommend F.E.A.R. if you like to possess ""slow-mo"" and mow down enemies with any newly obtained gun. So far, the action is what keeps me playing F.E.A.R. every once in a while."

The thing is, the horror in this game is mostly just creepy; I remember ONE memorable scare (on a ladder) but everything else was just... eh. The ""scary parts"" are preceded by sound effects that aren't sudden but ease in, making it not scary. Many times I would hear this creepy sound coming in, then look around for something scary and see a figure walking around a wall. Oooh. 

As a shooter, I like the way the guns work and the bullet-time reflex slomo stuff is fun to play around with. As a story, I thought it was interesting but not compelling. As for gameplay in general, there is a lot of backtracking and it can be frustrating walking around looking for the exit to the next section. The enemies are boring with the occasional ""boss"" every once in a while. No monsters or scary things to shoot at here - just soldiers. Lots and lots of soldiers. 

The game took me about me about 8 hours to finish on normal difficulty. Overall, if you're looking for a shooter you can play when you want to shoot stuff, this game is pretty fun. The slomo fighting is probably the best part of the game. If you're looking for a horror game, don't bother with this one. It isn't scary and doesn't really have a lot of horror actually in it. There's a bunch of blood and skeletons but nothing actually horrifying. 

Gameplay: 7/10
Horror: 4/10
Story: Didn't really pay attention. I was too busy waiting for scares, lol. Pretty predictable, 5/10 maybe."
76561198096883192,1414342527,True,"F.E.A.R. is an interesting game with heavy inspiration from horror movies like ""The Ring"" (Haven't you noticed that the scary girl from The Ring looks and acts almost identical to Alma?) And succeeds in almost everything it sets out to do. The gameplay is solid, the music is good, the graphics are very impresive at the time it was released, the level design is great, and the enemy AI is still superior to most games today. Not to mention the awesome weapons that you can find (The minigun is my faverite!).

Now for the parts of the game which aren't so good, the story in F.E.A.R. 1 was servicable, but in Extraction Point and Persus Mandate I didn't feel as though anything important happened. What dissapoints me the most however is the horror aspect of the game: F.E.A.R. isn't scary, it just isn't. There is never a moment in the game where you feel vunerable because of all of this elite weaponary you have on top of the slow-mo. It's really hard to genuinly scare someone after they just single-handedly destroyed two mechs with a rocket launcher. That isn't to say that the game doesn't have it's scary moments, but those scary moments only take up about 25% of the game.

Overall F.E.A.R. is a very good game, and and I did have fun blasting someone in the face with a shotgun in slow-motion. But if you want to play a game just for the horror aspect, you might want to pass on this one."
76561198006230589,1414317739,True,"The game that embodies perfectly slow motion with shooting with horror elements. One of the most underrated games of its generation, a real must play"
76561198030564061,1414298929,True,"To be completely honest, it's weird for a game like this to actually be pretty scary. When you think about it, there are no real horror like enemies in the game. No weird monsters or mutated freaks. Just Replica Soldiers. But god the atmosphere in this game, along with the audio can be so thick that you can cut it with a knife. The environments are dark and sometimes in states of complete ruin. The noises you hear are just terrifying, and ugh, don't get me started on the late game stuff.

You can sorta put this game into two parts.

The first is the action part. Where you're shooting enemies and trying to stay alive. Whilst it's mostly standard shooting stuff, you have a feature called Reflex, witch pretty much acts like bullet time from Max Payne. And like Max Payne, it helps to elevate this game, and even the odds against your enemies. Plus they actually give you a story reason for having it!

The second part is exploration. This is where the game gets scary. When the music and ambiance ramp up, and that little comm symbol in the corner displays a flickering ""Unknown signal"". You know that you're in for some freaky stuff. This is where the FEAR shines. I was legit hesitant to move on because of how much I was scared and worried about what was to happen. Even if I knew that I was in no danger.

Now I mentioned that there are no ""Monster"" type enemies in the game, but that's kind of a lie. In certain segments, and parts near the end, you fight aparition like monsters. But like I said, they're kept for very specific parts and for a short while.

If the main game wasn't enough, however, it also comes with the two expansion packs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, for absolutely free, adding another 5 hours each to an already 8 hour game. 

Extraction point is a direct (But non canon) sequel to the first game, taking place where it left off. Due to events at the end of the first game, the area you were in has been devestated, and the supernatural anomolies which were mostly contained are running in full force. 

This expansion I would almost say is even scarier than the main game, mostly for the fact that, like mentioned, the supernatural is now in full force. You'll be fighting some more creepier enemies, and going through a lot more scary shit than the main game. Along with the newly added weapons, this is the best out of the two expansions.

The main problem with the second, Perseus Mandate, is that it feel like more of the same. Non of the new weapons from Extraction point appear, and the only thing they add are a new enemy or two. It's still creepy, and still fun, but not as good as the other two parts. I'd suggest playing this one first if not for story reasons.

But overal, F.E.A.R is more than worth getting. The online feature doesn't work anymore but, it is still a great, and horrifying single player experience."
76561198055293226,1414269969,True,"Very good balance between action and horror gameplay, this is the kind of game that will not cause you to jump out of your skin scared from an in-your-face scare (there are a few moments though) but the atmosphere and cut scenes will surround you pretty tightly.  

Both datadisks are also good, however there is not much inovation and the story line also kind of degrades, as does the good balanced atmosphere from the original title."
76561197969484381,1414241934,True,"With most horror games, they blow their load early and show you the scariest stuff in the first ten minutes. Over the course of the game, the player becomes desensitized to it, having to repeatedly encounter zombies and monsters across the span of 7-10 hours.

F.E.A.R. on the other hand is a game of build-up. It doesn’t start out especially scary, but as I kept playing it, it very gradually started to creep me out. I would hesitate to say that it outright scared me, because it takes a lot for a game to legitimately scare me. But as you creep around its desolate office complex, an unsettling feeling begins to seep in to your brain. It’s like being in a supermarket after hours - a place so obviously bustling with people and noise and life, now empty. You can’t shake the feeling that something’s wrong and you really, really shouldn’t be here. Everything’s too quiet and you feel a little vulnerable.

Eventually the tension mounts and the creepy atmosphere pays off. The end of the game could’ve had a bigger finale with some sort of climactic boss encounter, but ultimately it doesn’t need one. The ending is unforgettable even without a big scary monster to kill - and maybe that’s for the best. I’d complain that F.E.A.R. ends on something of a cliffhanger, but all the best horror movies do, and so too does F.E.A.R."

You had all this hype about the new consoles coming out and the amazing graphics they would deliver and sure the Xbox 360 went ahead and became quite the success story in the long run. But you know what else came out in 2005 and was better then anything on said new console hardware? F.E.A.R did. This game has fantastic visuals that still hold up today in some regards (absolutely amazing particle effects). The gunplay is still the best in the business. No other game has come close to viceral fun of blasting away at a squad of replicas and seeing all the dust, sparks and shell casings filling the air around you in slo-mo. It also has great atmosphere and an interesting story. If you, for some reason, haven't played this gem yet: DO IT NOW. Go to the store page and buy it. You get both F.E.A.R and its 2 expansion packs (which are also pretty good) for 9 eurobucks."

Yeah had chills and then saw this guy on youtube named Steve and he played this game in the dark alone in his room recording himself of his reactions (first time playing it). Wow lol that was funny as heck and this is was back in 2005-2006. Good ol' days.......Yeah this game is great but when you look at it now the visual quality isn't great, too grainy pixels (well duh compared to now).  the part near the top floor and those monsters that goes in the ceiling office tops, scared the shit out of me and Alma appearing out of nowhere (usually behind you all the time, it only spawns in your field of view for game script).

Yeah old game classic, you'll get a kick out of it....."
76561198090710667,1414109364,True,A good FPS that has a slight HORROR feel to it.  This is a classic and it still has something that other games can't touch.  I would say this game is worth buying on sale for anyone who likes FPS.

It is a fantastic game! The graphics are still pretty good compared to the games that get released now, and the gameplay is really fun and overall immersive.
F.E.A.R. is a game where you're an operative with F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assult Recon) and you're trying to kill Paxton Fettel. Whilst doing that, you uncover political and buisness cover-ups. People don't like you for digging into that while still going after Fettel, and Fettel has is own ""army"" that is also trying to kill you. So lotta shooty-shooty-gun gameplay mixed with a few good scares.
If you want to play F.E.A.R. 2 or 3, you HAVE to play this first! Personally, it is my favorite and scariest one, plus its essential for the story."

76561197971791880,1413836786,True,"Traditional Rating: 7/10

Overall, this is an average game, and would rate only 5/10, but the slow-motion feature and the good horror storyline gives it a 7/10.  The atmosphere is creepy, and I often let loose a burst at a shadow or some bit of dungeon dressing.

I suggest waiting until it is on sale, since I'm an average player and still completed it in less than 20 hours.

What drove the rating down were several issues:
[list]
    [*]The game is very linear, with only a couple of places where you can solve problems in alternate ways, or where you have multiple paths to choose from.  Regardless of this, you still always have to end up at the same place for the storyline.
    [*]Except for the path for the story, you can't interact with anything...all other doors are painted on, and you can't open lockers, cabinets, etc.
    [*]The designers couldn't seem to figure out how to make certain sections hard enough, so they use the old ""take away all weapons"" trick.
    [*]Although there are many times when you are told you need to ""hurry"", you can take as long as you want, because everything is scripted based on triggers, so regardless of when you get someplace, you're either just a moment too late or just in time.
    [*]In the same way, triggers cause enemies to spawn.  This often leads to you running into bad guys in places you had cleared, with no way in except through you.  Also, some of the triggers are can be avoided, but none seem to effect completion of the game.
    [*]Although the ""only carry 3 weapons"" could have made this a really tough game by having to decide what to carry, the reality is that decent amounts of ammo are available for only 4 weapons after the first few levels, and two of the four are machine-gun variants, with one clearly the superior.
    [*]Enemies can modify the environment (e.g., push over objects to use as cover) and maneuver better (dive and roll, crawl, etc.) than the player.  They also seem to be able to destroy more of the environment than you can, even if some of that is scripted.
[/list]"
76561198048974498,1413818644,True,"My first experience of this game was on the PlayStation 3, and I must say it still stands up as a rather unique and off-beat experience (even more so than its two also-excellent sequels). 

   On paper, I'm sure none of this would've made much sense: let's make a high-octane action game/first-person shooter, keep it MOSTLY straight, but with a constant HINT of something altogether spookier going on; with only the occasional foray into full-blown ""horror"".  And still somehow manage to be one of the tensest and spookiest games ever made.  

   Loonie tunes, right?  Except that they PULLED IT OFF.  
 
   It's hard to say how or why, but for some odd reason this game FEELS like a horror game almost the entire time, despite the fact that you spend most of that time running about maps shooting, well...dudes.  ""Super-soldiers"" they may be, but they're still DUDES, when all is said and done.   

   Yet herein lies the game's genius, as you really just don't know WHEN the supernatural shenanigans are going to invade the otherwise relatively familiar - if admittedly still atmospheric - ""action"" trappings, and temporarily turn the game into a different proposition altogether.  Then, just as suddenly as it came, the weirdness dissipates for a while again, and you can safely get back to shootin' bad guys (at least until the very, very end, where the horror perhaps predictably takes over more entirely).  

   What this all means is that the game is genuinely UNPREDICTABLE, and arguably all the more effective as a ""scary"" game than most other horror games...where you just KNOW there's gonna be some weird-arsed monster lurking around the next corner.  If you're still dubious as to how this could all possibly work...PLAY THE F*CKING THING.  
 
   Oh, and F.E.A.R. teaches you another valuable life lesson: DON'T TRUST FAT PEOPLE.  The NPC in question is at least twice as evil as the character played by that Newman actor in Jurassic Park.  NOTHING is what it seems in this game.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
 
Verdict: 10/10. 

(Oh, and PS: the ""slow-mo"" function of this game is simply AWESOME, and again, must be seen to be believed.)"
76561198032855698,1413663437,True,Parempi kun HL2.
76561198068913185,1413639836,True,"F.E.A.R. is a First Person Shooter Horror game.

You are the ""Point Man"" a person without any informations about, at least at the beginning.
You have a job, to catch a man called Paxton Fettel, a man that has more bounds with you than you might think at the beginning of the game. On your mission you often hear about a girl called Alma. Who is that? You even meet here several times in your paranormal visions. And the game is horror indeed. Often you are in levels where you are hunted by Fettels and Almas paranormal visions. Persons who die in front of you eyes and who die because of having their flesh removed from their bones. Thats totally normal. And that is not even all. You are always hunted by the dark... It can wait behind every corner. But who is Fettel and Alma actually? One thing is clear, you are bound with them but you cant tell how. That is your mission to find out.

The game has nice graphics especially for the fact its from 2005. I doubt that there was anything better looking back then, not even Far Cry from 2004 looked that great. If you ask me at least. Nearly everything is demolishable and the physics are great. What I really love is the bullet time that you can start anytime you want, but its limited and needs to recharge sometimes. You also have a flashlight but this one needs to recharge too. Dont waste your flashlight because you will need it. The play with the light and the dark is really amazing in this game.

I played the multiplayer once, it was ok and can make some fun.
BUT. The official multiplayer is done. There is F.E.A.R. Combat though, the multiplayer of F.E.A.R. that has been published by the community and is still supported. Works without problems. You should try it, its free. Just google for their website.

The Steam version also has both released addons for free!
Both are NOT considered canon by the official developers Monolith. Its fiction.
Means things that happened in them are not covered by FEAR 1, 2, 3.
Extraction Point tells the story what happened after the main game ending.
Its nice and it still had those Horror shocker. I really liked this addon.
Only downside is that for some reason its not supporting widescreen out of the box.
Weirdly the main game and Perseus Mandate does... However, you can easily edit a ini to get your desired widescreen resolutions, google it.
Perseus Mandate on the other hand wasnt really my taste.
You are a whole different character trying to uncover mission perseus.
The horror shockers in this addon are nearly non existent if you ask me.
Also its mostly about shooting yourself through corridors flooded with replicants.
I died very often because it was way too difficult, even on normal compared to the other games.
It was frustrating and a little bit boring, especially at the end.
Both addons were developed by another developer named Timegate Studios.

The maingame will take up to 10 hours to finish.
The addons each around 5 hours.

The Steam version comes only in English!
There are several language packs available as Steam guides and also in the web.
I also added a German UNCUT language pack for those who like to play the games in German.
Its in the guide section.

Also I want to say that F.E.A.R. and its addons suffer from FPS problems on most modern rigs.
This is due to the engine having problems with several HID devices like mouse, keyboard, controller.
All systems starting with Vista can have this problem. The fix is to disable several HID devices. Google it. This is actually really annoying. There are some more problems. EAX does not work on all modern systems starting with Vista. Some can still enable it with soundcard driver programs. Or use a tool called directsound to activate basic EAX support. I should note that Windows XP fixes actually both issues. Also the game itself is not able to activate soft shadows and anti aliasing at the same time. To do so you have to use Nvidia inspector and a online tutorial to add proper anti aliasing support. Just disable the ingame AA but leave soft shadows on. Works fine then. I dont know if there is a AMD way to do this.

Positive:
- Bullet time
- Good graphics (2005)
- Good Story
- Big amount of options ingame
- Alma is one of the best game characters ever
- No health regeneration!
- Great play with the dark and shadows
- Good and fitting unique soundtrack
- Good Enemy AI
- Shooting is a lot of fun

Neutral:
- Multiplayer is ok but dead, use community mod to fix it
- Not available in the German Steam store

Negative:
- High Difficulty
- Mostly simple and kinda boring level designs
- Technical problems with modern systems
- Some questionable key settings, changeable

Replayability: Medium

I really liked the story of it and the atmosphere, also the bullettime.
Alma was one of the creepiest and most interesting characters I have ever met in a videogame.
The addon Extraction Point was just as good as the main game. 
Perseus Mandate wasnt good though.
I would give 8.5/10 points for the maingame and the extraction point addon.
Perseus Mandate wont get more than 5/10.

The weapons are brutal and the enemies work together to try and anahilate you. The game is hard at times but never unfair, it makes sure to never baby you and let you work things out yourself. The greatest thing about this game is probably the enemies, they shout out commands to their squad and their squad will respond in turn. If you try to ambush them and one hears you knock something over he'll tell the others, if one goes silent they'll go into search mode, if one gets pinned down or sees you flanking he'll tell the others and they will react in turn. People who like dark themes bordering on paranormal, tactical fps games, blowing shit up, or enjoy a good (but not too intense) scare will usually love this game.

76561198037865938,1412633015,True,"F.E.A.R is... well, let's just say it's different. It's like most shooters (at least from its time), but not. It combines a creepy atmosphere and super intense action to create the experience. I guess it's really not fair to compare it to other shooters because it is not like other shooters in the sense that this one has a story. It's a weird story and sometimes off, but a story nontheless. The greatest thing about this game is the slo-mo feature. Yup, you can slow down time all Matrix like. And yes, before you decide to question it, it is amazing. The AI, while stupid in some parts, is actually quite good. they work together instead of running past the same corner ten of their buddies were shot next to. for example, if you are up against two enemies, one will stay back while the other slowly approaches you and flanks you. The one who stayed put, will use suppressing fire to distract you, giving the other guy a minute to smack you in the back of the head with his own bullet. They also really like to use grenades, and have a pretty good arm too, so watch out for that. Even though the game is over five years old now, it still looks pretty decent. the blood and gore effects are stil gruesome, and the vaporization effects Alma (antagonist) uses on some helpless people during cutscenes is impressive. It's always fun to watch someone's skin get burned away by an angry ghost child. That's another thing worth mentioning; the horror in the game is cut down to mostly just jump scares and long, dark hallways. nothing really else outside of that. The action, however, is intense. especially when you come across the mechs. Oh, did I not mention that before? Well, now I did. Yes, giant metal monsters will be trying to blow your insignificant human body up into millions of tiny, bloody pieces. Conclusion: should you but this? To put it simply, yes. Even without multiplayer, it is still a fresh change from the mundane of shooters we have been forced to suffer with in recent years."

I played the crap out of it too. At the time I had probably the worst set up ever for this game. The desktop was on the ground and my monitor was on top of it. I had to use what little space was left to place my mouse atop of the desktop and of course I had to set the keyboard on my lap (what better place?). And I had to sit in a miniature lawn chair that had the seat lifted from the ground about 6 entire inches. Not kidding folks. But would I change a single aspect of this memory? You better think again if you believe I would. This was the highlight of my gaming life. Especially for PC gaming. I enjoyed every single nanosecond!

Overall this game is incredible even all the way into 2014. As everyone has said, the AI is insanely well constructed. Hell it won the award for the best AI of the year for a reason. They work and attack similar to a real military combat unit. They even try to call out to their team and give info on what you are trying to do. The only part I didn't like was the end. The enemies you have to fight there are pathetic and just a plain bother. That would be the only thing I wish would be changed. This game is mind blowing and will always be held extremely high in my books until I die.

You won't make a mistake getting this game. That is a definite."

I just added FEAR in my steam library, altough i own the game since it's release. I completed the storyline (for the 10th, at least, time) and it's time for me to write a review.  To be honest, the only reason i started playing again, is that i am a nostalgic guy, and after so many years i wanted to play this game again. But now i think about it again, and i figure that this is the most irrelevant reason to play it  ;)

[u]Story(No Spoilers)[/u]
The protagonist is the ""Point Man"" (no real name) of F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon),a secret unit of the US Government, specializing in dealing with paranormal threats. The mission is to take down Paxton Fettel, and his clone army, known as Replica.

[u]Game Time[/u]
It takes about 8-10 hours to complete the campaign (depending on the difficulty)

[u]In detail[/u]
If you get this game, it wont be about the kickass graphics or its realistic gameplay, If you expect something like that, i bet you will be disappointed. However the atmospheric gameplay, created by the well-designed maps and the awesome light-shade effects, the enemy AI, which is far more advanced than even some today's FPS and the great storyline totally compensate the game's drawbacks.
Additionally, the multiplayer was awesome and made me spend many hours playing. When i found out that MP doesnt' work anymore i got sad. 

[u]Pros[/u]
+ Great graphics at the time of release
+ Atmospheric gameplay created by the lighting and shade effects, with the addition of even greater sound effets
+ Advanced enemy A.I. which can make the game challenging 
+ Interesting storyline and plot similar to an action-horror movie. The well created cutscenes add to that.
+ Variety of weapons and grenades

[u]Cons[/u]
- No multiplayer ( T.T )
- Some glitches may occur due to specific graphic combos.
- Usually repititive

Concluding, worth buying it since it's considered a classic!

76561197986383155,1412207649,True,"FEAR is a game that has been recommended to me time and time again by so many different people, and I've always been skeptical to try it simply because of the disturbing little girl on the cover known as ""Alma."" Now that I finally scrounged up the courage to sit through the entire game, I discovered that hidden behind the ""horror"" genre this game's title would imply, is a well rounded and excellent shooter game that reminds me of the good old days of PC gaming like Max Payne. So to anyone who's nervous to give this game a try, don't be! There are a few jump scares here and there, but the gameplay is just so much fun that it shouldn't really bother you. 

The gameplay is pretty solid in this game. You're given a gun, some health packs, and the ability to slow down time which never gets old. The level design is pretty stale which is pretty typical due to hardware limitations at the time, so the environments can be pretty repetitive. You'll fight in warehouses, a large office building, and then more warehouses throughout the course of the short 6 hours campaign. The pacing of the game itself is appropriate as enemies will become more numerous as you move room to room and will test your abilities more and more until they introduce a new enemy type. The variety in enemy types is pretty limited though. You'll fight standard guards, some slightly more heavilty armed guards, heavies, and eventually you'll go toe to toe with some big mech-based contraptions that will take a lot of firepower to take down. But never did I feel like the game was too hard. In fact, I blew threw the game without much difficulty at all (having set the difficulty only at ""normal""). FEAR also appears to be a shooter ahead of its time, with hidden voice recordings hidden throughout the world in the form of answering machines that help create a sense of immersion in the world. Overall, the gameplay is excellent but the level design and environment can feel pretty stale even with the inclusion of nice touches like radio broadcasts and answering machines. 

The story of the game takes a backseat to the gameplay, as it's incredibly simple and straight forward. You are a soldier part of a special team called ""F.E.A.R."" that is tasked with capturing some bio-terrorist that likes to eat people (something that I don't believe was ever explained). Your specific soldier appears to be special with enhanced reflexes (which explains your ability to slow down time at will during the gameplay), and you continuously throughout the duration of the game have visions of some horrible scene that presumably is from your dark secret past. In addition to these visions, you randomly see some little girl named ""Alma"" that only you and this bio-terrorist guy seem to even know about. All of which is explained towards the end. The ending is definitely a cliff-hanger, making room for the inevitable sequel that is ""FEAR 2: Project Origin."" So the story is interesting, it's not fantastic, but it's interesting enough for to me to be able to remember it so I guess that's something. 

The graphics are pretty damn impressive for 2006. There are dynamic lights setup in the environment that when shot will actually react realistically to the environment. There is some impressive physics work also that really shines when you're in a slow motion gunfight in a clustered room (like in the office building levels). TV's will shake on the wall, debris from the desks will fly everywhere, bullet casings will independently hit the ground randomly, and enemies and their body parts will rag doll all over the place. It's clear that the graphical limitations of the time limited the developers to some pretty boring environments, but they really made up for it with the fantastic physic effects. 

Overall, the game is a ton of fun and looks great especially considering when it was made available. The story is interesting and mostly explains what's going on, although it's not fantastic as there aren't really any memorable characters other than the creepy little girl that continuously haunts you throughout the game. It's definitely worth the playthrough and I'm looking forward to playing the rest of the series.

76561198089998509,1412145197,True,"Fast Review:

Pros
-Slow motion/run-and-gun gameplay 
-Enemies that are not braindead, and are very capable of fucking you up (though you will probably want to turn the difficulty up in order to get the best experience)
-Flashy effects and gunplay that makes a lot of the shit you do look badass
-Good creepy-atmosphere building 
-Excellent graphics, even for today (dated in some aspects, but overall very visually appealing)

Cons
-Story is executed rather poorly
-Good atmosphere almost ruined by rather cheap jump scares (not all jump scares are cheap, but the ones in this game are)

Fast-but-not-as-fast-sorta Review:

The game, despite its downfalls when it comes to its story, is one of the best first person shooters I have had the pleasure to play. It mixes that badass feeling you get when you play Max Payne or Total Overdose and slathers on a thick coat of tactical shooter. The horror is lacking, but the gunplay is good enough to where you can certainly overlook that. The story is intriguing enough to where the gameplay isn't the only thing that's keeping you going, but there was one element here that clearly outshines the other. It doesn't live up to it's name, but it doesn't really have to. It's just that badass. 
Oh, and the two expansions that come with it are great as well. Pretty much the same pros and cons with those. 
E A S I L Y worth the $10 USD that it costs, and even more worth it when on sale (it doesn't go on sale too often, but I managed to get this for around $2.50 at one point)"
76561197973895209,1412092419,True,"Even nowadays it's still terrifying, fluid and beautifully presented! It may not be up there with the modern AAA FPSs but it surely worths a try, especially if you've never played it before!! Keep in mind that back in 2005 THIS was the ultimate benchmark for powerful PCs!!!"
76561198008563010,1412043856,True,"F.E.A.R. is a pretty decent game, and one that I'm glad I played. It actually kinda reminds me of the original Half-Life a bit, just not quite as legendary as that game, 

There are problems with this game. For one, it is NOT a horror game at all - there's barely anything remotely scary about it. There's a few potential jump scares, but that's it. On the other hand, the game does do a great job of setting a dark atmosphere for the player; it's scary in the same way that Half-Life was scary.

It's also a bit repetitve - sometimes I swore I had already been through certain places more than once. This is a fairly long game these days as well, at about 10 hours to complete, so this problem can be really annoying, depending on your tolerance level. 

Another MAJOR thing you should be aware of if you think about buying this game: Logitech products cause it to massively drop frame rate for no reason sometimes. This is a well-documented issue, and it does have fixes; however, with my setup, the only thing that worked was to play for about 20 minutes before the frame rate really began to degrade, then unplug the mouse and plug it back in. Only took a second to do it each time, but was mildly annoying to have to put up with.

Overall I would recommend it - just don't expect horror from this one. Expect a shooter."
76561198086364942,1412043789,True,"A 12 hours-game with no replayability. The shooting part is amazing, though.
The horror part? Not so much when you got bazooka, grenade launcher and plasma cannon."

76561198013322959,1412022141,True,"This is THE game I started swearing moving lamps, jumping boxes and little girl appearing in very disturbing ways. Still my favorite FPS/horror."
76561198002593367,1411994450,True,"This is a good cinematic FPS! Easily one of the better games I have played! My only real regret is that it took me this long to pick it up and begin playing it!

The game is also LONG! Which is a huge plus in my book, and should be in yours too. You definitely get your moneys worth with this purchase. So, unless you are someone who doesn't have much time to invest into a game, and just want a quick bang-bang, pew-pew experience, then get this now, otherwise stick with the single player CoD campaigns for your pew-pew thrills. This one will take several hours unless you just rush through without exploring. I am already 6+ hrs into the game, and I think I am only about halfway through the main campaign, then I still have the 2 included expansion packs to begin!

The game is also challenging, so if you want a game that's a breeze and practically plays it's self, then again! This might not be for you, but if you want a challenge then this game should be in your library.

Now, the game lists it's self as a horror game, and I just do not agree with that assesment. Sure there are a few ""gasp moments"", but only because the game relies on jump scare tactics, and I don't conisider loud noises or quick rushing objects appearing out of nowhere to be horror. To be fair, I believe jump scare tactics might be the only way to cause a fright in a FPS, as real horror comes from escaping and fearing for your life, not gunning down everything in your way in a hail of gunfire.

So, while I don't consider it a ""Horror"" game, I do consider it an excellent FPS that should be in everyones library!

76561197991103051,1411967257,False,"I cant force myself to finish the last few hours of this game. I have no idea how this got any kind of critical success.

Lets start with the port. One of the most bug ridden ports I have seen. A known bug with logitech devices prevents the game from even being playable unless you disable functions of your logitech devices while you play. 

Quite a few video and audio bugs. 

There is mouse support in menus thanks god, but many options lack a drop down menu which will require you to suffle through all the options to get the ones you want.

Now for the game itself.

This is not a horror game. The attempts at scares in this game are downright laughable. If you buy this game to have a horror expirence you will be very dissapointed.

It is to easy! The AI is just brian dead and it throws ammo, health, and armor at you in spades. Never did I drop below the allowed amount of 10 health packs on hand.

The enemy variety is so low. You fight the same guy 90% of the game who gets a slight re-skin occasionally.

The level design is just awful. To many times did I have to figure out where the hell I was supposed to be going because the office that 50% of the game takes place in, was designed by fucking Daedalus (google him). Usually I give structures in games some leeway because some sacrifices have to be made to make it interesting to play in. However, the buildings in this game are to far out there to believe could actually exsist. 

The guns are boring. You get a choice of 4 main guns (basically 3 machine guns and a pistol), a plasma gun that you get maybe 20 rounds for the entire game, or a rocket launcher which you also get no ammo for.

The story has some intrest to it but I dont feel its good enough to wade through this game to find out what happens. Whats worse is this is supposed to be the best in the series. Im not sure if I will be giving the other 2 games shot but since I already have them I might as well. Hopefully they will prove to be a better expirence than this thing."

While it does have a bit of the usual blood and gore that tends to perpetuate the horror genere today this is not the focus. It mainly focuses on the creepy atmosphere and jump scare qualites that founded the genere.

Combine that with an amazingly gripping story, expanded on with the 2 included DLC campaigns, and an uncomplicated combat system that even the most novice of gamers can handle and you have one great game.

Plus the easter egg that lets you kill that asshole Mapes...literally more fulfilling than killing Udina in ME3. If you don't know the joy of killing him after all the crap he pulls you haven't truly lived.

The first DLC - Extraction Point - picks off exactly where F.E.A.R. ended. Although it adds little to the story, there is plenty of close-quarters combat and it takes a decent amount of time to complete.

Perseus Mandate shows the story from another perspective and provides much more story than I expected. Taking a good amount of time to complete, there's loads of combat - some of it the most difficult in the game so far - and three bonus missions. Perseus' combat makes this the best of the three.

Buy the Ultimate Shooter Edition at half price or less and hopefully you'll find it worth it."

Plays just like Half-Life, tight and arcadey, but with a story gracefully woven within. Actually scary, thought provoking and challenging. Puzzles throughoutt the game, and well placed cinematics that thicken the plot. Bullet time and being able to drop-kick enemies is an added awesomeness.

76561198016839744,1411483529,True,F.E.A.R. is a Creepy and Awesome game it Is with Doom 3 my favourite Horror Game
76561198044483361,1411470552,True,"My favorite first person shooter over the last ten years. This game is the first FPS I have played which features a planner as AI component. It used an amazingly easy algorithm derived from the classic STRIPS planner, but surprisingly efficient. The AI opponents are tactically intelligent: the know when to ambush, when to flank, when to flee, and when to throw a grenade and flush you out, they can even take advantage of the environment or execute some simple team tactics which may amaze you for a moment, this is truely brilliant for a game made in 2005. 

Enough said about the AI, the other elements are also great: guns are fun to shoot and really pack a punch, you can actually feel the impact of bullets when they land on the enemies or even on the environment; slow-mo feature is fun to use and the visual effect for slow-mo is really cool (for an 2005 game, of course); the levels are cleverly designed, they are complex enough for AI opponents to execute their tactics, as well as for you to take advantage of; the length of the game is just right(it takes me a little over 10 hours to beat on hardest difficulty setting); and, of course, everyone's favorite girl Alma will freak you out(well, not really if you played some real survival horror games, this is an FPS afterall).

The visual of the game is also amazing for a 2005 game. This game uses shadow volume just like Doom 3, which is hard to find in today's games, if you have ever saw how the shadows are like in Doom 3, you can expect the similar effect in FEAR. The colour tone and lighting is just right: a contrast between brightly lighted areas, and shadows lurking around them, and blood trails everywhere.For the horror parts, unlike Doom 3, this game takes advantage of some tricks  usually found in Japanese horror movies, it is better for you to see it yourself, they are neatly executed in the game.

Please try this game if you haven't yet, you will get much more than you expect.

Last, just a few warnings, there are two expensions come with the original game, they are not developed by Monolith Games(developer of the original), Extraction is okay, but definitely worse than the original; while Perseus Mandate is not worth your time, it is really bad. For the two sequels, if you like the original game, you can try FEAR 2, but don't expect the same level of quality from it; and please, by any means, avoid the third game.

Update: For those who experiencing low fps issues, there is a high chance that you are using Logitech G series mouse or keyboard, the game engine has a known compatibility issue with these devices. Just go into the device manager and disable all devices with ""HID"" in their names under ""human interface devices"" and you'll be fine."

76561197995189899,1411442157,True,"To this day I find it shocking that many FPS titles don't follow F.E.A.R.'s AI or weapon mechanics as an industry standard.  Every kill and combat encounter has a satisfying feel to it, from the levels of stopping power and 'oomph' behind every shot to the enemy AI that actually reacts accordingly to the player's approach.  Tactical retreats, using grenades to force the player to move from cover, communicating with each other, using suppressive fire correctly, etc. etc.

I will freely admit, it doesn't take a lot to make me flinch or jump.  Some of the 'horror' sequences weren't all that scary however, slightly unsettling at best.  The game's plot isn't anything profound or groundbreaking, but holds up fine.  The gameplay is what makes F.E.A.R. a gem though."

I remember it getting really positive reviews so I was excited to finally get to play it.  However trying to get this game to play on my modern PC is a nightmare.  I run Windows 8, which I know many of you don't like but it was the only operating system available to me at the time, and I've never had an issue running any games except for maybe a few minor graphical issues in Sim City 4.  F.E.A.R. starts up with the standard copyright and logo screens, but when I get to the Nvidia logo it freezes.  Sometimes I can reach the log out feature on my computer, but most of the time I have to restart my computer because the game either stops me from reaching any other options or it keeps me from using task manager.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm sure F.E.A.R. can potentially be a fun game.  However, in its current state it is unplayable on my modern machine and as such I can not recommend this game to people with a similar setup to mine."
76561198004601492,1411434220,True,"[h1]F.E.A.R. Review
Final Result: 8,9/10[/h1]

F.E.A.R. is a game that holds a special place in my heart. One of my first horror games to the Xbox 360 when it was released back in 2006. What I remember is that I never dared to complete the game. But now, eight years later, I finally picked up the F.E.A.R. Collection to embark on a nostalgia trip. Before giving the full review I recommend buying each game individually and skip the colleciton. You save a few pennies by this.

F.E.A.R. is a very old school shooter; the days when shooters still was quite new and shiny compared to modern shooters of today. To be aged, the game is actually quite acceptable to today's standards. Even though the melee can be a little slow at times the reflex-system, or adrenaline system makes up to any flaws. What is better than to be able to slow down time for a few seconds to see the enemy flying backwards in a wave of gore? And the shooting in general feels very fluid; I would rate the shooting in F.E.A.R. to have much higher standard than your regular Call of Duty game out there. Just enough variation in the choice of weapons. But bare in mind you can only carry up to three weapons, so choose wisely. 

Overall level design and atmosphere is the icing on the cake for F.E.A.R. They have managed to get in the perfect moments for something bizarre to happen. This game is indeed focusing alot on the scare factor and contain tons of scare tactics not for the player with a weak heart. To be honest the intimidation factor is not extremely high as in some modern horror titles. But it contains just enough horror for you to be paranoid around every corner. They did a fantastic job of designing the main antagonist Alma Wade. She will jump at you a dozen times. The only negative factor I can think of kind of ruining the atmosphere from time to time is the A.I. They can sometimes create some hilarious glitches and just be weird in general. But that's probably the price we must take to play an old game. 

All in all this is a great experience. Not for the faint of heart. Old school classic shooter with very well designed scare and horror factors. The visuals are unexpectedly good for a game of this age and live way over some of today's shooters. I think all horror and shooter gamers will very likely love this series."
76561197998133593,1411419863,True,"A classic that will keep being replayed every few years till the dawn of time.
Gameplay is still fun and intense as the first day i played it in 2005, graphicly it still manages to hold up even featuring some nice effects that only in the recent two years  devs started to actully properly use (such as godrays/volumetric lighting).

It's super cheap during sales and totally worth picking up"

Ofcourse thats not why im recomending this game. I recomend this game because its a classic example of a real fps game just like Half life 2. If you liked Half life 2 you will love this game."
76561198078092697,1411391338,True,This game is very underrated. Running through the enemies with the shotgun on slow-mo and headshoting them is fantastic. This game deserves the same amount of love Half Life 2 received IMO.
76561197991825019,1411387957,True,"F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon is a first-person shooter psychological horror video game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sierra Entertainment and the first game in the F.E.A.R. series. It was released on October 18, 2005.

F.E.A.R. puts you in the shoes of ""The Point man"", a secret special ops group of the U.S. government specialized in dealing with paranormal threats, When the game begins, the player witnesses a man named Paxton Fettel taking command of a battalion of telepathically controlled clone supersoldiers, seizing control of Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) headquarters, and killing all its occupants. A strong atmospheric shooter, FEAR does so many things right, but fails in some categories drastically. While the shooting is top notch, dynamic lighting and a solid soundtrack makes this an enjoyable shooter, the lack of enemy variety and repetitive nature of the leves might turn off some players. You are equiped with a fairly diverse arsenal from the basic pistol to more advanced weapons like the Type-7 Particle weapon and many other. The bullet time is superb, the amount of enviromental destruction is here aswel, as particles and walls shatter after you shoot them. It's a briliant showcase of how a shooting something should behave. Not many games offer this level of detailt, to be honest, and this one is quite old. The story is quite nice, a bit generic with the whole *experiment gone wrong theme* and some of the plot elements are delivered via phone calls or debriefed during loadtimes. Nothing too over the top, it gets the job done and keeps the player interested. Overall this game has much to offer, and falls into the category of ""old-school PC shooting games"", reminescent of the goldern era of shooters (1994-2004) with health pick-ups, no cover system, just plain balls to the walls action. Lastly, I'd like to talk about the AI, which has received much praise, and it deserves it. Your enemies use tactics and commands to adapt to certain situations you put them into, responding adequately, making them feel more human than just lines of code. When you shoot them, they react in a realistic manner, thanks to some great physics in the game, overall they perform well enough. 

I'll list specifically what I loved about the game and disliked about it

The good:
[olist]
[*]Solid gunplay
[*]Great amosphere
[*]Good sound/music design
[*]Challenging enemy AI
[*]Destructive enviroments, awesome lighting effects, cool death animations
[*]Sense of dread and solitude throughout the campaign
[*]Exploration is rewarded
[/olist]
The bad:
[olist]
[*]Repetitive level design
[*]Lack of enemy variety
[*]Story is delivered poorly and not developed enough
[*]Short lenght for the campaign
[*]Too many health pick-ups and ammo, not too challenging
[*]Dead multiplayer

This is a 7/10 for me, short of a 9 because of the level design being so primitive at times. A must own."

They aren't explained or introduced save when they shoot you in the face. 

Story could've been a bit more fleshed out as well, even after reading all 'lore' and finding all the messages there was still a general 'wat' as to how all of this came about. Highly recommended if you don't have it already.

You just need to disable everything under HID Compliant  Devices in the device manager. You do not need to disable HID Compliant Devices under mouse, keyboards, or input devices.

SECOND ISSUE RESOLVED: The game will occationally give you a ""server disconnected"" message when trying to load a save game. Some times the save data becomes corrupt for seemingly no logical reason (likely a bug in the save function or incompatibility issue with newer versions of Windows). MAKE SURE you use both regular and quick saves. Using both will minimize the chance of having to start over.

That said, I have come full circle with this game. It gave me the above problems at first. Once I figured out the work arounds, I played all the way through this game and found the experience to be extremely enjoyable. I don't consider F.E.A.R's genre to be horror; It's basically tactical FPS with a horror storyline. You might get a few scares here and there but not many. The atmosphere isn't bad but the real gold is in the tactics and environment. My only complaints are that there could have been a greater variety of weapons and enemies."

The visuals still hold up, the A.I. puts most modern games to shame, the gunplay is tight, fast, and solid, and the writing is actually pretty damn good. 

I recommend playing both at night and with headphones to maximize the experience. While not really scary, the game has lots of subtle ambiance-type inclusions that make subsequent playthroughs really fulfilling.

Also, the level of detail is astounding.

The combat is just spectacular.. AI is good, they take cover, try to outflank, throw grenades and will work together to take you down. You will literally feel the heat of the gun battle.. with contineous fire, the area get's smokey, dusty and the surrounding gets destroyed in an intense fight. The bullet time turns the hectic action into a beautiful battle sequence and 

Once the dust settles, you are ready to press on...  always wondering whats going to happen next. You know your objectives but their is a variable, a big fucking supernatural.. variable that will keep you guessing and  the atmosphere is always tense, and their is a sense of something very sinister in the air.Throughout the game you are haunted by disturbing visions that are geniunely scary and mysterious. But you continue eagerly, you are in persuit of a sinister maniac and you want answers to the visions you see, put all the pieces together.  The sound design is exemplorary and the best I have heard. Brilliant from begining to end. Though the game lacks in variety of enviroments it makes up for it in the mood it sets and  the story it tells. The constant tension will turn into fright when you least expect. Their is no cliches here. Nothing forced, no shock value, gore for the sake of it. The game is molded to scare you pschologically and it succeeds. Though your tough guy with big guns and bullet time, you will tread carefully... like a girl :)   

As the the story draws to it's climax, your heart will pound harder and you will press on without a break or blink. Once the final cutscene plays, it is not an ending  to relax upon and will leave you in awe. Expect the experience to stay with you..  even after the credits roll.

76561198010826134,1410899801,True,"This cult game is a must-play for any fan of shooters. Scratch that, any gamer whatsoever.

F.E.A.R. is a fast-paced, frantic first person shooter developed by Monolith. It tells the story of a silent protagonist known as Point Man who was recently transferred to the top secret First Encounter Assault Recon division because of his inhuman reflexes. The division deals with paranormal threats to the USA, and Point Man is quickly sent on a mission to execute Paxton Fettel, a military experiment gone haywire. But, it turns out there's more to the story when a strange black-haired girl starts showing up out of nowhere.
The game itself is fantastic. It's got everything; the action, the thrilling story, fine-tuned mechanics, smart AI, great level design etc. One of F.E.A.R.'s main trumps is the action that can sometimes prove to be too fast for the player to enjoy; because of that, Monolith gave the player a limited slow-motion ability which proved to be the most well-executed slow motion in gaming to date. The enemies aren't diverse, there are about 5 types you'll encounter, but the artificial intelligence is amazing. Each squadmember knows his role, whether that be flanking, covering, storming in, sniping or otherwise. The story unfolds at a relatively slow pace, but that isn't a problem, as the game knows how to keep you interested. The general atmosphere is another one of F.E.A.R.'s high points; by combining bloody scenes and ambiental music, Monolith managed to create a genuinely creepy experience I'd be happy to go back to in a year or so."
76561197979920013,1410771373,True,"I'm rewriting my review for F.E.A.R. because I do not felt I went into detail enough with it. Previously, it was just: 

""Production values are inconsistent and pacing and narrative can be a little off and uninteresting at times, but for the most part Fear is an enjoyable shooter with satisfying gunplay.""

I still stand by this, but I didn't really explain it. I'm going to do so now, and this review will be pretty long, but I feel compelled to say something more than that for a title that deserves more than that.

The Fear series is a mixed bag. You have the highly praised original, one well praised expansion pack, one mediocre expansion pack, one well praised sequel, one fair expansion pack that should have been free, and one tremendously mediocre shooter that contains none of the elements that made MONOLITH'S game style enjoyable. 

I myself do not follow the non-canon timeline, so for me it's Fear, Fear 2 and then I might also play Extraction Point and Reborn for the fun of it.

The first game in the series was an example of something big. Something that was revolutionary on a *small* scale. This is where the production values thing comes in. The first Fear has fantastic lighting that seems like a more refined take on id Tech 4's ""everything shadowed is unrealistically pitch black"". The refined quality makes it more believable and interesting. It was about two years ahead of its time. Models though - particularly characters - are firmly cemented in the year of its release, if not seemingly earlier, where games from 2004 like Half-Life 2 and Halo 2 excelled in this aspect but were nowhere near Fear in the lighting department (the former of which wouldn't be until a 2007 update). This juxtaposed with the lighting gives us moments where Pointman's fantastic shadow also shows us his low-poly looking head, or his body and the enemy bodies seeming far more dated than the areas around them. Meanwhile, textures are still fantastic for the time.

These are the ""inconsistent"" production values. They seep into the sound as well, but just barely. This does not detract from the gameplay, but I feel is important to highlight when it is a game praised for its good looks aiding in the creation of the atmosphere. 

Said atmosphere is great. You'll fight a plethora of enemies in some tense moments, some situations more explosive and dangerous than others, some more quiet and with a vibe of survival horror. 

A great strength of Fear is its weapon pallette. Almost everything is fun to shoot. There's a rocket launcher that's relatively standard and an SMG that isn't too great, but they're made up for incredibly by the Penetrator and the ASP Rifle. They're also well varied, as a staple of the series (at least until the third game) was the mixing of weapons with sci-fi elements and modern day weapons. Great gunplay. Can't really describe it, you'd have to play it for yourself.

A great downside (and easily the biggest) of Fear is the way the game progresses, in regards to maps and narrative. The story starts out fairly active and then becomes much less involved. You'll go through what feels like filler trying to reach an objective that is one of the main things holding your interest in playing for hours in a campaign. It eventually comes back around, but they could have made it much better in this regard. Worse than that, and the source of many ""filler"" moments, is that the majority of Fear is *literally* a ""corridor shooter"". A handful of levels are just a series of office cubicles and crawlspaces. Ocassionally something will occur or be there to change things up, but shortly afterwards you go straight back into the office cubicles and crawlspaces. The shooting is still plenty fun, but it becomes monotonous very quickly, particularly at moments when you're just fighting soldiers. It's not bad enough to ruin the game, but it does hurt the game. This is one of the things that was made much better (in my opinion) in Fear 2, along with pacing, though that game had its own downsides as well. It's also popular to hate for...I really have no idea why, as someone who enjoyed the first game greatly and Extraction Point as well before the sequel was even released. I digress.  

Most FPS games I feel are well played in two long sessions - the first half, a break, and then the second half - because the majority of FPS games since the invention of the FPS take about 6 to 12 hours to complete on average. With Fear, it's totally different. This is a game I highly recommend, but recommend broken up into chunks.

Overall, it's something I'd consider just about required gaming for shooter enthusiasts - PC or console (as it was ported, along with the expansions) - because it's ultimately a satisfying game, and it's also a remnant from a moment in the past where shooters of all forms were reaching some sort of strange peak, just before a great regression to simplistic gameplay."

Negatives:
-A rather bland aesthetic"
76561198056657711,1410486940,True,"I have never been a huge fan of FPS games, but I remember playing this a number of years ago, and it always stood out as one of the few truly exceptional FPSs. Even years later this game still looks amazing.  The brilliantly designed lighting and shadows make  this game an immersive experience and certainly add to the spooky atmosphere in a way that a few jump scares never could. Finally, the amazing physics engine makes it immensely satisfying to run up behind a hapless guard and turn them into chunks with a shotgun or pin them to a wall with the aptly named ""Penetrator."" This game is worth every penny. 

P.S. Slow motion flying jump kicks."

9/10

Everything works out of the box. No need for ini tweaks or external programs. Although there is no fov options the game adjusts fov on its' own. There is suppose to be a way to adjust manually but I found default option working really well.
Graphical gliches are farily minor. I encountered this weird camera behaviour when hugging walls and leaning.
While most GUI elements are spanned they are not streched and don't distract gameplay. Bigger issue is that ui is really small.
There are couple of ingame ""movies"" (eg. the eye thing at the start of the game) which are streched but they only last 1-2 seconds only consists of cheap jump scares.

Pics are taken with 5760x1080 resolution (23"" monitors), maxed out graphics and 4xaa. On my system game runs really well even in heavy fire fights.

76561197998785996,1410290660,True,"I got F.E.A.R as part of the Humble WB bundle (the one with the Arkham games) and decided to go through them again since I hadn’t tried the 2 expansions before. For some reason, Steam bundled the first game along with the 2 standalone expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate together into a massive 17 gigabyte installation. This is weird since the 2 expansions are so similar to the base game (in graphics and gameplay) that they probably should have just shared most of the same data files and shrunk the size considerably. The three games have different Steam entries too, so once F.E.A.R is installed, just choose to “install” Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate and it will pretty much instantly install them.

You play the part of an unnamed First Encounter Assault Recon soldier, though they refer to you a few times as the point man for the team. Your squad has about 4-5 people but you get separated from them right away so there’s no squad based gameplay. Your primary mission in the game is to take down Paxton Fettel, a psychic commander created by the Armacham private military contractor. Psychic commanders are supposed to control “replica soldiers” who are basically genetically engineered clone soldiers. Fettel went insane for some reason and his replica forces are tearing the place up. As the story progresses you find hints about Armacham projects called Perseus and Origin, which are somehow related to Fettel’s creation. Throughout the game you also see visions of a little girl who appears out of nowhere and vanishes when you get close. There are a lot of “dream sequence” type hallucinations where you learn about Alma, the little girl, and what they did to her at Armacham.

Fear is a first person shooter with a slow motion “power” that you can activate with the push of a button. It’s explained in the story as your character having off the chart reflexes, and you can use it to give yourself an advantage in battle. In reality though, it’s not as useful as you might think. You’re not actually moving faster in slow-mo, it’s mostly just to give you more time to aim your shots (you can’t dodge bullets like Neo). Reloading and aim correction from weapon recoil still slow you down. The thing that really sets Fear apart from other games at the time was its advanced enemy AI. The replica soldiers actually behave like real human players a lot of the time. They throw grenades if you’re under cover and they try to circle around you. Most importantly though, they don’t sit still in combat, making it a little harder for you to flank them. Fear uses a health/armor system where you have both a health number and an armor number and constantly find armors lying around in the levels. You can carry up to 10 med kits which you use manually by pressing a button. You can carry up to 3 weapons and can switch them around by taking the stuff your enemies drop. 

Pros:
+Excellent enemy combat AI
+A bunch of scares thrown in when Alma pops up or hallucinations occur
+Immersive storyline

Cons:
-The game’s graphics are pretty dated now. I don’t think you can get more than 1280 x 1024 resolution. And it’s a large download for such an old game.
-No real “boss fights” which are usually fun in first person shooters
-The enemies have great aim. It seems like they can hit you no matter how far away they are.

Mini reviews for the 2 standalone expansions:
*FEAR Extraction Point:
This is a non-canon continuation of the story. That means that it if you play the sequels, FEAR 2 & 3 will ignore what happens in the FEAR Extraction Point story. The game is standalone, which means you don’t keep all the upgrades and gear that you found in the base game. There really isn’t anything new in Extraction Point except maybe 1 or 2 weapons that you only use for a few minutes. 

*FEAR Perseus Mandate:
A few new weapons appear which actually make it into the sequel FEAR 2. So even if the story isn’t “official” they were clearly paying attention to this game.  This one has some pretty mean new enemies including a difficult boss fight. Definitely better than Extraction Point. Perseus Mandate’s story is separate from the original game. You play a different person in a different FEAR squad, though there are a lot of references to events in the base game happening at the same time.

Overall I’d give FEAR a thumbs up if you can handle the large download and don’t mind some poor (by today’s standards) graphics. You cannot just download the base game; you automatically download all three at the same time (FEAR + Extraction Point + Perseus Mandate). If you could pick and choose, I’d recommend you skip Extraction Point. The experience is better if you play in the dark.

76561197993209652,1410201221,True,"Excellent FPS game that still holds up to this day. The atmosphere, the lighting, the physics, the gameplay and the level design all come together to make this a solid classic. I feel especially the dynamic lighting deserve extra praise; there is something wonderful about jumping from the sight of your own shadow. There are a few jump-scares thrown into the mix, but I would say the horror element of the game comes from the creepy atmosphere.

The plot is relatively thin, but it works. It delivers what little there is of story and it is consistent within its own universe. Mostly it succeeds in moving the player forwards so you can enjoy the gameplay, the differing ways to approach a fight and still give you a bit of a chill even though you are a soldier with superhuman reflexes.

Favorite part of the game is in Extraction Point, where, after having fought your way through countless enemies, a whole squad of them run away at the sight of you, with only a lone soldier covering their retreat. THAT is attention to detail and how you make the player feel like a badass.

In short, if you like classic shooters like Half Life or No-One Lives Forever, you will love this. If you want to see what the fuzz is about; this game is nine years old at the time of writing, I recently played through it, and I would argue that it looks better than modern games. It certainly plays better."
76561198022907411,1410193839,False,"One of the most overrated FPS games of all time.
(I have also played this back in the day and thought the same so don't give me ""for it's time"" bull)

No personality at all, bland enemies, bland guns, bland characters, generic gameplay, lame tacked on bullet time mechanic that feels like a forcefull addition just cuz someone thought it's cool as opposed to a fleshed out game mechanic.

Don't expect to be scared it's probably one of the least scary FPS you can find, I don't really hold that against it, just an FYI.

This feels like one of those russian mass market FPS games that you get thrown in your face fo free when you buy a magazine or something.
 No real enemy variety, expect to fight special forces and security guards all game and they don't do anything other then move, shoot and occasionally throw a granade. 
Add bland generic guns to that and every firefight feels the same and boring as hell. Here's how it works, you walk around the corner, see bad guys, activate bullet time, kill bad guys, repeat for 6 hours.
Levels are bland sequences of empty corridors with no real atmosphere or character to them.

Good points: AI is pretty decent, graphics and effect were pretty good for it's time, story is interesting enough but it's told in such a way you won't care about it at all, since all the ingame characters are kindergarden level of ""black guy"", ""fat guy"", ""asian chick"" and offcourse ""radio boss man"".

All in all go play Duke 3D or something."

My only complains is that the mutiplayer dosent work but is fixed with Fear Combat. Another issue is that even though it has great atmosphere and very effective soundtrack, the actual horror can sometimes not be scary and some of the horror gags get really old. Its hard to tell which horror element can kill you and they are scripted so if you miss them, you miss them. But this is made up by the game`s DLC Extraction Point.

Sure, it’s all smoke and mirrors but it does a decent job of creating the illusion that you are fighting actual people who would like to survive their encounters with you. This illusion is maintained through little details like how enemy troops panic when you lob a grenade at their feet, or push over tables to make improvised cover, and travel through adjourning rooms in an attempt to flank you.

76561198025088062,1408970435,True,"They just don't make games with these mechanics these days. Impressive tech in this game, fun too."
76561198029042119,1408943569,True,"F.E.A.R. or First Encounter Assault Recon, is a psychological horror first person shooter, amazingly well designed and one of the few games that always made me feel uneasy while playing it. This game will make you jump out of your chair, and always when you least expect it. 

You play as the Point Man of the First Encounter Assault Recon, a secret United States organization that investigates and deals with paranormal phenomena. You get called into action after you are informed that Paxton Vettel, a Psychic Commander has seized the headquarters of Armachan Technologies and killed everyone there. His reasons are unknown at first, and it's up to you to discover why. He controls an army of clones, and you have to fight and investigate your way through the mess that was created. 

The story is more than meets the eye. It is not predictable, and it is told to you in subtle ways. You have to explore your surroundings, listen to voice recordings and pay attention to certain laptops to find out what is going on and the reasons behind the disturbing events. The way the story is told is brilliant, because each player will fill in certain gaps in any way they want, and experience the game in a very personal way. The overall story line however, is well crafted and some points in the plot are completely unpredictable.

F.E.A.R. is a horror experience like no other. The mood is everything in this game, and the way the lighting, sound, hallucinations and Alma (more on her later) combine to the feeling of isolation and fear, it's almost certain this game will make the hair in the back of your neck stand up, you will never take a hallway, a room or even an open setting for granted. You will never feel safe in this game, both from enemies and from hallucinations, it will creep you out. It takes elements of Japanese horror, where the mood, sound and shadows create the bulk of the atmosphere, and in this type of game, less is certainly more. 

Alma is part of why this game will scare you at times. It is hard to imagine that the apparition of a little girl can be scary, but in this case it is extremely effective. Every single time Alma shows herself, in badly lit areas combined with the game's excellent sound effects, it WILL leave you breathless. These moments are tense and completely unexpected. Forget everything you know about creepy games. F.E.A.R. rewrites what a creepy game is all about. The best way to see why Alma is a character that is often quoted as one of the creepiest ones in gaming, is to play this game and see for yourself. 

The game's visuals are still quite good, despite this being a game with quite a few years. The textures and lighting effects are well done, and feel realistic. The most impressive aspect about the visuals are the particle effects, which really come alive in slow motion. The game offers you the option to engage firefights in a slow motion type of way, called Reflex Booster in the game, allowing you to slow down time and make easy some complicated situations. It is usefull against several enemies who attack you at once, and you will need this gameplay aspect, the AI in this game is probably the most intelligent I have ever faced in a video game. Enemies will call for backup, try to pin you down with supressive fire while another one flanks you, use the environment to create cover and even ignore orders not to get in harm's way. They are really challenging, and it's a big part of why this game as aged so well, nothing comes close on modern first person shooters. There is a good variety of weapons as well, some of them extremely rewarding to use. The one thing all have in common, is that no weapon feels too weak, they all have their use even later in the game. Finding out which ones to take with you is part of the experience, as the game limits the amount you can carry, 3 is the maximum. Firefights can be brutal. Depending on which weapon you use, you will see body parts flying and blood spilling quite a lot, it is not for the faint of heart.

F.E.AR. is a must buy. It manages to be an amazing horror/creepy game and a superb first person shooter with a very good story. It will scare you and make you feel helpless at times, but it is an experience you will never forget.

The Good

-Creepy Atmosphere
-Amazing story
-Visuals, Sound and Particle system
-Alma is the creepiest little girl ever put into video games
-Enemy AI is brilliant
-Good selection of weapons

The Bad

-Game might feel a little short to some, takes about 13 hours to finish without rushing
-Could have used a little more variety in the environments

76561197995512229,1408829156,True,"Almost a decade old and still no other game out there that has come close to convincing close quarter fps interaction at this level. The ai is still something to behold, balls out crazy good. Great gunplay in some relatively bland but nevertheless very smart level design, allot smarter then Monolith ever got credit for. 

Just be sure to play this at a difficulty that is still challenging to you and forces you to utilize the slowmo into the game hard so it can show all its glory to you. 

Story is neglible, there's some fun jumpscares and they can build some tight tension in the game but the gunplay is where its at and it's still a benchmark that not many other fps reach, a shotgun feels truly like a shotgun, a pistol is as nimble as a pistol, and that damn needlegun brings out everyone's inner sadist.

As I Alt-4'd my way off this game I wondered, what is the story of that door. Did it have a family? A wife? Maybe a few kids? Why is this relevent? It's not. So it's pointless to talk about. When I was told this games was scary I thought it was Star Wars Prequel scary. And I'll be dropped kick by Jar-Jar Bink if that wasn't what I thought going in. But, that door man. That god damn door.

What is it?
First Person Shooter with the ability to slow time for a limited duration

The Good:

+On a technical level, the graphics are pretty amazing. 9 years later and this game still holds up. Note: I was playing with everything maxed out but it still speaks to how good the game is. The lighting is equally impressive.

+The particle effects are fantastic. Every gun battle truly feels like you just finished an epic showdown, with debris, dust ,blood and other effects flying everywhere

+When the game was released it was noted for having great AI. This is still the case, and in some regards better than most games today. Enemies will flank you, try to run away when injured and in general try to work together to take you down. 

+Any first person shooter should have a good sense of weapons and feel to them and this game doesn't disappoint. Every gun feels unique and offers a certain strategy to how you play. The shotgun in this game is extremely satisfying to use. Slow down time, blast an enemy with the shotgun, watch debris fly everywhere, move on... 

+ Throughout the game, horror elements are present, I have played the game numerous times and there are still segments of the game that make me jump.

The Bad:

- IF the graphics are great technically, then artistically the graphics are pretty bland.

-On that same point the environments can feel very 'cut and paste' giving you the feeling like your running through the same areas over and over again. There are a few times where it can get confusing where to go because everything looks so similar. 

-Multiplayer is dead

-The games story is pretty decent and serves only as a backdrop for you kill things but what really brings it down is that stupid characters that act completely illogical to the circumstances. 

Conclusions
I have played this game many times in the past and recently finishing the game shows me how well this game holds up despite its problems.  Despite its problems it really deserves to be played at least for the shotgun alone.
"
76561197972606560,1408600093,True,I have been playing the FEAR series lately and it still one of my favorite shooters.  The audio and visuals are crisp and firing has a visceral feel to it.  The first game in the series was the best in terms of horror elements - I think it was the pacing.  The second in the series was a bit of a disappointment in the weapons category - the shotgun especially.  It lacked the sharp report of the first game.  The add-on content is all solid and adds to the mythology.  A great shooter all around.
76561198086134949,1408479030,True,"good game, recommended"
76561198093858863,1408398629,True,Okay okay okay now wait A MINUTE this game this game is better then a full house in a poker hand like look at that beauty a Classic to a new game called F.E.A.R 3 like wow F.E.A.R  was a game that was made to my measures we have a horror themed game and a fps like wow the gameplay is like massive play you lose a second of attention just a simple message or email notification you can get the possibilities of death you look to your tv you get a bullet in the brain like yeahh it's hardcore and I like it you get to focus you get scared you get unfocus you die and I don't talk about one single game I talk about the series the triology is like awesome well except the F.E.A.R 3 I can't talk to much about that since I haven't played it but F.E.A.R 2 is amazing game with better graphics and more horror to the ones that think that games aren't hard anymore I want to see you making a live stream on hardest mode and without using the slow motion if you clear the whole game then well you're a trooper
76561198039542833,1408348835,True,"With my new style of reviewing games, I guess I should write a more 'professional' review about F.E.A.R. as well.
I'll try to keep things simple. The reason why I love FEAR so much and it's one of my top 5 games of all time is because it knows what it wants to do and does an amazing job at that: being an amazing action shooter with some creepy supernatural elements in between. 
Good:
-Graphics, sound and the like: FEAR still looks pretty nice despite being nearly nine years old today and the sound design is as solid as ever. God, I love the gunfire in this game, it really sounds threatening. And don't get me started on the delicious Voice Acting by the Replica Soliders, that sounds extremely menacing.
-Gunplay and combatt in general: the game perfectly balances between being a realistic and tactical FPS and being not too supa dupa serious guise. Even the 'normal' weapons like the SMG or shotgun still feel great because you really feel like they pack a punch, especially the shotgun, that destroys anything that comes in your way. And then you still have the more fancy weapons, like the repeating cannon, the nail gun (god, nailing enemies to walls never gets old for me) and the particle gun, or as I like to call it, the skeleton gun (because it vaporizes (is that even a word?) any foe you hit with it, leaving nothing but some dust and bones). Melee feels great too and it's really satisfying to give a Replica Soldier a slowmo kungu kick to the face. Said slowmotion works great and is necessary if you want to survive, because..
-The AI: everybody has heard of FEAR's great AI by now. And while it's also the combination of good level design and intelligent scripting, the Replica Forces you'll encounter in the game really feel like smart and dangerous opponents that will destroy you if you don't use your wits, especially on higher difficulty, where it becomes 'kill or be killed'. These guys will, thanks to their awesome voice acting, insanely well co-ordinated teamwork and despite being clones still having personality, always carry a very special place in my heart.
-The horror: FEAR is inspired by japanese horror and it shows. Surrealistic and disturbing imagery, darkness and silence to drive you slowly insane, 'did I just see anything or was it just my imagination', all that. The game does have a few 'jumpscares' but nothing in the likes of 'spooky face appears with loud noise'.
-The story: FEAR tells it story through clever use of voicemail messages, date on laptops and the like. You'll really want to find out the truth behind project origin near the end of the game.
-TECHNOLOGY: objects that don't just stand there and get bullet holes when you shoot/melee/blow them up, the ability to see your legs, reflections in puddles of water, FEAR's got it all. Suck it, Bioshock Infinite, this nine year old game beats you here without any effort.
Bad:
-Dislikeable characters: some characters in FEAR (TALKING TO YOU, NORTON) aren't really likeable and you'd wish they'd just shut up so you can go and slowmokungfukick some more cloned soldiers. It's not really an issue, though, and more a matter of having something I dislike so people don't call me a fanboy that can't give negative criticism.
-Linear and repetitive scenery sometimes: you'll be fighting a lot of the times in the same type of buildings, though I didn't mind too much and this problem gets solved near the end of the game. There's still plenty of variation to make it bearable.
Overal, I give FEAR a 9/10. The same score I give to its two expansion packs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, who are in my opinion the true 'sequels' to this amazing game and add some interesting weaponry, areas and enemies while keeping the amazing formula that makes FEAR so damn great."
76561198022610289,1408346583,True,"Another gem in the horror genre, it's frantic action scenes do great to compliment the tense hallway crawling horror scenes. It get's a bit too addicted to jump scares on some levels, but that is the case with many horror games anymore so it can be forgiven. But it does have good psycological horror, instead of just putting a gross picture in front of your face with loud music, you will have the constant feeling of being watched, being stalked. Though the gameplay is pretty much half life with a slow mo button when you get down to it, its concept, universe, weapons and lore are very, very unique.

The storyline is another great part of this game, its very engrossing and pulls you in, unraveling the secrets of shady corporation has never been this interesting, except maybe ultor in red faction. 

All in all, great game, it will test your nerves, especially extraction point, man was that freaky."

76561198004313894,1407874969,True,At retail price i do not recommend as there are problems with the game at max settings as I use a high end computer though it doesnt really matter as the game is old and the lowest settings are close to similar at high in detail ( I checked out F.E.A.R 2 with max settings and it ran so smoothly). Overall story is really quite undescriptive as details of the story is from flashbacks. The game is not bad but for a game to have a high score i'd say this is around 70-80 but for its time I would understand that im basing this on modern games. Either way for 10$ i'd price it at 5$ at the current generation.

76561198136340185,1407722639,False,"One of the eeriest games I've ever played. Sadly the experience was marred due to the continuing existence of the Logitech bug.  Be warned that if you have Logitech hardware, you will need to resort to community workarounds just to make the game playable.  This is not acceptable to me."
76561198020507904,1407710271,True,"This is a great FPS. Combat has you using guns (keine Scheiße), melee (slide and bicycle kicks are dope) and a cool slo-mo ability. You might think that the solo-mo is just there so be cool, but it's acually pretty useful. The enemy AI's are very smart, have quick reflexes and are generally deadly, so slowing down time really helps you with that. The graphics are excellent for 2005 (the lighting is still impressive today). Judging by the title, you might think that there are some horror elements in this, and you are correct. In between firefights, there are hallucinations or visions that are supposed to creep you out. While they didn't really scare me (just one small jump), they succeed in giving the chills with disturbing visuals and great sound design. The only gripes I have with it are the fairly repetitive scenery, somewhat short length (almost 7 hrs for me) and the fact that it took a small while for the game to really suck me in. Overall, a fantastic FPS that anyone into the genre should try."
76561197982814776,1407662045,True,"When F.E.A.R. was released way back in 2005 (another world it seems) by game studio ""Monolith"", PC-gaming and the FPS-genre was still trying to find its way after the highly succeceful ""Doom"", ""Quake"" and ""Half-Life"" - series. People still liked the old school shooters, but wanted something new, something ""fresh"". 

Along came Monolith Productions, the Washington-based studio that made a name for itself with games such as ""Blood"" and ""No One Lives Forever"" more than a decade earlier. Combining some of the best things the FPS-genre can offer gamers with a touch of inspiration from the game ""Max Payne"" and the dysotopic film ""The Matrix"", we got a ""horror-shooter"" with Slow-Mo. 

Looking back on the game now (and playing it over), almost nine years after it was released, it is still highly addictive and fun to play. The graphics are a bit dated, but the Ai still packs a punch, and that little girl ""Alma"", still keeps popping up when you least expect it.

Don't forget the flashlight in those dark and eerie places, trust me, you'll need it.

+ Fun gameplay
+ The Slow-Mo feature
+ Environments that are destructible
+ Fast controls

- Some leveles can be a bit repetitive
- Doesn't support hi-res resultions (it can be fixed)
- Lengthy (some parts)

I must say it's a timeless classic that still lives up to its nostalgic memories, although it has aged in its own right, mainly due to the graphics that are far more plain when compared to more modern games. The enemy AI in the game is amazing. It always surprises me how much of a fight they put up compared to the dull AI of modern games like Crysis 3 or Metro. I highly recommend FEAR if you still haven't played it after all these years. Due to the game's age you may have some technical difficulties that you'll have to wade through before hopping in. It's not particularily optimized for 1080p, so even on a system with a 4.2GHz 8-core processor and a GTX 770 you won't get over 100FPS."

76561198035200698,1407429954,True,"Fast-paced action, dense atmosphere, great story and a rather creepy little girl. This is F.E.A.R., an immersive first person action experience that makes you feel like a absolute badass... until 'she' appears.  

F.E.A.R. is set in the near future, around a spec ops group made for fighting paranormal threats known as the First Encounter Assault Recon (abbrieviated F.E.A.R.). Their Mission in the game is to eliminate a telepathic criminal called Paxton Fettel who is able to control an army of telepathy-controlled clone soldiers. You play as the F.E.A.R. group's Point Man, whom of which has very sharp reflexes, a major part of the gameplay (I'll talk about that soon). As you play through the game, you will discover some darker things in the story, and you will see that maybe Paxton and his army are not the only threat. At certain points of the game, you will see a little girl dressed in red. You will think, 'Who is this girl?, What does she want? Why is she around in a middle of a spec ops operation?'

One thing is for sure though: she aint a sweet little thing, after seeing what she does to your team at the near beginning of the game...

F.E.A.R.'s story is wonderfully complex and dark, making you question what the hell is going on, and the twists and turns are great to see. And the ending was more than fitting for such a dark game. 

One thing about F.E.A.R. is that, unlike many other FPS's, its a very moody game. The lighting is dark, the soundtrack and ambience is subtle and creepy, the camera suddenly gets some blurry filters now and then and you will usually find yourself isolated, all alone without the company of your allies from your radio or even your enemies. At certain points of the game, F.E.A.R breaks away from it's epic gunplay (I'll get to that later) and decides to give you little moments of isolated terror. As soon as you hear your radio emanate static, you will get the feeling of dread. At times like this, you may think you are all on your lonesome... but you will always get that feeling like something is watching you. Suddenly all sorts of bizzare things start to appear as you walk through the darkness, sometimes the scenery starts to change with no real warning. These typs of  cutscenes definately do not feel like filler and make the game feel more alive, not to mention are incredibly well made and its an awesome way to break away from the action and build up atmosphere. What's more, they get scarier and more surreal as the game progresses, and they are worth playing all the way through just to see the outcome.

OK, now for gameplay. As you may already know, F.E.A.R. is a First Person Shooter, and it has a hell of a lot of trick up its sleeve. You are able to carry up to three weapons and there are three grenade types. Healthkits are avaliable too, but it's not like you pick one up and automatically get some health out of it. They have to be used manually, so you can heal yourself when you are in the midst of combat. Think of it as health regen, but more controllable. But what sets this game apart from many other FPS's is its niche: The Point Man's Reflexes. You have a small bar at the bottom of the screen which is to display how long you can use these reflexes. When you activate this, everything goes slow. Bullets become more visible, enemies slow down and your weapons fire with less recoil.

Yes, this is awesome.

Whats more is that you will NEED to use this. The weapons in the game are so strong enemy soldiers will rip you up within seconds. Even pistols are deadly! Not to mention the AI itself is incredible, another one of F.E.A.R.'s strong points. The Three Weapon Limit may seem demeening at first, but as I already said, the weapons are powerful, and are made even better with the reflexes. If they gave the player the incentive to use the slo-mo without a three weapon restriction, the game may be too easy. Weapons range from a pistol (which can be dual wielded), submachine gun, assault rifle, precision rifle, nail gun, shotgun, a rather messy rail gun that can burn all the skin of a poor guy's body and tons more. Each weapon feels different and can be used for many situation and none of them are useless. Choosing which weapon to take with you isn't a question of ""Which is a better weapon?"" but of ""Which weapon do I like more?"" I myself kept the handguns with me all the way, because  I liked how strong and fast they were. What is also great is that you can carry three different grenade types at once, being Frag grenades, Proximity mines and Remote bombs. Althoguh they are limited in quantity, they can be devastating. The player can also Melee attack, which isn't limited to just hitting things with the stock of a gun; you can also slide kick and bicycle kick, plus Melee attacks can kill most enemies with one hit. Despite having only acress to three weapons, the player has enough options in combat anyway thanks to powerful and agile melee combat and the unique Slo-mo Reflex ability, allowing strategic play. Health Kits themselves are very plentiful  - a good thing since you will find yourself on low health very often. And aside from guns, grenades, and first aid kits there are also Upgrades to boost your health and reflexes, usually hidden in the levels. Collecting these is vital, as they will help you stand a chance in the more chaotic, intense fights. Exploring for secrets is something that Modern shooters barely ever do and, while FEAR isn't technically a Modern shooter, it shows that such a thing can work as a rewarding element in a shooter. The level design itself it fantastic, with wide open areas providong some badass slo-mo run n' gun action as well as some really tight corridors with numerous routes of approach and things for the player and the enemy AI to hide behind. I think I should emphasise a bit more on the enemy AI: It can asses the situation, try to flush you out, flank you, stick fighting defensively when it can and soldiers can synergise incredibly well, keeping close to each other and backing each other up. It made me feel like I was actually fighting well trained soldiers. Combine powerful weapons, abilities with great potential, threatening enemies and grand level design and you can get some beautifully orchastrated gunfights... possibly some of the best ever. 

Graphicly the game is... slightly dated? The game looked the part for its time, but I don't think the textures look as great as they used to be. But hell there are a load of other noteworthy things about the graphics. The character models are terrific and FEAR has to have some of the best particle effects I have ever seen in a game. Effects during the more atmospheric scenes are impresive too, such as sudden transitions to different places.

I'll further emphasise in the audio: the game sounds incredible. The loud volume of the guns complement their power, the voiceacting is stellar, the sountrack ranges from gritty and action packed tracks to more forboading, subtle ambient tracks which suit the mood and atmosphere for the game perfectly. And the ambience is incredible, especially during those atmospheric scenes.

Just so anyone reading this knows, if you buy F.E.A.R. from Steam, you will get its expansion games, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, for free! Both of which offer some neat new weapons and enemies and are both great. 

F.E.A.R. sadly isn't a perfect game. While the level design is great, it seems to be a bit... linear. Through most of the game you seem to be going in one direction which can be a bit mind numbingly dull at times, but when it's during the more creepy scenes of the game it fits well though, as if you are taking a ghost train ride.

Overall F.E.A.R is a well written, heart pounding shooter that knows how to balance it's incredible action segments with it's more disturbing and atmospheric moments. Highly recommended for gamers looking for something that rewards skill with thrills."

76561198076611852,1406913382,True,"I feel that F.E.A.R. offers a challenge that you do not see in many modern FPSes. Each area that you move into presents you with a different squad to face, with a different set of obstacles and cover. The cover is non-interactive, meaning that you have to be able to judge rather or not you can hide behind a particular set piece. When dealing with these squads, they will actually try and flank you, and do a good job of drawing your attention and laying down supressive fire. After a good combat sequence, the rooms look like they have been through hell, making the game actually feel like you were in the fight, leaving huge craters in walls and desks. The satisfaction of throwing a grenade into a tight room and watching all the debris fly out is marvelous. The story is there, but it is told from many differnet perspectives, and it is often easy to miss something that could clue you in on what is going on. The flash-back cutscenes are 2spooky4me and often do give you the gitters, especially when fighting through a huge squad and you are walking through an empty room. F.E.A.R. will test your mettle and will have you realizing that going in guns-a-blazing is no longer an acceptable strategy."
76561197966032718,1406799668,True,"F.E.A.R. is a science fiction horror shooter, blending influences from Hollywood action movies and Japanese horror films. It's solidly designed but lacks originality.

The story features elements seen elsewhere plenty of times already, including cloned super soldiers, psychic abilities, mysteriously returning dead characters and a creepy little girl turning up unexpectedly. The principal antagonist is somewhat memorable, but the story itself is not, though it is presented in a way that does make you want to figure out what's really going on.

Graphics used to be a strong point when the game came out. They are holding up decently, but due to the dominant grey and brown tones the game is not particularly pretty to look at.

Gameplay is where the game still shines. It features precise gunplay, a Max Payne kind of slow motion ability and an outstanding enemy A.I. Enemies take cover, throw grenades, circle around you, retreat and flank you whenever they can, providing you with challenging opponents.

Level design, on the other hand, is genre standard. You'll sprint down plenty of tubes and corridors, do your share of air duct crawling and generally keep circumvent locked doors. Your objectives are usually limited to leaving the area. There is limited puzzle solving, but the puzzles only ever involve finding and pressing buttons to clear and obstacle. The game can be completed in about 6 hours.

F.E.A.R. is a bit of a modern shooter classic, but I found it to be fairly average. It's A.I. and gunplay shine while the story is unimaginative and the level design is drab. Pick it up at a discount, but do pick it up."
76561198056922244,1406428255,True,"Absolutely fantastic. The sensation of firing in slow-motion with the shotgun is simply phenomenal. It's disappointing that we don't see games like this anymore. While the story is undeniably reminiscent of a B-movie plot, the execution through cinematics keeps you intrigued about what's coming next. The enemy AI is also remarkably well-done. Definitely worth a try!

76561198014056666,1406176175,True,"F.E.A.R. is still a good game and a solid shooter. The slo-mo combat is still a really nice feature which feels almost as slick in 2014 as it did in 2005. Several things about the game seem rather dated at this point. The lack of a 'sprint' features makes the movement feel more clunky than most newer FPS titles. Additionally the graphics, especially some wall textures look particularly bad now, even for a game from 2005.

Nonetheless, F.E.A.R. is quite scary for those unacquainted with the best of the survival-horror genre. Its story is also interesting enough to capture one's attention. Though it is often hard to follow its many twists. Without ruining anything, the end is slightly underwhelming, and to such an extent that it really feels like it was rushed. It is a good game, however, and well worth picking up for anyone interested in a paranormal FPS. 8/10.

Its expansion, Extraction Point, although blessed with a laughably poor (verging on the non-existent) storyline, and few minor tweaks to the original game, is about half as long as the original campaign and actually manages some of the best combat and scariest moments in the whole game. Extraction Point is good, mindless, paranormal FPS action. 8/10."
76561197994281375,1406141420,True,"(This review is mostly for FEAR Extraction Point and FEAR Persius Mandate.  It has been too long ago since I played the original FEAR to review in detail.)

FEAR 9 out of 10
FEAR EP 8 out of 10
FEAR PM 7 out of 10

FEAR EP and PM are add-ons for the cult classic FEAR.  On a timeline EP runs first and them PM however it doesn't really matter in which order you play them as long as you start with FEAR. 
You play as an elite commando with super reflexes which boils down to a slow motion system.  And what a slow-mo system it is, one of the best ever.  Nothing beats going slow and sniping with the Gauss rifle. 
The theme is a horror story.  You take on lots of bad guys, ghosts and psychics. 
Despite myself I really enjoyed play FEAR EP and PM.  I am not a fan of horror or gruesome stuff.  The game play though makes up for it in spades. 

The good: 
1. Awesome action. 
2. Great weapons.  Some of the most fun guns in any game ever when combined with slow-motion. 
3. Pants wetting music in EP but not so much in PM. 

The bad: 
4. EP and PM have no story to speak of.  The games unearth additional parts of the FEAR story.  Well sort of since I didn't really get it.  Poorly explained. 
5. You won't understand how the pieces fit together if you don't know FEAR.  The FEAR protagonists are there but they play cameo roles.  
6. Bad abrupt ending for EP.  For PM it was pretty good. 
7. FEAR came out just as check point systems started becoming popular.  If ever there was a game that should have used a check-point save system it was FEAR (+EP +PM).  The games loses tension due to the ability to save at any point. 

The ugly: 
7. Way too much gore for my liking. 
8. Its as if they really tried too hard making the game scary.  It actually becomes very predictable.  Gore + music = enemies ahead. 

Do play FEAR and if you enjoyed that play FEAR EP and then PM."
76561198066166636,1406042802,True,"A great game that really knows how to set the mood through use of sounds and visuals cues.  One moment you'll be fighting groups of enemies in an epic fire fight when out of nowhere random mumbling comes out of your radio and the next thing you know, you're walking down some dark hall way catching small glimpses of a young child or naked woman. Then you're back in the room with dead soldiers everywhere, bloods on the walls, screams from some nearby area ande body parts all over the floor . Lights flicker on and off as scraping sounds can barely be heard in the distance leaving you feeling as if something dark and evil is watching you.....

Great visuals.
Solid controls and gameplay
Awesome story and great use of atmosphere.

There was some bugs and glitches but nothing that breaks the game.  The graphics are still decent and the enemy A.I. is better then most of the A.I. seen in modern day games.

76561197966244188,1406016181,True,"Imagine Michael Bay making a movie after binging on those Americanised-Japanese horror movies from ~2000 (The Eye, The Grudge, The Ring, etc), for me this is basically 'F.E.A.R'. I loved it. 

It's a First Person Shooter with some horror elements, it mixes the 'bullet-time' features of the Max Payne franchise, with some dark, twisted horror images from Fatal Frame. The story is pretty straight-forward (much like the corridors you'll spend most of your time walking through), but does it's best to be mysterious as it dripfeeds news and information to you via laptops and answering machine messages left behind.
In truth the story isn't really the hook for the game, or at least it wasn't for me. I was drawn in by the bullet-time mechanic where you can slow down time and rip carnage into the enemies who try to stop you as you hunt down Paxton Fettel. There was some strangely satisfying about turning a corner in slow-motion, and blasting your cannon like shotgun into the soldiers and heavily armed troops. The red mist of blood, and the giblets of limbs and organs spraying, slowly and awkwardly across the room. I'm not crazy or anything, but the visuals and warped audio mix just gave the feature 'something', something extra to Max Payne which is perhaps best known for it's bullet-time. 
Besides, I'm a total sucker for insane ragdoll physic deaths... you know what; I'm not doing a good job of painting myself as a mentally sane, upstanding member of society here, am I.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=288504762

Moving on.

Visually the game has held up since it's release in 2005, even if I did mistakenly start playing without checking the graphic settings (which were all on LOW to begin with). So do yourself a favour and ramp all the settings up to maximum if your rig can handle it. If not, don't worry it'll still look decent for a 10 year old game.
The only real issue I had was with the audio, which seemed strangely unbalanced and left you feeling like your guy had the loudest footsteps in the world. However, in saying that (and I'm no expert) the guns made a great noise, and the bullet cases/shells hitting the floor was pretty satisfying too. 

In short, F.E.A.R was a fun, FPS game with a few jump scares based around it's 2000 era horror drawn inspiration. A very linear game made memorable be a few setplays, shotguns and bullet-time. Don't wait a decade to play this game like I did."
76561198045011614,1405881123,True,"I play games like Counter Strike, Left 4 Dead, Battlefield, Team Fortress 2, Half Life 2, and the like.
These are first person shooters that: require reaction time, make you feel empowered, require strategy, manage your supplies, and make the threat of occasional death fun.  

F.E.A.R. is all of these, similar to many other FPS games, in my opinion, especially Half Life 2.  The game features a slow-mo, and gives you a lot of supplies and health.  The AI is smart enough to occasionally flank properly, and pop up unexpectedly.  When you die (likely due to a grenade or explosion, as nothing else seems to kill me), you feel like you deserved it.

The story too, nicely compliments the game.  It's a simple story that lightly waves away why there are so many enemies, and while you are able to pay attention to the story and pick up the intersting nuances, it does not detract from main draw of F.E.A.R., the gameplay.

If you are not an FPS fan, this is a fantastic example of the FPS genre, and liking this game or not would make an excellent metric to compare to other FPS games."

76561198039500657,1405431112,True,"FEAR is a decent old school shooter with a good plot, impressive atmospheric effects, a satisfying weapon arsenal, and a decent implementation of bullet time into gameplay. On the downside, the levels are the most linear I've ever played. The first door you can open is usually the one you need to go to. While the game seems to suggest stealth, the reality is you can only stealth kill the first enemy you see--the others instantly go on alert. The enemies were also pretty forgettable except for Alma herself, though the ""bosses"" you face in the game and the two expansions are invariably suits of powered armor. Don't expect Crysis-level detail from the engine. FEAR was already a bit dated when it came out. On my computer it was clunky but playable. I don't want to make this review sound wholly negative--I grew up on old school shooters and this is one of the best. Just wait for a sale--$9.99 is a bit pricey at the moment."

Pros: 

- Extremely impressive combat AI
- Combat in general with the AI
- Good atmosphere most of the time
- Fairly good pacing
- Interesting plot

Cons:

- While the levels were put together well and offer a good spatial complexity, there is an attenuated theme and texture variety.
- Too much ammo (personal pet peeve :)
- Limited enemy selection. Aside from the basic replica soldier with different skins and HP/armor (skins look good), there are about 5 other enemy types: heavy soldiers, mechs, flying mechanical things that shoot lasers, stealth kung fu commandos, and ghosts. Minus the regular replica soldiers, all the other enemies numbers, individually, are in the single digits, save the ghosts, but youll only see them once.
- More environmental interaction would be preferable personally. You are basically limited to opening and closing doors, breaking things like glass, and pushing the button that advances the story.

I played this game through when it was released, but never got the expansions or sequals. I got the bundle of all of them on sale, and am glad I played through the original again. Being almost 10 years now since I originally played it, I can now really appreciate how good the AI actually is. FEAR's AI was revolutionary at the time, and remains as a high standard that few FPS games get to (mention some if you can, Id like to know of more games with impressive AI like this).

As the player, you are as vulnerable to bullets as the enemies, and more so on higher difficulty levels. To be good at countering the AI, a person cannot approach the enemies as they would a normal FPS, meaning you cannot charge into combat and hop around a lot, or jump out into the open with guns blazing, with a little adadadadadadadadad dancing here and there. Try that, and even on medium, youll get torn to pieces. 

You also cannot wait for the soldiers to come to you; if you do, youll be waiting a loooong time. You must actively engage the majority of them as they use cover to wait for you.

Cover and leaning around corners is essential, especially on hard difficulty, and without question necessary on extreme difficulty. Expose your body for more than just a second (and sometimes not even), and youll take damage. Stay uncovered and in LOS to multiple enemies, and youre sure to die.

""Reflex Time"", or bullet time, is slow mo that can be activated for short periods at will. It is not really necessary to use it unless playing extreme difficulty, but is a lot of fun at times, allowing you set up some impressive moves.

The combat AI and battles with it is where this game shines, and remains truly impressive, even a decade later. While there are some shortcomings to FEAR, the stellar AI mitigates much of their effect.

Highly recommended."

Straight up this is a FPS. What sets it apart is that you are able to use a slowmo effect that is really well done. With it you can get many shots in your enemy and dodge rockets. The enemies are really smart and will not run at you. You have to make sure all of your areas are covered or they will sneak up behind you and kill you.

This game is also a horror game. It's in no way survival horror but that does not mean its not creepy. Uncertainty of the situation, beautiful lighting,  messages on phones, and a demonic girl appearing once in a while will keep you on your toes and afraid of whats around the corner. As the game goes on you get more and more sucked in the story as if it were a dream.

While there is mainly one type of enemy in the game the variety of the levels comes in it's design. Take cover in offices, snipe mofos from a window of an apartment to another, be forced to destroy a mech that shoots you everytime you try to shoot the weaker guys, etc.

76561198045938722,1404665626,True,"What is F.E.A.R.?
--
F.E.A.R. is a classic first person psycho-horror shooter, with a fluid bullet time mechanic, and a number of phenomenal jump-scares.
--
--
Who would most enjoy F.E.A.R.?
--
The game is a bit dated now, but it has aged decently. It's not a particularly action packed FPS, though it's far from dry in that department. Where the game really shines, however, is in keeping the player constantly wondering what might happen next. It's packed full of ambient tension, and just enough jump-scares to keep you constantly on the edge of your seat. It's a fairly challenging game, definitely not for the light of heart, but if you're looking for a rush, and can get over the dated engine, F.E.A.R. is definitely for you.
--
--
Over-all: 70%
A solid game. Worth playing through for sure, especially if you plan on playing the later titles in the series. F.E.A.R. holds its own as a ground-breaking title in the psycho-horror genre.
--
Mechanics: 3/5
The mechanics aren't perfect, but they serve the needs of the game. Mobility is slightly cramped compared to most modern shooters, but the fluidity of the bullet time experience definitely compensates in this regard. Despite the clunkiness, it's not enough of a weakness to distract from the fantastic immersive experience the game provides.
--
Experience: 5/5
The greatest strength in F.E.A.R. is it's ability to pull the player into the game. Despite the dated audio and visuals, the game still manages to immerse the player to a degree I haven't experienced in a long time. The audio mixing, though dated, and overly simple, is fantastically orchestrated. Ambient static, strategically placed, and dissonent instrumentation instill a very desirable sense of paranoia. Headphones are definitely recommended. Some of the dialogue gets a tad redundant and obnoxious, but can definitely be overlooked, given the phenomenal work done in the other departments. The visuals are painful at times, especially during cutscenes, but during the actual gameplay, with the bullet time effects at play, and the visual interruptions that are part of the psycho-horror theme, you almost completely forget all of this. The game is visually dated, for sure, but still manages an incredible depth of immersion, adding tremendously to the experience.
--
Balance: 3/5
The fight blance is pretty poor over-all. Some fights are far too difficult, especially if you've run low on ammunition or health kits due to a string of accidents. That being said, this does add to the tension at times, which is great, as long as it doesn't become frustrating. The AI is good enough. It's simple by today's standards, but it's not dumb enough to be noticably distracting, and that's more than enough in this case.
--
Longevity: 3/5
The game itself is 21 missions long, each ranging between 15 and 45 minutes (though you could probably speed run some of them very quickly). There is no immediate replay value, but if you give yourself a few months or years to forget the specifics of the game, it's likely you'll enjoy a second play-through at that point.
--
--
Expansions:
--
Extraction Point: Extraction point is a decent expansion. I would not recommend it, however, as it distracts from the fantastic finale' F.E.A.R. leaves you at, which, incidentally, is where F.E.A.R. 2 picks up. That being said, it's not bad enough to suggest not playing, if you're really interested in the series, beyond just the experience. There are some great, fights in the expansion, and while the over-all quality is slightly lower than the base game, in my opinion, it still provides a few new twists and plenty of lore to keep you entertained. The finale' of Extraction point does a poor job of explaining itself, and is slightly baffling, but the adventure there is possibly worth it.
--
Perseus Mandate: Perseus Mandate is over-all, a terrible expansion. It plays more like a poor action FPS game than a psycho-horror, and drags on far longer than I wish I had the patience for. I would only recommend this expansion to players who find themselves fascinated by the lore of F.E.A.R.. It provides a bit of extra insight in this department, which is nice (though distracting from the experience of the series). There are several intersting gun battles, but almost no jump-scares, or tension at all, for that matter. If you're on the fence about this expansion, I'd suggest against it."

76561198063353325,1404534908,False,"Old game, I remember I played F.E.A.R 2 before playing this, and that's when it was brand new stuff. I thought the second was a great game, and usually games that come after are usually shit on a stick by comparison. However, this doesn't seem to be the case, I'm glad they learned from their mistakes here for their second game, but the checkpoint method (although useful) is so obtrusive, if you're trying to get a horror game, make sure it's immersive so as to keep the person feeling like they're actually in some danger, rather than stopping the game completely so you can save. Nothing takes you out of a game more than the entire game stopping mid stride to save and F.E.A.R does this perfectly. Not only this, but the combat is completely shit, I know it's an older game, but there is literally no indicator for being hit by a bullet other than your life meter way down in the corner (which in the heat of combat you wouldn't even glance at) and because of this, you just die, outright, I didn't even think that the enemies were hitting me, what couldn't make a hitting noise? Even a little red spot on the screen when a bullet hit you? Hell even after it hit you just something to fucking show you just got shot, nobody just keeps walking when they get shot as if nothing happened. 

As old a game as it is, it's really nothing I'd recommend to anyone, and I don't own a pair of nastalgia goggles large enough to see this as a shiny turd even."
76561197974399433,1404500687,True,"F.E.A.R. = Half-Life merged with Japanese horror flicks.  Still a great game after all these years.   Somehow I missed F.E.A.R. back in the day but I just played it for the first time and felt a little bit like I did the first time I ever played Half-Life, especially the enemy troops and their radio headsets.   The graphics feel a little dated sometimes but man oh man did they nail the shadows.   I don't think Dead Space or any of the popular horror shooters today have ever gotten it down as well as F.E.A.R.  The reflex system is fun, but really it's just an old school shooter with health and armor drops throughout the levels.  I've played scarier games, and there wasn't really a moment that made me jump in my chair, probably because it still felt like a traditional shooter, but it's a good mix of horror and shooter that is still fun to play.  The multiplayer is shut down when you buy this, but the is a group online that rebuilt it for free, you'll just have to download their app, and forget about it on Steam."
76561198055096987,1404421331,True,"It's really hard for me to give this a thumbs up or thumbs down.

It's just mediocre. I mean YES at the time, it was REALLY GOOD. I mean, 4 thumbs up kind of stuff. But then again, that was when I was really little, and really easy to scare. Now I'm all grown up, and have been playing games like Amnesia, or Outlast.

So, if you're looking for a scary game. Go get Outlast, if you're in it for the slow-mo mechanic, then I'd say give it a go, but the combat is really repeditive, so you might get bored after a couple hours.

The story is pretty... OK? I mean, it's not the best thing I've ever heard of, but it's definitly not the worst.

All in all, I'd have to give this a 6/10. I would give it a 5 for being perfectly plain, but the slow-mo is pretty damn cool at some parts."
76561198026981420,1404412067,True,"This is simply one of the best single-player shooters available today.

The enemies are smart and react quickly, and the way the levels are designed allows for interesting encounters with them. Every weapon, from the high-capacity, accurate pistol to the heavier cannons you'll find in the mid and late game, are powerful, distinct, and serve a purpose while being incredibly fun to shoot.

Most levels are simply warehouses and office complexes, but most modern shooters are drenched in gray anyway so you might not even notice the fairly bland environments. That doesn't mean FEAR is devoid of style though. Sharp shadows, lots of smoke, sparks, and other particles, and a fondness for fire and blood give FEAR a distinct art style that other shooters, especially its sequels, lack.

There is a story to be had for those who really want to engage in it. There is a cannibal, mad science experiments, psychics, and a clone army. Players that don't care about the plot can skip -some- cutscenes and ignore the answering machine messages (the FEAR equivalent of System Shock 2's audio logs), and be apathetic to the dialog.

Despit its name, FEAR is not a scary game. It tries to have some spooks here and there but its strength is in its unparalleled gunplay. Each expansion gets progressively duller and there is no option to not install them. Extraction Point is worth playing if you enjoyed the base game."
76561198044564543,1404247452,True,I was honestly a little scared at times.  Okay..maybe more than just a little....
76561197989073969,1404176046,True,"Random tango comes out of a door and sees me. ''SHIT'' Then i proceed to spray him with bullets.
This game has some lovable AI. They are tactical and smart, altough sometimes they are quite frankly stupid.
Tango 1 throws a grenade, Tango 2 walks over it..
But probably the best thing about them is that they don't hide behind cover and just sit there. These guys will move forward and flank you from any position possible. Hell. I even ended up playing cat and mouse with a last man standing once..

The overall ''Level'' Experience is somewhat linear but you still get the option to choose between 2 ''entry'' Points or, 2 points to attack from. Which somewhat adds up for the linearity of the levels.

Hidden upgrades are located around, they don't really make a difference seeing as this game isn't hard.

I amped it up from hard to extreme and i can't say i find myself dying too much.. Even with slo-mo.
There are surprise moments that kills you tho.

And the horror aspect.. There are some really creepy scenes that are easy to miss sadly.
The ocassional jump scare is nice. Predictable but nice.
By the time you've shot up a couple bad guys you forget about the horror aspect of the game and then it hits you right in the face. So that is kinda fun.

Overall enjoyable experience. The weapons are pretty decent. Not too much to choose from but they feel diverse and different enough that it makes up for it.

The story is good too.
Decent music that adds to the suspense.
Had to deduct a point for difficulty tho.. There is plenty of ammo and health kits everywhere.
9/10 would play again.

76561197960446706,1404164810,True,"FEAR, and its two expansions, in one neat bundle. I'd recommend them for three reasons.

First reason: The games are more tactical shooter than any modern FPS. The ""high difficulty"" setting in FEAR is all right, but in the two expansions, it's much harder. Why am I mentioning this? The AI in FEAR is smart, and will not hesitate to shoot you. Unlike most ""modern"" shooters, the AI in this will try to flank and attempt some form of attack on the player. The bullettime ability makes the AI a lot easier to manage, but running out of it means you'll be killed by a group of three.

Second reason: It's the only cinematic shooter on the market. The amount of dust and destruction to the enviroments, along with the slow motion, gives FEAR unique movie-style moments. Unlike other shooters (COD and BF series namely) that try to make it SEEM cinematic with skyboxes and pathetic story time, FEAR is all about shooting and making the shooting look good.

Third reason: It's creepy at times. FEAR isn't exactly scary, but it does have some scares.

Just remember, FEAR: Perseus Mandate is the only one that will function properly on modern PCs. The original FEAR and the first expansion require some tweaking to function properly."
76561197999130740,1404152629,False,"Great in its day, but very outdated now. It would probably be a fun game with an overhaul, but as it stands now, its not really worth the time. If someone were to go back and update the graphics and controls, it might be worth revisiting, but all it is now is a headache inducing, bouncing, ugly mess. The only reason I even picked it up is because it was part of the FEAR bundle on sale durring the Summer Sale. I'm hoping that FEAR 2 and 3 are as good as I remember."
76561198017910875,1404127206,True,"FEAR is a first person shooter with light horror elements. The story evolves around a member of First Encounter Assault Recon (which has to be one of the most forced acronyms on video game history) who is pursuing a guy called Paxton Fettel who is being a huge shitlord and commanding cloned super soldiers to kill people through telepathic abilities. 

FEAR really plays like 'Hollywood Shootout: The Game'. Everything that is shot seems to break, or take a ridiculous amount of damage, and the player has the ability to use slow motion. This really feels awesome, and makes every shoot out feel badass.

Also helping the gunplay is the AI. The AI is willing to flank, retreat, throw grenades, and even just push your position. What most modern game AI can't seem to do on hard, these guys can breeze through on normal difficulty. This game is at least challenging which is a great change from most games of today. You also tend to only take on squads of 3-4 at a time, and this really works. The combat is challenging without relying on having a bunch of dudes bum-rush you. 

Weapons all feel good. You've got the standard assault rifle, SMG and pistol. The shotgun is gutsy as hell and will tear things up. You also get the penetrator, which is like a slow, powerful assault rifle, a burst firing scoped rifle, a particle rifle which can strip the flesh from most enemies in one hit (basically acting as a sniper rifle), an automatic cannon, and a burst firing rocket launcher. Some of these later weapons don't have a lot of ammo around, which is a shame as they are fun as hell to use.

My biggest gripe about this game is the horror. It's honestly not scary, it's just annoying. A little girl staring at you is only a little spooky to begin with. Eventually I found myself just wanting to skip the flashbacks and wanting to kill guys again. The game is also quite repetitive with it's environments, but the firefights are so good that I honestly wasn't too bothered by it. 

The base game is easily worth $10. I'd give it an 8/10."
76561198025074064,1404117046,True,"A game that not only is horrifying but fun to play.  

This is hard to describe, but everytime I pulled the trigger, I felt the weight of the gun, unlike in Call of Duty or Battlefield.  The enemy A.I., especially on the higher difficulties, is extremely refined and intelligent, usually attempting to seek cover whenever possible, get clear of grenades and other explosives, and attempt flanking maneuvers or adopt new tactics if I am too much to handle.

In terms of horror, the game relies on its atmosphere, situation, and classic tropes, like the creepy little girl.  While the game's story is scary, the expansion pack, Extraction Point, cranks it up a notch.

Overall 10/10

Please note a few things if you care about the story:  Both Expansion Packs are technically considered noncanon with the release of F.E.A.R. 2 and F.E.A.R. 3.  However, Extraction Point is itself a good finish for the main story.  Perseus Mandate is more of sidestory and does not have much to do with the overall plot.

Should you want to get the next games, be aware of a few things: You do not have to get the DLC for F.E.A.R. 2, because it is technically rendered noncanon by F.E.A.R. 3.  F.E.A.R. 2 can be considered just as horrifying, but it does have more action elements, which is hit and miss.  With F.E.A.R. 3 there is Co-op play, but it does tend to make the game less scary and more like L4D or Dead Space 3 Co-op."

Inventive and unique weapons, creepy locations, excellent movement and aiming, and an engaging story. The AI is noteworthy and takes full advantage of the circuitous level design so that crafty enemies team up to flank you as others keep you busy to the front. One of the best game engines ever made with precise controls, atmospheric dynamic shadows, and soupy particle dust effects.

It's one of the best games I've ever played and I revisit it frequently. I play it every time I upgrade my PC just to see how much nicer and smoother it looks, and it's drop dead gorgeous on my 144hz monitor. This game scales beautifully with modern hardware and only gets more immersive and spooky, aging gracefully and remaining relevant.

This is Monolith at its peak and far surpasses its sequels and most other first person shooters over time. A high point of the genre and arguably the very pinnacle."

The atmosphere is dark and foreboding, the weapons all have a punch to them, and the enemies actually behave intelligently and challenge you, even on the lower difficulty settings. Originally I purchased it for the 360, but when I saw it on sale I had to pick it back up. The graphics are kind of underwhelming nowadays, but for a game from 2005, it's suprisingly pretty.

Extraction Point - 2/5 - Way more repetitive than the base F.E.A.R. game, more (cheap) scares than action. Ending is incredibly cliche, but then again, maybe it wasn't cliche at the time that it came out. Doesn't really explain much in terms of F.E.A.R. story, you could easily skip this and not miss much. Completed in 5 hours.

Perseus Mandate - 3/5 - More action than scary moments. Just use the shotgun and you'll win. More story content than Extraction Point. Fairly enjoyable because there was a new enemy to fight. Completed in 5 hours."

76561197972050764,1403982400,True,"Taking cues from Japanese horror films as well John Woo action films, FEAR creates a beautiful hybrid between the two genres. The game puts you in control of a member of F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) a SWAT team of sorts that specializes in dealing with the paranormal. 

The game consists of basic first person shooter mechanics, but the game's real curve ball was bullet-time (or slow mo) à la Max Payne. Combining that with its amazing graphics (which still hold up fairly well) and particle effects, as well as spooky atmosphere-- all which made the game stand out amoung the other shooters at the time.

Think the slow motion made the game to easy? Think again, F.E.A.R features some of the most amazing AI ever programed into a game. Enemy squads would work to flank you, and if you hid somewhere too long you would most likely find yourself face to face with an enemy hand grenade. Killed one enemy? The remaining squad would notify its members via radio and strategize accordingly. 

The game wasn’t just a pretty and intelligent, but extremely atmospheric thanks to its level and sound design. Dispersed between the intense gun fights you would find yourself in dark spooky hallways encountering Alma, a creepy ghost girl heaily inspired by The Ring. Sometimes she would appear in the corner of your eye, other times she would outright startle you, and then there would be moments where you would find a corpse with its flesh melted off and hear a girlish giggle in the distance.  Shooters that try to be scary often fail miserably, but it was with great skill that Monolith actually pulled off balancing horror and action in FEAR.

The game was followed by a number of expansion packs as well as a couple of sequels (each worse than the last) which failed to capture the magic of the first game. Monolith later revisted similiar terrirtory with its equally excellent “Condemned” a first person horror game that focused more on hand to hand combat. Both games are worth your money and time."

This will put you on edge. Though it's not NEW and the graphics to show age, it's so well developed you'll be screaming for help when you play.

No, really. It's terrifying. Hence the name.... A perfect mix of horror and action will have you looking around for secrets and ammo just as much as behind your back...

Buy this game. And buy the second one too."
76561198037650969,1403954756,True,"This game came out all the way back in 2005, however, it still looks and plays so well, it kicks ass of many modern shooters. 
Devs seemed to use a lot of clever tricks to mask the shortcomings of technology at the time, and instead maximized what already worked well. 
Good use of AI and them communicating (especially on hard difficulty) integrated into a great level design often creates the feeling that you’re fighting against real opponents, not just some dumb bots. Plus add awesome gunplay with flying debris everywhere and great sound design, and it creates a truly unforgettable experience. 
Graphically game also still looks quite good, once again, it’s the clever use of lighting and effects that really sell the image, but if you look too closely at details, the age of the game becomes more apparent. The atmosphere is still superb though. 
I’ll also give a bonus credit to the composer, there were multiple points where tracks really picked my attention, the use of the “tribal” vocals, let’s call them that, created this raw and unexpected feeling that gave me goosebumps.
I won’t go too deep into the story of the game, as it’s more about the journey, but there’s enough things to keep it entertaining. 
Overall, in my subjective opinion, given the time when this game came out, it’s easily one of the most impressive and fun FPS I’ve ever played. 

Oh, and since I’m mainly playing on Steam Deck Oled now - yes, it’s perfectly playable, there’s a great controls layout from the community which is set by default, and the game works at completely stable 60fps (you can try higher) with the battery life of at least 6h or more on all max settings. Remember the time when it was one of those benchmark games? Now you can enjoy it in your bed.

P.S. during one of the last scenes I took a screenshot for myself and got a feeling of strong deja vu. It turns out I made the exact same screenshot about 9 years ago, which I completely forgot about. I was sure that back when I first got a Steam copy, I never finished the game, but it turns out I did. I don’t know why, but it felt quite eerie when I realized this and was looking at two of the same screens of Alma, while listening to haunting music in the background. It’s completely irrelevant to the review and I wasted your time, but I just wanted to share how this game haunted me even outside of the gameplay experience itself. Anyway, go play."

76561198025062476,1403915714,True,"This is one of my favorite games. While F.E.A.R. 2 is very obviously creepy, what sets the first F.E.A.R. game apart is how incredibly normal it is. It could almost be a Rainbox Six game, and definitely feels like one at the beginning. Then slowly, inconsistencies start piling up, and the feeling that develops isn't one of horror, but that somewhere, something went wrong. 

Gameplay-wise, you can expect a shooter that feels like a lot of shooters from 2005. It plays a little like Half-Life 2, without the weapon variety or physics. It's not so generic as to be boring, but it's  nothing to write home about. In a way, that generic quality drives the something-out-of-place vibe brought about by horror elements, but admittedly makes replays not as fun.

If you're looking for a Dead Space or Amnesia-like experience, you might be disappointed. But if you want a solid shooter with constant eerie undertones, I couldn't recommend a better game."

Excellent graphics, a rather advanced and aggressive AI, an interesting antagonist, and enough challenges and surprises to keep you on your toes.  The horror element of the game isn't that strong, it's more like a horror theme than intense horror.  The gore may be a bit intense, but the scariest moments came when some marine managed to sneak up behind you, rather than the spooky or supernatural events occuring around you.  As someone not particularly fond of horror, this was a nice balance."
76561197973840927,1403907847,True,"This game is the best FPS of last gen. I would actually argue that it can compete with the greats. The atmosphere and sound is incredibly well done. The lighting is fantastic, combined with the physics of everything makes for eerie situations. The slow down mechanic is nice and is coupled with fantastic gunplay. Weapons and shooting feel incredibly satisfying and the AI is pretty sophisticated. All of this combined with a decent story make this game fantastic. 

Also, health packs and no iron sights."

76561198086054607,1403898031,True,This game is very good. I'm not far in and I already love it. It holds up better than most older games do and I reccomend you picking it up for it's fun combat and occasional terrifying moments.

76561197994319342,1403895567,True,"Fear is one of those games that has a lasting memory. No, it didn't revolutionize the horror genre or provide an experience such that the FPS genre is better off as a whole, but it did enough things right with such a unique setting that I still remember nearly every level of this game almost 10 years later. 

The combat in Fear, all things considered is actually pretty fantastic. The bullet-time mechanics provide an optional means for less experienced gamers to gain the upperhand on the enemy and can be ignored by veteran shooter fans looking for a tougher challenge. The gunplay feels good and the enemy uses intelligent tactics most of the time to try and snuff you out. 

The horror aspect of the game comes in bursts and segments the different action components of the game. While some of the horror comes from the sudden jump scares, there's really a lot to be said about how well the developers were able to build an atmosphere of terror and loneliness. The lighting and music are enough to keep you moving forward even though the hair on the back of your neck is sticking straight up.

The last part of this game that surprised me was how solid the story was. I was thoroughly enthralled with how focused this game directed you forward and how the set pieces were so interesting;I wasn't bored by the game's linearity or it's lack of choices. 

While not on my top 10 list, F.E.A.R. is a game that every shooter fan should play through at least once

Salty's Verdict: 8/10"

The music, the gameplay, the atmosphere, the characters - just amazing."
76561197969240447,1403893851,True,"What more can I say about this game that hasnt already been said? I remember back in 2005 getting my brand new PC with an AMD FX-57 CPU(Which I won in a competition), Dual Nvidia 7600GTs and 2GB of RAM. I was on a lull with PC gaming between 2000 - 2005 because I wasnt old enough to get a job and my Dad who was always into PCs for flight simulators he tended to have the latest and greatest hardware of the time but then lost interest in PCs so he wasnt really willing to keep upgrading.

After I got the money for a new PC this was one of the first games I got with it and almost instantly I feel in love with it. It reminded me of the old 90s shooters I would play, it was fast, looked good, sounded good, guns felt great to fire and it was fun. Admittedly the game is showing its age but the gun fights are still vicious, the sound design is still top notch and the AI is alot smarter than most AI in more modern shooters.

It's an outstanding game that is up there with the FPS greats like Duke 3D, Half Life, Quake etc. It's a shame the later games went for more mass appeal and were terrible in comparison to this, the later games lost everything that the first game done so well. 

You don't get shooters like this any more and if you love shooters and horror then get this game."
76561198002282099,1403892945,True,"Alright, this is going to be short, but a must read if you bought this before you ever had steam like me. :)

So here is my story. I was really young and didn't have a gaming computer. I first tried playing this game when i was about 11 or 12. All my friends had heard about it and played it. One of them bought it for me to try to play in the dark at midnight in my basement with cobwebs and shit.

I still remember that night because I was absolutely terrified because of what I had heard of this game. Needless to say it did not disappoint my 11 year old imagination. Although this game doesn't terrify my anymore I decided to purchase it again just to make a clean run through it with my gaming PC. :) Now onto the review.

First off I'll get the rating out of the way for you ADHD people. 9/10 Why? Read on.

A.I. (Now we are talking for a game released in 2005 keep in mind) The A.I. in F.E.A.R. is top notch on a scale that matches that of Halo, which is very good contrary to popular belief. Never did I encounter a bug with the A.I. where they didn't search for me and pursue me or sneak up behind me and scare me shitless. I like that in a game haha. I give the A.I. a 9/10 too.

Artwork/Textures/Graphics: Not that this is what makes a game, but you can not say that it doesn't contribute highly to your decision in buying games. Again this is a 2005 release. The artwork is never foreign to environment and atmosphere that this game is trying to set which is Dark and Scary. With shading to make you think twice about going around a corner to the shading of the fire on Alma's back, (or however you spell her name that little bitch) this game knows what it's doing when it comes to matching it's art with it's environment. I give the Artwork/Textures/Graphics a solid 10/10

Gameplay (from beginning to end): From the slow beginning of the ride in the car to the fights with the soldiers to the encounters with Alma, F.E.A.R.'s gameplay keeps you on edge and makes you thinkt hat you'll die at any moment. Oh, and the ending is to DIE for. ;) I won't get too in depth because I don't want to spoil anything, but just know that this game is worth every penny. I kneel before this game, bestowing it's gameplay with a 9/10 rating.

ADHD version: Worth the money. Pick it up. Still is a terrific game. Alma, that is all. 9/10"
76561198014447930,1403892900,True,ALMA will make you shit bricks!

76561198097735285,1403888944,True,This game really gives me the scare. The ambient is so unsettling. Alma is watching in every corner. Armacham clone soldiers were the happiest time for me. 4 thumbs up!
76561197983606251,1403883455,True,This game made FPS slow motion a big deal by doing it really really well. All its combat encounters are brutal and really satifying.

76561198068028590,1403832930,True,Good old fashion FPS. Pretty linear in terms of story line but it still manages to keep it somewhat interesting with a few different path options. Definitely better than the one-path FPS's of today. 8/10.

"
76561198057972142,1403750781,True,"F.E.A.R. is a game that is like a mix of Counter-Strick, Japanese style horror and the Matrix lobby fight scene. And that's a good thing. 

The main draw of the game is the very intensive gun fights. They are very enjoyable and visually appealing thanks to the ""bullet time"" feature and the very destructable environment (so expect to see lots of debris and dust clouding your view). Thankfully this game has very good A.I. enemies so some planning is needed when attacking. So this is what the game is basically about: epic gun fights. The storyline is pretty weak and boring honestly... some psychic was used in science experiments which resulted in clones, mind control, creepy ghosts. The story is given gradually through PC data and phone messages you collect but that's so tedious I just made up the story as I went.

The soundtrack is pretty damn cool. It seems very fitting, like it could easily be in a Die Hard or John Woo film. The controls are perfect, easy to master. Visually it's great, still holds up today.

With F.E.A.R. you get two expansion packs (Perseus Mandate and Extraction Point). P.M. is the more fun of those two while E.M. seems to focus more on the horror/psychic theme.

So yeah, this game is a must if you love FPS games. The storyline is generic but the gameplay is very addictive."
76561198047668775,1403726216,True,"To be perfectly honest, this game was above-average. It wasn't amazing, it wasn't bad. Just about above average. This does not mean it isn't worth playing though.

I originally thought this game was supposed to be way scarier than it was. It was creepy at parts, but never really scary. This did not affect my overall experience of it though, since the gameplay (mainly the awesome slo-mo feature) was very good. The beginning of the game had me right off the bat. I wanted to answer all the questions the game slowly opened up, and find Paxton Fettel and stop his evil plan. Then, the game kind of trailed off though. I was just going through somewhat generic FPS missions, with barely any leadway in the story other than some laptops. To be honest, I was kind of lost, and maybe that was because I was focusing on doing a let's play at the same time, but I just felt bored like I was not accomplishing anything other than chasing the main antagonist and ultimately failing every single interval. Then though, the last couple missions kicked it into high gear. It started answering everything I wanted to know, and led to an ""explosive"" conclusion along with a cliffhanger that really makes me want to continue the series.

So that's basically it. It was a great concept executed very well, the influence of Japanese horror films really helped this game stay unique, the slow-motion mechanic was awesome, the ending was great. This game would have gotten an even better score if the middle of it wasn't so boring for me, but since that was the case, it's a 7/10 for me. Now it's YOUR turn to see what YOU think and play this game, because it's worth it."
76561198105356012,1403725670,True,"Got this as part of the Humble Bundle last year. Having played the demo version years ago I thought it would be nice to try out the full game especially considering some of the positive reviews that others have given it. 

Despite being an older game the campaign was fairly decent and was packed full of action in each chapter/interval. The enemy AI in particular was rather challenging at times which is excellent, definately better AI than some of the newer games, including F.E.A.R 2 and F3AR. Obviously being an older game means the graphics are a bit dated but when maxed out they are comparable to some of the cheaper or F2P games on steam. This is also be a good thing for people that don't have amazing PC specs or are laptop users as pretty much any modern machine from 2010 or later can play this game on medium graphics (some higher intergrated GPUs such as the Intel HD 4000 or the AMD hd 6550d can max out the settings on this game).

This game does have some basic jumpscares (it is called FEAR for a reason after all) so be wary about buying this game if you are prone to easily getting scared, however most people should have no problem playing this.

I recommend this game to users who are looking for a fun game packed with action. The game itself is fairly cheap already at £6.99 but I often see it at £3.49 ( sometimes less) during the sales. F.E.A.R is one game definately worth picking up."

76561198018562724,1403642486,True,"F.E.A.R. franchise is my favorite (except F.E.A.R. 3)! 
Specifically: the story and the horror elements.
The first F.E.A.R. game is scarier than the new ones, but if this would've looked the same way as the F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin did, I would've liked this even more... 
For that F.E.A.R. 2 is better in graphics; atleast in visual level, not in combat effects - they are superb in the first game. 
But aside from the second installment for now...

The atmosphere, scares and soundtracks - at some parts, are great and terrifying (not in a bad way, oh no xD) at the same time in F.E.A.R.

It's challenging shooting enemies without slowing time with Slow-Mo. I should correct myself xD! You are not slowing the time itself as you play the protagonist of F.E.A.R., Point Man. 
Instead, you are moving so fast that everything around you seems to slow down. 
It keeps me wondering, if enemies too have Slow-Mo reflexes, because they are faster than would expect from the regular FPS games... But that's because of the A.I. I would guess.

[Temporary edit, I hope. . .] Because of WB Games' greediness, I recommend buying this and the second installment (because of Reborn DLC) from GOG.
So you don't have to buy crappy F.E.A.R. 3 ^^"

76561198032431345,1403546089,True,"9/10. Some of the best, most satisfying shooting mechanics In a game that I have ever played. The gunplay is simplistic, but literally perfected in every aspect. 

The plot is good, but doesn't really ramp up until the sequels. Forgettable characters, all except one...

The horror in this game is rarely jump scare focused, but builds up to the few so expertly that a couple of the scares are some of the worst I have EVER experienced. 

Fear does a good job of creating an atmosphere that makes you so very uncomfortable in and inbetween the shooting galleries. This game does a great job of messing with you and making you paranoid with its artful use of psychological horror.

All in all, it's an amazing, satisfying shooter rivalling the best out there with its masterfully built gunplay coupled with the atmosphere and design of some of the greatest horrors. It hasn't aged beautifully, but some outdated level design and visuals is hardly going to dampen your experience of one of the greatest shooters to hit PC."

The graphics, although not as flashy or deep as modern standards, are still pleasing to the eye. The environments are textured rather sparsely and in generic forms like warehouse, office, or lab, yet they all look sharp in 1080 and max AA. 
The game's AI which was lauded in 2005 is still impressive; better than many games since. They will not stand still and wait to get shot, neither will the ""wait by the door and shoot them as they come in"" work in F.E.A.R.
The story though was not taking any effect on me because I did not want to wait around answering machines to hear voice messages that comprise the story. Aside from that, it was a blast to go through the campaign, moving from one slo-mo shootout to the next."

76561198031867092,1403232978,True,"First Encounter Assault Recon is one of the finest first-person shooters I've ever played, as well as one of my favorite games of all time. The level of distinction in F.E.A.R. cannot be overstated enough, so I'll have no-holds-barred in this review when it comes to praise.
F.E.A.R. was originally released on PC in 2005, and was later re-released on Steam in 2010 alongside its expansion packs and some other bonus content not present in the original release. The success of the game's original release eventually lead to it being ported to the Xbox 360 in 2006, and to the Playstation 3 in 2007. The game also received two expansion packs after its release, and spawned an entire first-person shooter series, with the latest release being the inauspicious F.E.A.R. 3 in 2011.
F.E.A.R., named after the similarly-titled emotion (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear) is a primarily single-player FPS. However, it had a multiplayer component which unfortunately is now defunct, as Gamespy (the basis of the game's multiplayer service) was shut down in 2013, with the system's game servers going down for good on May 31, 2014. Still though, multiplayer for F.E.A.R. continues through a fan-made network of servers, based here http://www.fearcombat.org/
As you may have deduced from the game's title and the review before this point, FEAR is a first-person shooter with psychological horror elements. While the game is not very strong strictly from a horror point of view, FEAR still has a very unique and well-implemented atmosphere, and the horror aspects play a big role in what constitutes FEAR as a whole package, and are part of what makes the game such a distinctive experience.
Nevertheless, FEAR's gameplay is that of a first-person shooter, and plays entirely through a first-person perspective. There are very little if any survival horror or similar non-FPS mechanics in this game, and the use horror does not rely on making the player helpless or vulnerable as in traditional horror games. The primary purpose of FEAR's strong atmosphere is to make the player feel paranoid, as if the threat is something internalized, rather than simply an external force threatening them. To that end, the player has full control of their character throughout the entire game, and is never restricted from fighting normally. FEAR does a good job of getting under the player's skin at many points, and scenarios where the player shoots at perceived noises or things that aren't there (""jumping at shadows"", for lack of a better term) are common throughout FEAR. Even if this game doesn't scare you entirely, you'll still be treated quite a number of very neat-looking, well-designed set pieces that serve as bridges between the game's more intense shooting sections. My personal favorite is this one hallway where the ceiling starts bleeding, and the player is killed if the downwardly-expanding river of blood touches them before they reach the exit.
Perhaps the most impressive part of FEAR (besides the gameplay itself) is the very detailed use of physics and special effects in the game. FEAR is a very high-technology game, even more so given that it was released in 2005. The grand majority of games released today aren't nearly this well-detailed. Objects will react when shot or when in the midst of explosions; lighting will change when light sources are broken; and pieces of walls and cover can be damaged from gunfire, to say the least. The player's body is also present 100% of the time, in all animations, whether they're climbing a ladder, slide-kicking into an enemy, or simply looking downwards. Such a simple feature as being able to see your own body shouldn't be such an impressive feature by today's standards, but unfortunately, very many modern games have a definite lack of detail and effort put into them. FEAR is not one such title.
Now, as for the gameplay itself: FEAR is a relatively fast-paced first-person shooter, somewhere in-between an arena shooter and something like Half-Life in terms of speed. The player can hold up to three weapons, which they can switch between/swap for other weapons at any point, and they can hold a number of health packs which they can use at any point to heal, as well as a collection of throw-able explosives, including grenades and landmines. The player also has access to a neat albeit somewhat tricky to use melee system, where the player character will do a variety of martial arts moves that can very rapidly disable standard enemies. The most important mechanic in FEAR, as well as one of its main selling points is the ability of the player to slow time at will. This mechanic, aptly called ""reflex time"", is instrumental to getting through firefights successfully, and provides an excellent context for the player to notice the game's considerable amount of detail in its ballistics and decals even while fighting. Reflex time is also a great help when it comes to getting the upper hand on enemies, as the artificial intelligence in FEAR is extremely advanced. FEAR has been touted as having some of the most advanced AI in video gaming, and this is difficult to question after observing them in actual gameplay.
""Whoa."" - Keanu Reeves on FEAR
The way that FEAR relays information and backstory to the player is impressive, as well as a refreshing break from the way most modern games handle storytelling, with large exposition dumps involving poorly-developed, confusingly-motivated characters. To that end, nothing in FEAR is spoon-fed to the player, in neither gameplay nor story. If the player is interested in understanding the story, they need to listen and pay attention to various messages left behind by characters throughout the game, sort of how journal entries work in other games. Everything in this game is given an explanation or history of some sort, and there are few plot holes to be found. Aspects of the story even complement the game at large and make sense when put together with the gameplay or atmosphere, rather than serving as something useless or inconsequential. For example, the main enemies the player fights in the game are made more intelligent and more aware of what they do as on top of being clones of each other, they are also psychically linked to each other.
Psychic powers are a major theme through FEAR. The majority of the horror set pieces are caused by them, and they're the cause of the game's plot at large. The player has frequent encounters with Alma, the psychic antagonist of the game. Unfortunately though, the player is never given any psychic abilities of their own. They do, however, become a mechanic in later FEAR games, but that's another story.
Anyway, FEAR is an amazing game from all angles, and I recommend it to everyone, especially people who are looking for a challenging, intense, and unique experience compared to what most games offer. The only bad part is that you never get to kill the fat baѕtard character. Fortunately though, he appears in one of the expansion packs and the player is free to kill him there, so justice IS eventually served."

Spectacular graphics and lighting effects you hadn’t seen before its release. The storyline has been well put together, giving you indications on what is going to happen as well as the anecdotal details such as TPS Reports. I had played through it once back when it was released in ’05. I am currently playing through it again, and it still keeps me watching and waiting for those suspenseful moments.

76561198043728918,1403041761,True,"Take the linearity of Half-Life, but create a game that's actually fun and you have FEAR. Actually, this game is more linear than Half-Life, if that's even possible. It's entirely understandable if you grow tired of corridors and start to feel like you're just going down a conveyor belt with enemies ocassionaly popping out of the darkness in front of you. It's telling when even in a vehicle during the game's intro you're going down an incredibly narrow path whereby there's barely any space between the car and the walls. It's as if the developers refused to have any sort of open areas present in even the most sensible of places.

But linearity isn't bad. In fact, this game is a strong showcase of how linearity can be used to craft a strong single-player experience. While the corridors may make you feel constricted, at the same time they are conducive to brilliant enemy ai that knows its surroundings and moves accordingly. Linearity also allows a developer to craft an experience that ensures certain events are experienced a particular way and come about in proper order. Linear progression in level design means that you are strapped to a roller coaster and ride through all events in a manner that leaves no doubt in the creator's mind that you got the specific emotional ride he/she was looking to put you through.

The game is littered with many events where something 2spooky happens which is only possible through a constricted experience whereby the developer knows you are looking a particular way or going down a particular path. While getting the exact reaction out of you is only possible through linearity, it's a positive that quickly falls back down to neutral due to the negatives that weigh it down. You see, because all the 'scares' are crafted in a linear experience, you can often see them coming. It doesn't help that you get a little 'UNKNOWN SIGNAL' prompt at the top left of the screen whenever the little girl appears somewhere in the map trying to scare you. It aids in letting you know that an event is occuring and you might miss it, but that defeats the purpose of surprising/scaring you.

Not that the 'fear factor' in the game is that great anyway. Personally I wasn't frightened by the title, but it does do a fantastic job at crafting some good atmosphere. Remember: you don't actually have to succeed at scaring people to create an atmosphere that is eerie. Theres excellent use of lighting throughout and great pacing between the game's more hectic moments that leaves you wondering if a firefight is afoot or a 'jump scare'. Trying to create an FPS that is also horror-based is a tough balancing act, and this game pulled off that tight rope walk admirably. 

It's a shame that the plot itself couldn't have more meat to it. It feels a little bare-bones, with the story feeling more like justification for the little girl character and all the creepy shenanigans. It's as if they created the game and characters first, and then realized they needed a plot to tie it together; story came towards the end of development, essentially. But something tells me they had the plot down, and then got down to level creation and just kept on creating more and more until they had to stretch the already thin plot even thinner to last through the constant stream of levels. So I guess it's excusable, if not a shame. After all, gameplay comes first, even if plot is the motivator for me to keep progressing.

All said, if you don't mind linearity and a rather simple plot it's a great experience that is held up by its atmosphere and enemy ai that is carefully balanced between eerieness and enjoyable firefights."

Extraction Point: I am disappointed to the sequel of F.E.A.R. where it is so short, it is a 4-5 hour game. The pshycological expereience has just been upgrade, it is must scarier than the original base F.E.A.R. game. 8/10 notthing to be excited about, but a good sequel for the base game.

Perseus Mandate: This is on a different timeline where you play as Seargeant instead of Point Man. This game takes place the same time you see the ATC assassinate a civilian (forgot the name). I got a few scares here and there so the pshycological  horror of the game has made a great improvement. Lots of gun blazing than the other 2 games. I believe this game is better than the last 2, as it is much longer than the Extraction Point game, but a bit shorter than the base game itself. 10/10

Any FPS where you can see your own feet and shadow is legit."
76561198026723174,1401795206,True,"F.E.A.R is really fantastic.

The textures/graphics are pretty dated, but Lighting and Smoke effects actually hold up really well and cover up the blemishes.

The Enemy AI, weapon balance, weapon handling and ""horror"" elements are all equal to the best examples in modern gaming, which is both a tribute to the great people who built this game, and also exposes most modern game designers who haven't learned from it.

There is lots of ""gameyness"" in this, but it's only done for the benefit of gameplay. You can always hear enemies chatting before you see them, and when they're all dead, the music gets quiet and stops, so you always know when you should have your finger on the trigger.

Horror and action elements are kept pretty separate. Horror elements NEVER involve monster closets opening behind you (only the occation vision when you turn around), and at all points, the games plays very fair with allowing you to see enemies before they see you.

The game is very linear, but there are enough secrets that lead to either slight powerups or creepy horror visuals that there's just enough exploration to scratch that itch.

Physics are pretty basic and exaggerated, but only in a way that increases the fun. Enemies' heads and limbs really fly, but not too far.

Weapons are all useful and balanced (except maybe the crappy submachine gun) in terms of ammo capacity, accuracy, damage and availability, and chopping off heads with the laser cutter and pinning enemies to walls with the nailgun are both among the best shooting experiences across the entire genre.

The only real faults I have with F.E.A.R and and its expansions are that there's not enough environmental and enemy variety, and that the story is crappy and not very well presented. But the gameplay more than makes up for that.

Each expansion adds a couple new enemy types and a couple new guns. That means Perseus Mandate is by far the most varied gameplay-wise, but by that point, you might be a bit burned out. Main game takes around 10-14 hours to play through while each expansion is around 4-6 hours. Perseus mandate involves a different character than base game and extraction point, so after the first game, if you're feeling a bit burnt out, I'd actually recommend playing perseus first since it's better than Extraction point.

NOTE: Neither expansion is ""canon"" to the series, so if you plan on playing FEAR2, you won't miss anything by skipping them."
76561197990523893,1401780436,True,"Its a nearly decade old game thats still better than games released around these times.

Graphics, Gameplay, AI, Design, Story, Characters, Sound, this game could be released today with minimal updates and still be a competitor in the market and with minimal updates if any at all.

Unlike most AI in FPS games where they do not simulate thought, they do not do anything more than basic scripting or instantly knowing player location and other information the AI are actually responding to stimuli in the enviroment (flashlights, last known player location, last man standing) and relaying that information via verbal commands. Its very fun to run after the last man left and have him flipping out over being the last out of his small group alive. Or to peak around a corner, toss a nade, and watch the AI go into searching and attempt to flank you if your location is known. THe AI love to flank you and sneak up on you. As appose to Bioshock Infinite where the AIs most interesting tactics rely upon running directly at you or just strafing and shooting. To make a point unlike how the AI in that game don't really follow any rules, the AI in FEAR follow a set of rules that make for predictable, repeatable, and interesting scenarios because the AI can't just 360 instantly and start running around shooting. They react realistically and will attempt to gain cover or a flanking position. Predicting that a guy would come through a hallway and then blasting him is extremely pleasant and lets you use tactics back on the enemies. In Binfinite the AI is unpredictable, random, and just a mess in general. Fights don't feel good when you cannot understand and just run around shooting brainless AI until you win.  The AI arn't ""smart"" in the way some AI are and they cheat, they follow rules and respond to you. That alone is just sooo goood. 

If you like gameplay, FEAR is the type of game you need to play. Its just a classic thats not better objectively than todays games unless you value production value and flash more than actually having fun and enjoyment out of your own on screen actions. 

Its a horror game, but its not terribly scary. A few scares scared me, but nothing I would be legit scared for more than a few seconds about. The horror and pschylogical thriller are really just back drops to the great shooting and gameplay and really assist in taking you from area to area without getting bored and while making the game in general more interesting.

If you don't own FEAR on something whether that be PS3 or PC this is one of the few games you should just play. It really gives you some aspect on how todays games arn't actually made for ""Gamers"" or people who actually want to play games so much as mainstream casual sheep that wan't to be handed fun points and story and don't understand much more than go from point A to B and shoot all the guys who stand there. I can only imagine there shock when the FEAR AI would come and bring the fight behind them instead of just standing there and letting the player kill them like in todays ""Triple A"" mastershitpeices.

TL:DR
Its a fabulous game with terrific AI that dousn't drone on but stays fresh for the entire length while having designs that still trump games a decade nearly after release."

76561198020078976,1401326916,True,"This is a fantastic game. Due to always being very far behind with computer hardware, I missed F.E.A.R. when it was first released in 2005 and only played it through recently. I went in worried that F.E.A.R. would just be a generic FPS with some jump scares thrown in, but came out very pleasantly surprised. Admittedly, I thought that the game started off a bit slow, with the first level (probably deliberately) presenting itself pretty much as I described in the previous sentence, but I persevered through the first mission and it's rare that I'm this glad that I did.

In terms of gameplay, the game has very solid shooter mechanics which are extremely enjoyable. You never feel severely overpowered (maybe a little if you rely on the slow-mo reflexes ability), but you also never feel like fights are unfair. Enemies are neither damp paper nor bullet sponges so fights never drag on for too long. The main challenge in firefights is just how impressive the AI is; enemies will usually be smart enough to know when and where to take cover, even being able to move some objects to create their own cover, work together effectively by using techniques such as suppressive fire and flanking whenever possible and communicate with each other so effectively (both verbally and through their actions) that they seem like real people - so much so that there were a few points where I nearly felt bad for killing the last one in a group. One particular instance that stuck with me as the moment that sold the AI for me was when I was walking through a series of corridors with my flashlight switched on, heard a squad of replicants nearby and tried to sneak a bit loser to them while forgetting to turn my flashlight off - one of them saw the light from around the corner, yelled ""flashlight!"" and ordered another squad member to check it out, surprising me so much that I fumbled and was forced to drop my plan of getting the drop on them. Some time after that, I ended up developing a tactic of luring an enemy around a corner by flashing my flashlight at the wall and then ambushing them with my shotgun when he came to check it out, thinning out the squad just a little.

To combat this, you're given a solid array of weapons - you can hold up to three at once, which is generally a love-it-or-hate-it trope in shooters but used very effectively here. What impressed me most about the weapons is that no single weapon in the game is clearly more powerful than any other; instead, they're balanced extremely well and all very useful for different situations and playstyles (I ended up settling on a favourite set about halfway through the game - shotgun for close range, assault rifle for medium range and particle weapon for sniping - and never changing them because they fit the way I played so well). Each weapon also takes into account the weight, with heavier weapons making you move noticably slower and lighter weapons increasing your speed and making melee combat a very viable tactic - if you can get close enough, it's usually an instant kill. There are also three grenade types (standard frag, proximity mine and remote sticky mine) that are great for flushing out enemies and laying traps; I generally hate using grenades and explosive weapons in shooters because I'm terrible with them, but, in F.E.A.R., I found myself accurately lobbing grenades to flush out entrenched enemies, laying mines to catch out anyone who tried to flank me and sending enemies screaming into their squad with a sticky mine lodged on their back. Generally, F.E.A.R. favours a nearly-cover-shooter tactic - full-on assault against a squad of replicants will usually get you ripped to shreds so you need to plan carefully, look for good cover, watch your back and make good use of the lean keys to drop in and out of cover. Health is not infinite; it doesn't regenerate and the only form of healing is from medkits which you can take with you and use at will and rare health upgrades which permanently increase your health by five points. F.E.A.R. also features a ""reflex"" mechanic, which is basically an ability to temporarily slow down time (I was sceptical of this at first, but it makes sense in the context of the game's story), in which everything - enemies and your own movement speed and fire rate - slow down apart from your own turning speed, allowing you to get an aim on enemies very quickly. There were times when I felt like this made the game a bit too easy, but, because it still slows you down as much as the enemies, activating it while out of cover can still be a very foolish move, and it's always great fun to see your enemies terrified and bewildered at how fast you've suddenly started reacting to them.

As for atmosphere, as I said before, I was initially worried that the game would just be loaded with jump scares. I was very wrong; there is a bog-standard jump scare close to the beginning of the first mission, but, right after that, the game gives up pretending that it's your run-of-the-mill, ""edgy"" shooter and unrelentingly toys with you up to the very end of the game. F.E.A.R.'s scare factor relies very heavily on atmosphere - light and dark, loud and quiet. Small, unnerving noises somewhere nearby that make you edgy about turning the next corner, dimly-lit rooms that you know you have to stay in for a minute to catch part of the story but make you constantly nervous enough to be checking the doors, a ghostly figure just catching your eye as it passes by the next room. The game is [i]very[/i] aware of when you're expecting something to happen and loves nothing more than to suddenly take that tension away, then throw it right back at you when you've let your guard down. I admittedly haven't played many horror games, but I can happily say that there has been no other game so far that has made me as nervous about my surroundings as F.E.A.R. has. Monolith took heavy cues from classic Japanese horror films, the likes of The Ring and Dark Water, so anyone who has seen films like this knows a bit of what to expect in the story and presentation. The only thing I didn't like about the horror aspects were that any ""hallucinated"" characters invariably withered away into dust after they'd performed their bit, leaving you with absolutely no sense of ambiguity on whether they were really there or not. Nevertheless, even though I'm no horror junkie, the spook sections were such an enjoyable thrill that I often found myself hoping that there would be another soon.

One of the most enjoyable aspects of the game for me was that, if you want to get the whole story, you have to work for it. Almost the entire story plays out through listening to voice messages on phones and taking information from laptops that a surprising number of people left lying around and, while none are particularly hard to find, it adds a small layer of exploration into the unnerving surroundings, often requiring you to go just a little bit out of your way in an area where you really don't want to do that because you're worried that something is lurking just around that corner, or because the flashing voice message light on that phone is the only source of light in the room. It's always a rewarding experience, both for the little thrill of defying your own logic telling you not to hang around there and for adding another piece to the fascinating puzzle that is the story. I may not be the best person to comment on it - and am rather annoyed at myself - because, some time ago, I decided that I'd probably never end up playing this game and read the story to see what the game was like, and so spoiled some rather big details that I wish I hadn't, but I was still pulled enough into the story and immersed so heavily into the game that I wanted to find out every minute detail I could about what was happening.

If you love FPS and/or horror games, not giving yourself the opportunity play this would be an injustice. I could not possibly recommend this enough."

76561197982871437,1401101200,True,"Good game, but not the best shooter out there.  The scare factor was mostly from jumps until the end, when things finally got a little more sureal.  That's the thing though, it was at the end.  All the way through the middle section of the game I was wishing for new enemies or some kind of major plot point, but it never came.   There were a handful of new things along the way, but they were really just cut and paste versions of what you already fought up to that point (enemies had different colored armor and took more ammo to kill).  Regardless, it has a spark to it that has it's origins in the good ol' days of shooters.  The guns you find later are over the top and fun to use, the melee is effective and varied and while the story is a bit bland in the middle, it IS awesome by the end of the game, making me glad that I finished it.  One thing is for sure though, a lot of other new-age shooters sure could have taken a page out of this games book when it came to gunplay.  Super white hot shootouts, recoil that would keep you guessing about the next shot, damage physics and lighting that made simply pointing and shooting difficult.  All around, I liked F.E.A.R., though I won't be visiting it again.  I would recommend it to any shooter fan or horror fan that is craving a solid FPS with few flaws and great firefights."

I'm talking about optimization of code. If a game from 2005 runs at approximately 10 frames per second on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 and an AMD Vishera 8350, something is seriously wrong. It's a shame because I've heard it was a decent game. Buyer beware."
76561197980884019,1400439314,True,"While Half-Life back in 1998 hypnotized the stagnated first-person-shooter genre with groundbreaking narrative, enhanced puzzle elements, immersed atmosphere within cinematic settings and intelligent artificial intelligence, F.E.A.R. expertly continued to elevate the modern shooter in 2005, primary from an outstanding cinematic standpoint. Although essentially recapturing the spirit of creative Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo, the sci-fi classic The Matrix and terrifying The Ring remake, developer Monolith ambitiously established an intriguing original concept as well as an iconic figure no matter the various influences.

The first-rate atmosphere became apparent immediately as the newest member (that would be you) of the First Encounter Assault Recon is set to carry out a classified objective within a military task force that deals with paranormal circumstances. Apparently, a mad military commander has become a liability after taking command of a secret army of cloned soldiers that are telepathically linked to him, causing mayhem within a restricted area in an unspoken American city in order to acquire something unknown. The F.E.A.R. team along with a Delta Force unit obviously issue a respond to this threat. Strengthened by frequent voice mails and radio news reports, the twisted story of the commander and the mysterious appearance of Alma unfold engaging and dramatic.

A hectic blend of dynamic action and suspenseful horror was presented. Distinguished gun battles were downright spectacular to witness, creating stunning particle effects that in combination with the finest bursts of exciting slow-motion provided dramatically beautiful and wickedly entertaining action sequences in remarkably bloody repercussions. The lighting and shadowing model kept high class in bringing the mood, and so did the excellent music and solid voice-over. The movement patterns and animations of the enemies were well-made, but were obviously not as talked-about as their strikingly sharp artificial intelligence. Encountering these aggressive and tactically oriented opponents was challenging and incredibly unpredictable; they took advantage of the game’s physics system by knocking over objects to create cover, they fiercely reacted to your presence and actively communicated with one another. The weapons at your disposal, though only capable of carrying three at a time, were versatile, relatively equally efficient (if approached correctly) and actually dangerous, providing powerful punches to both enemies and surroundings, meaning they were implemented for a reason since you were as vulnerable as the enemy.

Although the spiritual follow-up of Half-Life came out strong on so many levels, F.E.A.R. clearly fell short on some of them. The mention of repetitive environments that basically consisted of an industrial area and an office complex could not be ignored; at times the second-rate variety made progression jaded which fuelled a negative impression that the levels lasted too long. While the atmosphere was strong and coherent, the actual horror aspect came out less effective. The imagery was certainly on several occasions unsettling, showing off a few successful jump scares, but the scare tactics became slightly familiar over time and the pattern of predictability indisputable. However, just like Doom 3 at that time, certain tension brought out from the atmosphere was consistent enough to keep you alert and that quality somewhat redeemed the mentioned predictability. While particle effects, lighting and sound were astounding, the level design and textures were less complex and kind of mediocre looking. In addition, some of the character models felt wooden and appeared like plastic dolls.

Essentially innovative and distinctly competent, F.E.A.R. elevated the modern shooter in spectacular proportions, which reasonably ended with an explosive cliff hanger. While combining action and horror, the incredibly beautiful and dynamic action portion - intensified by outstanding bullet time and amazingly clever opponents - clearly surpassed (and even to some extent neutralized) the fairly weakened horror note. Still, the unshakable lack of variety associated with the environments and level design had a significant impact on the general impression. All things considered, F.E.A.R. was and still is a skilful and relevant yet slightly jaded and overrated contribution of first-person-shooter history.

This game mixes horror, action and suspense in such a masterful way that deserves to be praised again and again. It doesn't hurt that the game has wonderful sound and design and amazing technical graphics and animation. The enemy A.I displayed here is seldom matched by any other video game so even though you can slow time down, your enemies aren't fools. They WILL try to flank and surprise you and the multi-path maps are designed to take advantage of this situation. So either you can surprise them, or they will definitely surprise you.

All in all, still an excellent, highly replayable single player game and a very entertaining yet standard multiplayer mode. If you demand heart-stopping action, this game deserves to be in your library."

76561198047038586,1399816152,True,"great gameplay with great story, must play."
76561197990805993,1399735804,True,"When I first rented Monolith Productions’ F.E.A.R. on Xbox 360 back in 2007, I was very impressed with the singleplayer campaign. Despite not being able to complete F.E.A.R. before I had to return it to the video store, it left a lasting impression on me and I considered it a modern classic. The recent inclusion of the game as part of the Humble WB Bundle provided the perfect opportunity to re-experience the game and see if my initial impression of it holds to my more refined standards of today. 

One element of F.E.A.R. that impresses more than even most newly released games is its beautiful visual effects and physics. Just about everything smaller than entire desks and tables, from office telephones and spinning desk chairs, to paintings on the walls, are physics based. Occasionally, this causes some issues (most of which exist in all games with lots of physics-based objects) such as corpses becoming embedded in walls and floors or clutter bouncing around when they should not, but for the most part lends itself greatly to the experience. It can be terrifying when you are walking down a dark hallway, trying to sneak up on an enemy, when you accidentally walk over a soda can, kicking it down the hall with a silence-breaking twang. The first time you enter a large firefight, enable SloMo, and begin exchanging fire with the Replica soldiers is breathtaking: dust fills the air as bullets impact nearby walls, creating actual holes in the walls rather than just placing a decal; stray bullets knock boxes of papers and electronics off shelves, breaking them; a grenade goes off nearby, knocking the hanging lights around, the game’s marvelous dynamic lighting and shadows changing the entire look of the battlefield; and the opposing forces’ soldiers react realistically, with custom animations dependent on where they are hit that are integrated well with ragdoll physics. Another soldier, panicking, runs away but stumbles and falls over while he attempts to call squad for backup. While these sorts of features are not a new creation for F.E.A.R., they are all used extremely effectively together to create impressive and satisfying scenes that leave a lasting impression, defining F.E.A.R. and setting it apart from other games in people’s minds.

While F.E.A.R. manages to wow with its impressive physics, lighting, and effects; intense soundtrack and Japanese-horror inspired ambience; and solid gunplay and fair difficulty, F.E.A.R. is not a perfect game and many of its elements and tropes undermine the level of immersion needed to truly be disturbed by a horror game. There are a significant amount of attempted jump scares that are ineffective and cheap feeling. The enemies, unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty, lack the power to instill a fear of death in you. Because of this playing on the hardest difficulty is an absolute must, even on a first playthrough. The highest difficulty is the only one that has fair and interesting feelings gunplay, since on lower difficulties enemies are just too weak and easy to kill. The improved gunplay and stronger enemies add both enjoyable skill-based gameplay and intense ambience that greatly improves the overall feel of the game.

Overall, F.E.A.R. is an overall great game that I would reccomend to anyone who enjoys first person games. Despite its age, it is of much higher quality than much newer first person and horror games. F.E.A.R. is a classic that everyone should experience as an important part of the history of modern gaming, regardless of your interest in the genres."

Overall I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys: Horror, Thriller and FPS."

I expected far far more from the creators of not one but two of the best FPSs on my list praised by me: Blood and Alien vs Predator 2.
The athmosphere is hell heartstopper, the weapon system is good (but with a bit of boring selection), the graphic is marvelous, though not much variety.
So why it's not a real horror game? Because 95% of the time YOU FIGHT AGAINST HUMAN BOTS!!! So much effort, so much possibilities. . .lost to boring bots. Practically this game is COD in a bloody enviroment.
Nonetheless the game is good. The AI is something astonishing. I hate AI but i appreciate this kind of reaction scale. The only level not has human bots worth the whole pain against them.

note1: Alma is cool, Fettel is not.
note2: Crates. . .Everywhere crates. This game is famous for the amount of crates it provides.

7/10 Good horror warFPS with bots and crates."
76561197966435353,1398711069,True,"It might have been a long long time since the day that FEAR. First encounter assault recon released. But man oh man, this game is up there amoungst the giants of PC fps genre.

The level design is amazing, i know this game has gotten a lot of flack for this, i always felt the levels was awesome. It fit into the environment and it made sense. Sure its a lot of office buildings and space, buts its fun interesting and help convey the story and atmosphere.

The Ai is equally amazing, sometimes it seems like the AI hasnt improved jack squat in modern FPS games, because players are gimped by controllers. The ai in this game flanks, works together, takes cover, flips over tablet to take cover behind. If you play higher difficulties you will need to use every advantage you can get. You actually have to plan ahead and use tactics.

The sound and music is also amazing, it totally fits, help to convey the dark creep atmosphere.

The game has one of the most amazing engrossing stories ive ever played, it sucks you straigh into the world. very few games can do that even to this day. and the atmosphere is so scary and thick that you can literally cut it with a knife.

I remember i got this game and i fired it up and i played this baby from beginning until end, and no its not because its a short game, i spend like 12-14 hours or something. Want an amazing journey, very few games can keep my attention like this and for that long, and after you completed it, well i just sad there, taking it all in.

The game has some expansions that are worth while playing as well.

Fear 2 and 3 is another matter. Fear 2 is a bad console port with all the restrictions limitations and dumbed down stuff you expect sadly. Fear 3 is just a piece of crap, abusing and milking the license.   

In short Fear is one of the best FPS games of all time along with HALFLIFE, but where Halflife 2 continue the excellence, They totally messed up the fear series, Its such a shame.

As a final note, im sad to see how far Monolith have fallen. FEAR and No one lives forever is two of the best FPS games i have played in my life, and i will never forget them."

76561198038255778,1398630352,True,"Playing F.E.A.R. for the second time, (first time on PC) was far more entertaining than I expected.  I bought the game originialy because of the found memories I have with it.  But I never thought that the second playthrough would be better than my first.  I played fear for the first time when I was less jaded.  At every corner this game surprised me with how well it holds up to this day.

The graphics are amazing for a game made so long ago.  The lighting in this game is still some of the best you can see.  It really makes you wonder why these guys arent making more games.  The sounds, graphics, controls are all excellent.  Im so glad I took the time to replay this title.

Hearing the hearding footsteps of enemies as they creep around a corner and catching them off guard in slow mo is some of the most satisfying gameplay you will ever experience.  There is also an illusion of level destruction that makes all the gun fights that more viscrel.  Lights sway objects and bodies fly into the air when the right amount of force is used.  I recommend this game to anyway who loves a good FPS with sci-fi/horror goodness woven in.

76561198006262032,1398410201,True,"What a hoot of a game, this long arduous descent into a ring of contemptuous shenannigans was a great example, even a good bench-mark, of game design of it's time. Nuanced observation, a fine understanding of simple gamer joys, well thought-out map sections, and a... XD ..deplorable sense of humour lead to a great first-person shooter experience. Claustrophobic and unpredictable, the game had a strange sense of 'coming up for air' all the way through it. The horror aspect was handled well and lead to some stunning situations and visuals that made for creepy times, unfortunately perhaps not really creepy enough. The game, if played right, felt like a personal conquest with one being cast as a purifying agent, an avenging angel on loan to the state, a skilled assassin with almost god-like powers and nasty guns. The labyrinthian nature of the sections have nice bottlenecks and tight gunplay is recommended. Innovations like the NPC bots making snickering jokes about seeing your torchlight in dark areas and blind firing panicking retreating enemies have enhanced the whole FPS game play mode. The background soundscapes scare my roomie =)
  Tips of the hat to Doom 3, Max Payne and the movie 'the ring' I recommend this romp for anyone interested in revisiting a grand parent of the modern video-game paradigm and taking it out for a drive.

Story was well done and weapons, enviroments and sound effects were top notch. It still remains one of my favourite games to date and set the bar really high for FPS games to follow which in my opinion have failed to do."
76561198037929519,1397897250,True,"Fear was obviously influenced by some heavy hitters like Half-Life, Resident Evil and The Matrix but manages to stand as its own unique blend.
 
 The enemy AI is superb, they will flank you if they get the chance and react to light and noise. There's a nice variety of enemy types that bring out the full potential of your arsenal which also has a wide selection. The environments are more simplistic than the AI navigating them so they often will use choke points and cover against you if given the chance. They are more confident in larger numbers and won't mind rushing at you as much. They can also panic a little before shooting at you when seeing their buddies die.

 At its core Fears game play consists mostly of pop-n-shoot cover mechanics. There are usually multiple pathways linking together the rooms your foes are and there is always an element of stealth you can take advantage of even after being spotted. There are a lot of weapons but none of them feel too much alike which makes the already satisfying combat that much more fresh.

 The bullet time is the snazziest thing you can do. You can slow the entire game down to a crawl for the duration of your remaining focus. Not only is the effect dazzling, it will keep you alive, allow you to precisely aim and minimize all the bs deaths other fps's would hand you.

[b]10 out of 10 bullet times[/b]"
76561198020436202,1397871807,True,"One of my favorite shooters of all time, and the game that desensitized me to most horror when I was a lad, FEAR is a wonderful, if not exactly groundbreaking, thriller-esque romp.  The normal points of critique are not really where FEAR excels. The graphics aren't spectacular, even for their age (though there are about a billion particle effects), character facial models look like they're made of clay.  The level design isn't particularly inspired, mostly taking place in industrial complexes or office environments.  There are generally side-paths you can take to locate goodies or flank enemies, but it isn't as open as, say, Crysis.  Bullet time is well-implemented and something of a necessity to deal with the rather intelligent enemy AI, but it's nothing new.  The horror mostly amounts to jump scares, though there are some tense moments (and disturbing ones, for the faint of heart).  The story is pretty cheesey, and is really nothing more than an excuse for the rather bizarre collection of sci-fi elements: clone supersoldiers, psychics, reflex-induced bullet time, guns that nail people to walls or roast them into charred skeletons or explode them into a fine red mist.

Oh yeah, there's those.  While the gunplay isn't stellar, the weapon selection is actually pretty enjoyable. You start off with a semi-auto pistol (which you can dual-wield), a decent SMG that you're nonetheleses going to want to ditch, and an assault rifle with a double-drum magazine. These are the boring guns. As you progress, you find a seemingly-ordinary SPAS-12 knockoff that is capable of reducing mooks to a fine red mist at point-blank range in one or two shots and is so ridiculously common and has such a massive reserve ammo capacity you'll never need to discard it, a pneumatic rifle that fires 10mm spikes, capable of ragdolling mooks on death and nailing them to any nearby surface (think the crossbow from Half-Life 2, but with a magazine and an automatic firing mode), a particle beam that reduces enemies to skeletons when they die, a tri-barrel rocket launcher like something out of Quake or Unreal Tournament, and at least half a dozen more. Each has its uses and plays really well with the bullet-time mechanic, allowing you to pretty much wreck anything you come across, provided you have the right selection, and a sharp mind.  Combine that with some kung-fu moves, and you're like an action hero.

Which is really what the game is, and why I love it. It's not some complex and deep BioWare-esque world or storyline.  It's a silly 90s action movie that, while it isn't really self-aware, nonetheless doesn't try to take itself too seriously.  You show up, blow off the heads of masked clones with your superhuman reflexes and martial prowess, and save the day from the psycho-terrorist.  Not a smart game, but nonetheless made of awesome.  If nothing else, it's a good way to kill a weekend."

76561198041817297,1397516139,True,"Best shooter on the planet ! GFX, Gameplay, Sounds.. Everything is just perfect
The lighting  shadow effects in this game are the best I've seen yet.. Here we are in 2014 and no other game has come close to this except maybe the Dead Space Series. 
GET THIS !"
76561198017624092,1397424200,True,"You want a game that includes intense firefights, a slight scent of puzzles, a nice storyline and a touch of F.E.A.R.? Well, than what are you waiting for, go get it! F.E.A.R has the perfect combination of a FPS and jumpscare/horrorgame.

In one moment you find youself fighting 10 (Doesn't sound too hard) Replica soldiers, and in the other moment you get scared until death by a little girl (No spoilers). Even thought these two things do not work very well together; Monolith worked it out. It this is probably why this game plays so well and offers you a action and horror packed storyline. 

There are quite a nice variety of guns available, with each gun having its own cons and pros. From long range to short range, laser beams to rocket launchers, ther will be something you like. (The expension encludes 1 or 2 more guns).

The A.I is still outstanding even though it was developed in 2005. The enemy will suprise you with all its tricks, like building barriers, jumping behind cover or working as a team. This can bring you in deep trouble. But don't worry, the character (Which is only known as Point Man) you play has a special abillity that lets you slow down time and gives a super fast reflexes.
You have to love having 5 enemies in front of you while beiing in slowmow, makes you a little feel like you are in Matrix.

Last but not least, the story is quite nice and has a lot of plots and turns (I still wounder why nobody wrote a book about it). 
The story more and more reviels, and things get clear and start to make sence. 

I personally recommend this game not only for its fantastic overall gameplay but also because it is a classic and a must have in your Steam library.

Challenging too and since it doesn't have the recharging health system that so many games have now you need to actually be good at it, which is nice. Was a great game when it originally came out, still is now after all these years and I highly recommend it.

Another nice thing is that it does not require a very powerful computer to run and it will work on Windows 8.1 perfectly so no compatibility issues. Controls are nice and tight too and fully rebindable. While it is older and has aged some, it still can look fairly good when the graphics settings are a maximum. Only thing is these days the MP no longer works, but the SP is more than worth it. One of the best first person shooters I have ever played."

76561197975051410,1396912885,True,"Extremely fun shooter with a unique style and some good scares!  The guns all feel as though they belong in the game, and the atmosphere, when not in a firefight, is intense.  For being made in 2005, the graphics are outstanding!  Some bland textures will be noticed, but the particle affects and fire animations are a splendid sight.

The combat is rough at first.  The player is given a slow-mo ability, ""bullet time,"" that takes a little getting used to.  Once the player has a better understanding of the AI and the use of the bullet time, things will start to get interesting, and by ""interesting"" I mean out of control!  Watching the chaos unfold in slow-motion is a lot of fun, and the ability will be VERY important in the late game fights.

The characters are all well made and the voice actors are good as well.  The game does a great job making the player feel isolated from the rest of the friendly NPCs.  It wouldn't be very scary if a team of bots came along for the ride.  Just like Gordon Freeman, the main character has no input to the events around him, which seems a bit odd considering some of the shit that unfolds.

The weapons themselves work well for the game, but they were far from my favorite part.  Apart from the pistols and a small number of other guns, almost every weapon in the game is burst fire, even the sniper rifle and rocket launcher, and that was a bit frustrating.  As the game progresses, some additional weapons, that are not burst fire, will be found: the shotgun and a type of bolt thrower are awesome.

The scary portions of the game seemed a little skewed at times, and at others, some of the best in an FPS.  Even though the use of a loud screeching sound was over-used, a lot of the spooks came from deep within -- that voice and feeling in the back of the player's mind that does not agree with what's on screen; unfortunately, the placement of these scares were a little off some times.  There were a number of scares that I missed and had to reload a section to see what happened due to a misjudgment of the player's actions.

The balance of action with tension was great.  Even if it was a mite predictable at times, there were plenty of moments that had me jumping out of my seat!  Worth every penny.

F.E.A.R.: Extraction point review below:

The follow-up dlc for F.E.A.R, aka Extraction point, picks up right where F.E.A.R. leaves off.  F1 leaves the player with an amazing ending to the game and choosing for the dlc to work as a conclusion is a grand idea!

The dlc starts out fast and wastes no time throwing the player right back into the mix; unfortunately, if the two games are played back to back, the combat can and will become extremely repetitive!  The  first two thirds of the game are top notch.  The combat is more furious than the first game, and there is no need to slowly work the player into the tension.  The cards are on the table and Alma is out of the bag --  so to speak.

Personally, the horror moments of Extraction point are better than it's predecessor's; however, like it was mentioned already, after the first half of the game or so, the horror segments and hallucinations become the only thing worth working towards.

The combat fails towards the end due to the fact that the same tactic works for the whole game!  On top of that, the longer the point man (your character) makes his way through the city, the less and less it makes sense that there has been ZERO military or police response to the numerous explosions happening though-out the subway and surround buildings.  A one man army scenario can work, Gordon Freeman, but the setting has to make sense.  Gordon was stuck in a city that was controlled by the same people attempting to kill him.  In extraction point, it just feels like the world has forgotten about you.

Lastly, there's the silent hero gig...  It worked for Gordon because he was never actually put into a situation where his lack of response didn't some how ""work"" with the dialog.  In Extraction point, the point man simply ignores the people talking to him even when it's a desperate plea for help or acknowledgment.  Friendly NPCs die because it.

If you plan on playing Extraction point, do not play it right after F1, do yourself that favor.  It's a fun and tense game, but it can be really frustrating.

What can I say?
This must be regarded as a classic and one of the finest shooters I have ever played!
The visceral, trigger finger gunplay is truely a marvel to behold. The inclusion of a bullet time dynamic really makes the carnage shine, and even by today's standards the visuals throughout the gunplay are compelling.
For me, the negative in this game must be the overall story. In this the game does feel it's age, and the final 30 minutes of the game feels somewhat rushed to it's conclusion.
Having said this, the atmosphere the game creates is pretty claustrophobic, and there are plenty of jump scare moments to keep you on your toes....and of course the all out action is second to none.
Now to move on to the expansions and further games in the series...which, if I am led to believe, should be a huge disapointment for me."

If you're looking for a cheap shooter that's exciting and tense and desperate, certainly check the game out, but don't expect anything more than that. The developers did a great job of mimicking a John Woo film with bullets ripping through walls, debris flying every which way, and soldiers getting bicycle kicked to the head in slow motion.

A big influence on the story was Japanese horror, which means a poorly treated woman with long, dark, face covering hair, and a penchant for aerobics is out for revenge by paranormal means. Horror, when done right, can be an intense thing, but it just doesn't work here. Too much time is spent making the player feel like a bad ass. When you're pulled into your first couple horror segments, there's an immediate change of tone and pace, and after a while you just want to get back into the action parts, because you can't shoot all the 'scary' things."

The games are sort of creepy, things pop out of no where, where you least expect it. The enemies are non-repetative, and the difficulty actually increases as you go along in the games themselves.

If you're interested in giving Mike a try, duct tape the hairs on the back of your neck down, turn on all the lights in your room, and get a cup of warm tea or coffee, because this game gets  super unnerving really fast. Not only does Mike get the Survivor-FPS vibe perfectly, but it also integrates bullet-time better than the original Max Payne, and has physics nearly as beautiful as Half-Life 2.

I've played it, made the stupid choice to buy the rest of the series and hated every step of the way as friends kept saying ""It gets better. It gets bettter.""

And it doesn't. It gets worse and worse as the developers released expansion packs, you later realize the story of one of them doesn't fit with the rest of the story.

It's a horror shooter but truly scary. The entire original F.E.A.R. and its expansions before Fear 2 have excellent horror scenes. The game sucks you in because of it's creepiness, walking around looking for things/paying attention to other things and suddenly a frightenting jump scene that will get your blood pumping. Sometimes the soliders creeped me out more than the girl. The sound and music also tends to amplify the scariness. There are moments when something frightening happens and  it becomes hard to just take a few steps forward and continue the game. Walking through an area which has blood splattered everywhere, dead bodies, creepy music, strange sounds, and it makes you wonder what the heck is going on. As for the shooting, it's fun, and the A.I. are fairly intelligent on higher difficulties but they also get more head shots. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who hasn't tried it.

76561197970355449,1395493932,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of the last challenging FPS games out there. The enemies don't linger in covers waiting to get shot like in mass effect 2 etc. Instead they are focused on smoking you out. You will often find your self being cornered into limited cover trying to find the time to load between kills. To make it worse, enemy AI often tries to flank you even more filling the game with intense firefights.

In the middle of F.E.A.R. is the creation and mass production of telepathic humanoidsoldiers, who obey a single telepathic leader. The project goes haywire as this telepathic leader, Fettel, learns about a few atrocities. As he has the controll of a formiable military force, he decides liquidate everyone responsible being quite effective in it. As there are way too many soldiers to be dealt with, the only sensible way to handle this is to find Fettel and eliminate him as fast as possible. 


So while the story is excentric it is believable enough. The game even jokes about your department not getting enough funding because who would take the existanse of threats like these seriosly.

F.E.A.R. has a good variety of weapon have the real feel to them. Even the basic pistol carries the necessary punch in both sound & recoil.

Voice Acting & Music fit F.E.A.R well creating the eerie atmosphere it is supposed to have.

It's an old game that has aged well and is still perfectly playable. The gameplay is good but sometimes repetitive, the strong point is the enemy AI, very good and challenging, enemies seek every moment to take advantage of the numerical superiority with efficient combat tactics. 

The plot is what is best in the game, although I have not really liked the combination of sci-fi with horror, the story is solid and well built.

It's been almost 10 years and playing FEAR is still fun. Slow-motion is imperative for survival and it does make the gameplay exciting. All the particle effects accompanying this effect still stand out, even with today's standards.

While full of action, FEAR is mainly a psychological horror. Between the action sequences supernatural encounters are common and your main antagonist is someone of that nature. Your are keen on finding out more of this phenomenon you are after and the story has some surprises for you along the way.

Extraction Point was the follow-up expansion pack for the game which takes places exactly where the main story leaves us in the original game. Interestingly, the same studio that developed this expansion pack released another one two years later. Perseus Mandate was longer, more difficult and more action-packed - too bad the story was rather unoriginal and we already new a sequel would come out. Also, the story told by Perseus Mandate is not considered canon in this franchise.

Although lacking the multiplayer component (check the message on the game's store page), FEAR's single player content is still very original and can be entertaining in 2014. I recommend it to all people who adore the FPS genre."

It was one of the best games in it's day, and for those who are nostalgic it still is worth rebooting it. I played through this again recently and with newer hardware it still looks good. I played on my Mac Pro with GTX 680 on 2560x1440 and the game scales nicely. The textures do not stretch and render at 2,5K, this is because they made games back then which render resolutions dynamically.

The expansions offer the same support except for Extraction Point, but you can make it work with some modding. There's a guide in the Community for this.

Steam says Multiplayer isn't supported anymore, but it still works. Altough you will have to gather friends to play it, but if you're lucky enough to have enough friends who would want to play again I would suggest you just plan a saturday LAN day for it. This is alway more fun and since recent games don't support LAN as much anymore depending on which game you check the whole nostalgia feeling will be complete this way."

76561198040593028,1393705999,True,"Discovered soon to be a great game. Very enjoyable, not many FPS like this around.

[Goodies]
- Spooky in an smart way
- Great Hardcore Gameplay and Action moves
- Does not really have a ""storyline"", but does have story.
 ( We start to be aware of it together with the gameplay feelings and events)
- There is no destinction, but we can play more Tactical or Agressive.
- Graphics: Old game? you will forget that soon.. Its graphics still kick butts!
- Sound: They're just awesome. They multiply the spooky-factor and actively change our gameplay.
( you can listen to enemies going coward or motived over killing you; ..and i love the ""...f##k.."" when they realize they cant escape a well placed granade )

[So so]
Music: Its not awesome nor bad, but serves its porpuse well.

PlayTime: 22 hours (enjoying the game, exploring every corner.. screeshoting the gore and playing football with enemy heads)
Score: 8 / 10

--------------------------------------
Extration Point Expansion
--------------------------------------

[Goodie]
This expansion starts right where the main game ended. After all that kickass and explosions our mission is to get the hell outta this mess! We soon discover our greatest enemy is not gone.

Things that changed:
Some things will change a bit, like the introduction of mini-turrets but it remains mostly the same.

[So So]
Story: I found this expansion lacking a little more story elements, still advise to play if you dont want to miss a thing :)

PlayTime: 8 hours (enjoying the game, getting scared like a little girl.. screeshoting the gore and cleaning my pants multiple times)
Score: 7 / 10

--------------------------------------
Perseus Mandate Expansion
--------------------------------------
We are assigned to a new mission that.. has everything to do with our character. 

[Goodie]
Almost as big as the main FEAR.. hurray!
Story: It gets back the story details, and doesnt seem a little forced anymore, unlike the 1st expansion.
Bonus missions: We get some short bonus missions/challenges that are also fun to play. I said fun.. not easy hehe.

PlayTime: 16 hours (enjoying the game, being picky about how to blow enemies up, and struggling for my life at the end of the game)

76561197983841339,1393654943,True,"F.E.A.R. is a fantastic game and has aged gracefully over the last 10 years. I only played a little when it first came out, so this isn't a nostalgia-goggles review. 

I'm not sure this would count as horror exactly, it's more Sci-Fi FPS than horror, which is a relief to me because I scare easy. The horror elements are there, but are generally predictable and easy to handle if your tolerance for blood is decent. The scariest thing about this game is how GREAT the AI is. I don't know how many times I jumped out of my seat when a bad guy popped around the corner before I expected one to. 

Gameplay reminded me a lot of Half-Life 1 bits, with its giant hallway-style levels, unique weapons, and dark motif. The slow-mo mechanic makes gunplay way more fun and methodical than most run-of-the-mill FPS's. Pump up the difficulty on this if you want a challenge, though. Normal mode gives you enough healthpacks to bury you with."

For one thing I was never intimidated or scared by F.E.A.R. 3, but F.E.A.R. was very scary (at one point I actually didn't want to play it because of how scared I was). F.E.A.R. 3 was interesting but I wasn't as immersed within the plot as compared to this game. The gameplay in F.E.A.R. 3 was fun but in the original installment it is a lot more fast-paced without using slow-mo.

The game is also scary, with some excellently paced and crafted horror mixed into the high octane action gunfights.  Atmospheric dynamic lighting and powerful audio design create a sense of tension and dread.  The biggest criticism of the game is that the environments are repetitive, but honestly I prefer it to the sequels ADD approach throwing you into a new environment every hour or so.  Buy it.
"
76561197989485350,1393065354,True,"One of my favorite all time FPS games. F.E.A.R. is a truly great experience. The level design for it is pretty good, but what makes the game so intense is how the lighting is. The darkness and shadows in this game create an atmosphere that puts you on the edge of your seat and gets your pulse going. 

Combat is not bad, not much to say other than the slowmo was (kind of) nice although I found it more fun to go without it except when I wanted to feel like a badass with explosions going off and bullets narrowly flying past me. The AI is definitely smarter than most I've seen too. 

Alma is great and her appearances make this game just creepy. It's a shame most FPS games don't feel this fluid. All in all the only thing that really bugged me is that this game has issues with certain keyboards and mice which causes severe lag and input delay, but after screwing with the settings, it runs like a charm.

8/10"
76561198002820681,1393028543,True,"FEAR tries to be different to normal FPS games by trying to be add a horror/psycological aspect to it. Whilst the sections where you encounter Alma Wade are sometimes creepy, it doesn't vindicate it to be a scary game, especially when the majority of the game is just shooting people in low light areas. Plus when you are dual wielding pistols, or carassing a combat shotgun, during the psycological sequences you never feel in any danger and defeats the point.

The story is generic, I lost interest in it quickly and I have forgotten most of it. The FPS aspects are solid, usual gun roster, varied grenades and the slow-mo great but a little over powered. There is no auto health regen, which was the main reason for me getting tense during this game, yet you can have 10 health packs in your inventory which again slightly ruins it.

To sum it up the game was an enjoyable FPS, gameplay solid, story stupid, graphics don't seem dated , sound and music great so 6/10. Also Nortan Mapes can go [spoiler]fuck[/spoiler] himself."

I'm not really a fan of the horror genre, let alone Japanese-themed horror T_T, but something about this game that makes it one of my all-time favorite shooters.

You play as the Point Man, a F.E.A.R. operative, sent to eliminate a group of super soldiers (replicas) and their leader, Paxton Fettel. You'd soon uncover that it was more than just a mission, it was a date with destiny.

I loved the concept of the story, but in my opinion, fell short on the story-telling factor. There were times that felt like fillers just to make the game seem longer and some times where I was confused at who was who. Even with all that, the story is pretty solid for an FPS.

The visuals are a bit dated today, but they did a damn good job at that time. The game doesn't rely on jumpscares to freak people out, but the way they build up the tension e.g. flickering lights, suspense music, things moving on their own etc. basically things that'll make your hair stand on edge, and the game did it well.

The gameplay in F.E.A.R. is honestly one of the funnest experience I've had in First-Person Shooters. Think Half-Life meets Max Payne with awesome ragdoll physics. The Slow-Mo ability partnered with the shotgun can be OP at times, but I'm not complaining :D I also love that it has a health bar, collectibles to upgrade your health and reflexes, and medkits which you can use to heal yourself at will. 

Overall Experience: I love this game so much and is my favorite in the franchise. Plus, the ending is just awesome and will leave you wanting more. After beating the entire trilogy, I was kinda disappointed that the 3rd one took on a more generic approach. This game ironically managed to make me tolerate horror games, with the exception of Amnesia, Slender, Outlast and basically horror games that leave you defenseless T_T"

76561198007503338,1392436141,True,fear more like steer... clear of this game
76561198002371019,1392414257,True,"This actually is a really great value. Not only does it have the first game, but it also has both expansions as well. Weird, as they don't really advertise it that well.

Storywise, I would say that the original and Perseus Mandate are the best. They have a good mystery, high stakes, but no characters you can really get invested in. Armacham Corporation tried to make military clones, their psycic (and psycotic) leader went rogue and now you have to clean up the mess. Then it turns out the leader, Paxton Fettel, is looking for something. Then he finds it, and HOLY CRAP WHAT THE F*** IS THAT AND WHY IS IT EATING MY SOUL? 

If I said anything more, that would be spoiling it.

Backing up the story are the scares and the gunplay. The gunplay is, at its core, a very good tactical shooter, with bullet time stapled on. The reloads are way too fast in my opinion, but the marital arts moves and ability to watch grenades explode when they hit enemies in slow motion more than makes up for it. The weapons start off standard. Pistols. SMGs. Shotguns. Assault rifles. Oh! Dual pistols! Now I can pretend to be the hero in a John Woo film! Then, at around the second or third level, you find my personal favorite: The Penetrator. It is a weapon that staples enemies to walls. However, if that doesn't interest you, there's the 15-round rocket launcher that fires in 3-round bursts. Or the MP-50 repeating cannon. Or a laser that literally strips the flesch from an enemy's bones. The expansions have even more weapons that can get even more creative.

After that, you might have to ask ""If it has all those weapons, how can it be scary? Scripted jump scares?"" Well, there are some of those, and they are actually kind of good because they're combined with the right atmosphere. However, they don't just rely on those. Some of the enemies are actually pretty frightening, like these ghosts that drag you into hell and eat you alive. Then there are the sequences where the walls fly away to reveal new walls. Then monsters are everywhere. Then, you're falling into darkness. When you wake up, the villian has you locked in solitary. Or there's the scene that makes you afraid of ladders for all time. Even if you aren some kind of unscareable badass, you'll have to admit at the end that they did try.

There is some stuff that's kind of bad about the game. The art direction was horrible. I mean, look at the screen shots! Even when it first came out, I was never impressed by the graphics. Also, as its so old, sometimes you need to give it some help to get it running. However, it is all definitely worth it."

F.E.A.R. manages to provide consistent and strategic challenge throughout its chilling sense of dread. While playing it seemed like at any moment that horrid little girl could just pop out and murder me, which added a sense of real tension as I went through the standard action scenes. F.E.A.R. is the epitome of a horror-shooter done right. Its an actually good shooter that happens to be really fucking scary. The AI is extremely well adept and seems to always come up with new tatics and manuevers to up the ante. I found myself enjoying the combat sequences just as much as i dreaded the jump scares. Solid mechanics, AI, Weapon varieties, and Suspence. A true classic for all fps/horror gamers."

First Encounter Assault Recon is one of the most original FPS games ever made, and ranks right up there with Timesplitters and Half-Life on my list of best FPS games. The action is intense, the gore is satisfying, the story is superb.

This game managed to put in enough action that you can forget it's a horror game, and that's why it's scary, you are apt to let your guard down and that is when the scares really get you.

The game is fun and, rarely for a FPS, actually has replay value. I would recommend it to anybody. A true classic.

The only downside is that the multiplayer is no longer active, which disappoints me to no end.

As a [i]horror[/i]-shooter though, the game falls a bit flat.

The story isn't much to write home about either. There is a nice twist, but unfortunately you're practically told it at the end of the first mission so all of the build up feels a bit wasted. The characters are never really developed either, so when they die, it really seems hard to care.

It's modern version of Doom but with less interesting enemies, guns and one of the worst level designs in the history of FPS. Sad case from Monolith who also provided the best FPS, No One Lives Forever. The plus side is that occasionally the game looks good even by todays standards.

The game is a mix of horror and fps the story revolves around a technology corporation conducting some experiments involving super soldiers I wont spoil it too much but I never knew little girls could be so scary :O

Great atmosphere along with some nice guns, my criticisms with the game is I wish there was a way to carry more than 3 weapons and perhaps more enemy variety as it was I found the mini bosses and gun fights quite easy and a little repetitive.Even though repetitive I just loved the constant stream of enemy and the AI how the soldiers went for cover then leaned out to get a better shot of me, not to mention when they are hurt they seem to retreat by limping backwards.

If theres one thing I must add is the game and its expansions really do have great atmosphere I've played scary games before and this is up there with ""jump in your seat"" moments the last time i was this scared about walking around a corridor was when i completed system shock 2 back in the day!

I really do recommend picking it up a nice time passer with some fun moments and one very creepy little girl!"
76561198026346723,1391615044,True,"A uniquely eerie experience of horror and rampaging violence.

F.E.A.R. is one of the best games ever made. Back in 2005, this game set the benchmark for high-end graphics and performance (I remember saving up my money from lawn mowing as a teen just so I could afford a $300 graphics card to play this one and only game, only to find out that I then needed a new CPU). Yes, at the time, F.E.A.R. was one truly ambitious beast. And for all of its ambitions, I believe it succeeded and even set the bar in some areas that have hardly been matched by anything in the gaming industry since.

The story might be a little ridiculous, but horror stories usually are. A little girl named Alma with abnormal abilities was horribly wronged years ago by Armacham corporation and so she is back from the dead and exacting her revenge on these people through her own horrifying supernatural powers as well as using Paxton Fettel (one of her sons). Fettel telepathically controls soldiers (Replica) of which you will spend a big duration of your time fighting throughout the story as you (a F.E.A.R. operative) investigate and try to suppress these supernatural happenings.

No, this not a game where you have a squad of guys to help you. This is horror. You are on your own. Not many games make you feel truly alone in the dark and fighting for your life quite like F.E.A.R. does and this is all thanks to several factors: the darkness, sounds, the masterfully grim soundtrack, dream sequences (you'll see what I mean). The settings are empty warehouses, empty office buildings, empty science facilities, all complete with gratuitous amounts of blood and dead bodies. You navigate your way through each interval with the constant gloomy ambience and the sounds of true silence. That is until you meet the Replica forces or when you start having nightmare sequences as reality comes back and puts you at another door. Sure the environments can get repetitive (as was one major gripe with the game people had back then), but this little complaint is overshadowed by that fear that something terrible is around the corner. The game does what a true horror game should and that is that it provides a dark, foreboding atmosphere that can leave you in the clutches of fear, and then it also has some jump scares (which seem to be the only ""horror"" element of today's games like Resident Evil 6 and Dead Space 3).

The firefights. Ah, the violence in this game is top-notch. It is bloodier than anything that came out in 2005 and the fights sure do escalate quickly (think Hotline Miami). Also, not only were the graphics praised as one of F.E.A.R.'s highlights, but the AI was as well. I will go on record to say that F.E.A.R.'s AI IS BETTER THAN 95% OF ANY SHOOTER SINCE 2005, even today as I write this much delayed review in the beginning of 2014. No other game had me more paranoid for where each enemy was at or where they were headed than this work of art. The Replica soldiers will not only take cover and pop up to shoot, but they will advance, throw grenades, and even go around obstacles to come up behind you. 

It is quite an achievement for F.E.A.R. to have such intelligent AI that still plays as if it was developed yesterday. On the other hand, it is very sad that the games today still offer the same single player gunfights of computer enemies taking cover, popping up to shoot, maybe tossing a frag, repeat. It seems no progress has been made in developing thinking, reasoning computer-controlled enemies as F.E.A.R.'s vicious soldiers for today's FPS games, and this was almost a decade ago. But I digress. The AI is very smart and it does more than your typical Far Cry 3, Battlefield 3, Call of Duty simplistic copy and paste enemies do (and yes, I have played these other games and enjoyed them too).

Admittedly, playing this years later again, it does seem dated. The visuals are not the benchmark anymore and the scares can feel predictable now. But of course, this is only to be expected for a game as old as this, so really this is nothing to fear.

So overall, F.E.A.R. is a very unique and overwhelmingly satisfying shooter/horror experience that you do not want to miss (and if you like it so much, check out its EPs, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate). In my opinion, the graphics still hold their charm (but this could be the nostalgia talking), but some may be put off by the old visuals in this graphics-demanding world. Oh well, F.E.A.R. is not for them. No, F.E.A.R. is a demanding game that will give you a good challenge while also throwing you through a rollercoaster ride of thrills. From the terror of wandering in the dark and listening to story-related voicemails in an empty, bloody office cubicle to the frights of seeing Alma as angry as the angel of death-F.E.A.R. delivers!

76561197996148869,1391528229,True,"Nice horror action game, the graphics are decent seeing that this is a really old game and the story is good but the enemy and weapons are few and it gets a bit repititive but the ai is compensates a bit, overall F.E.A.R. is a decent horror game with good gameplay mechanics and designs and a ton of jump scares!"
76561198065716161,1391456412,True,"So you want a game that balances creepily quiet moments with intense firefights, you found it. Just the balance between the two is amazing, unlike F.E.A.R 3 & F.E.A.R 2, it's not all about shooting and killing. I will admit the game has some amazing jump scares, and when I started playing it, I couldn't stop. While going threw the game your constantly looking for med kits and ammo, which makes it so much more tense on you, but also a lot more enjoyable. The graphics are something to look at for its year, but even if it did look like shit, the enemy AI is amazing. The enemies work together to combat all of your strategies, and hard mode offers quite a challenge. I world recommend this game to anyone, it easily made my top ten, and I'm sure it's also on many others."
76561198050587295,1391368796,True,"QUICK SUMMARY
Nice fun game. Not the prettiest to look at, but fun from start to finish. Some of the most amazing AI ever created. Probably worth $5 at most.

GRAPHICS 3/5
The game is from 2005 and it shows. However I believe they have aged well, especially if you crank up all the feature to the max, since it never really becomes bothersome, although a bit repetitive on it's color plate. Even when it was originally released, graphics where never meant to take the forefront though, so don't expect a big 2005 showcase. They are simply OK.

STORY 2/5
Again, for the time, mixing horror with military FPS was a bit of an inovation. The story also simply serves the bigger game picture, providing a good excuse to mow down clone soldiers, get a scare or two out of the player, and come up with some weird scenarios. However, you can't help but feel the story never reaches it's full potential, being content with only feeding you bits here and there. Even worse, a good chunk of explanations are left to audio recordings which are barely audible and force you to simply stand and listen when you are all pumped up and want to continue.

MUSIC AND SOUND 2/5
Not much music to talk about. It's creepy and barely noticible. Never stands out but subtly sets the atmosphere for either creepiness or action. Sounds simply fitts as it should, guns sound the way guns doo and some shrieks here and there can be chilling to the bone (but only the first couple of times). 

GAMEPLAY 4/5
If anything, this is where the game shines the most. The controls are tight and the actual shooting is as satisying as shooting could be. The graphics, sound effects, animation and everything in general come nicely together so every shoot has the appropiate punch behind it. There's some good weapon variety and destructible stuff littered around to make firefights more flashy. AI is one of the best I've ever seen for a game though, and was years beyonf it's time. Enemies coordinate, use actual attack tactics and react as a human player would. So good is the AI that even at the lowest difficulty level, where enemies are weaker, have poor aiming and you can apparently take more damage, you can STILL be surprised by the AI and die.

REPLAYABILITY 1/5
Not much to do once you beat it except trying to do it again at a higher difficulty level. I'm not much for multiplayer so once I finished it I didn't touch it again."
76561198007496648,1391250770,True,Really great game!! 100% recomended!
76561198024478670,1391042922,True,"Given where FPS games are todat, FEAR is a nice refreshing dip into what used to make FPS games so good. With the original 10 hr campaign plus both expansion packs, you get your moneys worth with this game.

Pros:

+Challenging AI: The enemy soldiers won't just stand around and wait for you to play dentist and fill their teeth with lead, they'll come to you and try to bash yer fokin 'ed in m8. Plus, they are extremely accurate, even on Moderate difficulty.
+Good and Scary bits: Sometimes you'll have a vision on a genuienly spooky Silent-Hill esqe room which can definitely creep you out, and Alma appearing around corners or as soon as you climb a ladder can give you goosebumps or make you cry out and make your family wonder what exactly you're playing...
+Lengthy Campaign: Like I mentioned earlier, the story is around 10 hours long (or maybe I'm just bad) and has some challenging areas that require you to do some thinking to advance to the next area.

Cons:

-Not very ""survival horror-y"": I was hard pressed to find a moment in the game where I wasen't completely over-saturated with health kits and extra ammo (which is saying a lot since you can carry up to 10 spare med kits), which can take away from a lot of the horror since there isn't much of a scare of the player dying, just seeing something scary.
-Story falls apart at the end: Little spoiler alert here, Alma is referred to several times as a ""powerful psychic being"". But that doesn't really explain how she start calling forth GHOSTS toward the end of the game. Perhaps this is explained in a sequal, perhaps not. But there just isn't a lot of clarity on how she or the other villian have power that are completely non psychic related

But these are just a few water marks on this shining, beautiful window of a game. And as long as you stand at a healthy length, you won't even notice those water marks anyway.

*Non-analogy version*: Game iz gud, bai it."
76561197981721174,1390887175,True,"I have to say that this one of the most ""episodic"" f-p-shooters around. If you have all the expanions bought it is a real deal. Most games dont ""startle"" me but this one does and the way the evnironment is continually manipuated gets me everytime. Graphics are graphics (2005). I wish there was more ""hope/light"" for those character who were involved. If you are looking to kill some time and enjoy suspense buy it. You will not regret it. The game seems to never end....."
76561197992767219,1390871566,False,"Picked this up last year sometime in a bundle. Cannot get it to work on my PC even on medium settings. For comparison's sake, the newest game I've got while writing this is Assassin's Creed 4 which plays fine with most of the settings maxed out. Perhaps there is a fix of some sort out there but for the moment it hardly seems worth the effort and I figure it's something people should be aware of. Won't post full specs here but graphics card is GeForce GTX 660 Ti, though obviously anything constructed after 2006 should probably be able to handle this game."
76561197996334475,1390868765,True,"F.E.A.R.'S muddy graphics, cheesy derivative horror theme and abysmally monotonous level design, make a poor first impression, but that should not deter fans of fast-paced shooters.  F.E.A.R.'s appeal is its fast and intelligent enemy A.I.s, which consistently pressure players to make dynamic use of the game space, arsenal and a franchise-signature ability to slow down time.  

Over time, F.E.A.R.'s lack of diversity in both its gameplay and its environments begins to wear, and boredom creeps in.  But the game is nonetheless a welcome break from the oppressive glut of static and uninspired, albeit visually impressive military shooters.

TECHNICAL ISSUE:  I should note that users of Logitech Keyboards and Mice report severe performance issues.  The problem is solved by disabling a few devices in the control panel, but it is a pain."

76561197970731100,1390846805,True,"One of my favorite FPS games that I have ever played. It is a horror game, so expect a lot of gore, creepy moments, and jumpscares. The combat in this game feels and looks amazing. You have a slow motion ability that gives you the edge on your enemies. It makes the gunfights look very cool when you have bullets whizzing by your head and you are running up to things to deliver a shotgun blast into them and they explode into pieces. The grenade effects are one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in a game. When they explode (especially in slow motion), the particle effects from the blast look awesome. Try throwing them in a group of enemies with lots of destroyable objects around them and watch the eye candy.

The A.I. in this game is one of the best ever created. Your opponents will be constantly calling out different tactics to deal with you and then executing them in the middle of a gunfight with you. They constantly try to flank you, send multiple formations at you, throw grenades at you behind cover, and lots of other methods. Good thing you have that slow motion ability to deal with them. 

The only negative thing I can say about this game is that it is a corridor shooter. You run through a lot of enclosed areas and a most of them are the same thing over and over while going through the storyline. The 'scary' moments are a hit or miss for people. I think it did a great job for the time that it came out in delivering a scary experience. Even after playing through the game multiple times, that 'ladder scene' still gets me every single time!

The main game is about 8 hours long, depending on how much you explore and listen to the audio recordings scattered throughout the levels. The Extraction Point DLC is worth getting too. It's about a 4 hour long DLC, that continues where this game left off. It still has all the great elements that made the main game so good. The only other thing I will say about it is, Holiday didn't deserve that :( Avoid the other DLC. It's terrible."

A prominent gameplay element is ""reflex time"", which slows down the game world while still allowing the player to aim and react at normal speeds. As the player progresses through the game they will be able to pick up shots that will increase the amount of health, and reflex time they have."

Extraction Point was a good expansion(a DLC to all you young punks), with the same awesome combat, weapons, and enemies. In my opinion this was much scarier than the main game was. 8.5

It is by heart a corridor shooter but level design is good enough as to not make it boring. There are a limited amount of environments and it obvious inspired by the first Half-Life at places. Graphics are surprisingly pleasing for a game approaching a decade old and enemy A.I. is challenging and highly satisfying. I guess I'm a little spoiled by todays destructible environments as I did find the environment a little static at times and not always predictable. It took me around 11 hours to complete and I felt the length was sufficient  but you could argue that it is a bit on the short end."

76561197994318926,1389344052,True,"This is a game where Kung-Fu kicking an enemy is a legitimate way to take them down.  The DLC is wonderful, I never thought surgically using a laser rifle to cut body parts from an enemie's body in slow motion could be so satisfying."

76561198016655402,1389231062,True,"I played this game almost 5 years ago clocking around 20 hours on it, so I decided to buy it again on steam and still manage to have fun playing it  and be vulnerable to those jump scares! This game has a great story line, combat and spooky/creepy moments that will make you quit the game (if you can't handle it). The guns that can be obtained are brutal like my favourite, the nail gun, which will stick an enemy to a wall or close object. It's a fantastic game! Howver, don't be put off by how old it is, you'll forget about that once you get into it! 8/10."
76561198010147104,1389220255,True,"An amazing game.  Especially for the current price and its additions.  HIgh end graphics cards will really chew this up, and they may even pose an issue getting it to run.  Graphics are starting to looking dated, but are decent none the less, gameplay is spot on and the story is amazing.  However, compared to some of the newer horror genre games, it is not as scary as it once was.  Still good for the occasional jump though.  BTW, the multiplayer component was never that great, and has never been well supported, you wont miss it.

FYI...i had some issue with freezing and such, as i stayed above, but i have a higher end PC and keyboard/mouse.  If you've tried everything, and nothing works, try shutting down some of your HID.  Some boards and mice have so many functions the game doesnt know what to do."

76561198119636344,1389156618,True,"F.E.A.R is a fun ride. The pacing of the game is pretty good but repetative in places. Nevertheless, it's an accomplished shooter with some really quite decent A.I who will flank you when they can. Mastering the 'lean' is advisable as it keeps you mostly in cover and can really save you at times.

The weapon set is not too big but is quite varied. Only being able to carry three weapons at a time (explosives not included) the game encourages you to make a tactical selecton that suits you best. The game supplies you with health, armour and ammo enough to keep the pace of the game flowing nicely. 

But what about the scare factor i hear you say; well, for the most part it's just very eerie and there are some very creepy sequences early on. As the game progresses it gets a little more tense, but at times i feel the game wants you to feel scared so much it acctually detracts from the horror. That said however there are some genuine jump scare moments where ive just fired wildly in the general direction of what scared me and had a few minature heart attacks.

If you like FPS games this one's for you; the weapon design is well done, the shooting feels satisfying and theres lots of blood and ever dismemberment with a well placed grenade. If you're only after the horror or scary element defenatly consider it but its more a good shooter than a survival horror game so don't expect too much on that front. All in all i'd give this a very high 7/10."
76561198050836278,1389129750,True,If you want horror then F.E.A.R. is here for you... Although I played this at 2013 I can say it gives you a truly experience of action and terror you cannot easily find in games today... Great atmoshere and a quite nice story make this game worth the price... Play it and see how the real paranormal activity should be (btw the movies suck ) But the game rocks !!! :)
76561198030217555,1389127498,True,"The AI is tough, in that the soldiers will actively move around and try to kill you. In addition the main character is not too much of a super hero yet so you have roughly the same hitpoints as the soldiers you kill. It's fun, it's creepy, it's FEAR. The main game will run you 7-10 hours, EP 1 about 5 and I have not gone though EP 2 yet. 

The expansions are deemed Noncanon by the company that went on to make Fear 2 and 3; Characters that die in the expansions continue to appear in the series. Though I was told if I ignore the deathes for the most part the expansions still apply. 

Alma. That is the name of the creepy girl that you will see often throughout the series. Like any rage-stricken ghost her motives in the first game are completely nonsensical. Sometimes she kills good guys, sometimes badguys. Sometimes she makes things worse, sometimes better. Some times she wants to protect you, the next thing you know specters are trying to rip out your intenstines. In the first expansion pack she even seemed to be temporarily at peace after bombarding the player with hellish visions, what triggered the peace still confuses me as all the player does is traverse to the other side of a morgue. 

I only have two complaints. Complaint one is: There is no contractor in the world good enough at his job not getting fired for the monstrocity that is the floor planning of every single building in Auburn. Kitchens become bathrooms become dining halls become maturnity wards and suddenly you may even drop into a sewer or elevator. This often left me disjointed and confused in terms of what direction I should be going even though I never seemed to get stuck enough to warrant a walkthrough. FEAR Obeys 90's shooter laws. Climbing into Vents is often a brilliant and eerily safe idea, side rooms typically have loot, and red valves are usable. 

Second complaint. It's hinted throughout the game that the Point Man is more or less safe from Alma's outbursts. Of course she can and will kill you a few times but she has her reasons. But this seriously undermines her presence after completing FEAR and moving on to the first expansion.  The second expansion and Fear 2 have a different protagonist so this is more of a gripe about expansion 1's design."
76561198009899165,1389011264,False,"Shit's not scary, yo. If you liked Doom 3, F.E.A.R is about halfway there... Hardly a glowing recommendation."
76561197994473054,1388998530,True,"Let me start off by saying I passed on this game years ago due to fact that I do not like scary games. That was a mistake.

Fear is a really well put together FPS with 15 percent horror. It trys to scare you in places. Most of the time it does not work, but it adds to the overall game experience. The story is a bit all over the place but it is differnt in a good way. I find my self looking for recorded phone messages in the game to find out more. The shooting is fantastic and the enemy AI is very smart. Instead of waiting for you to make a move the AI will try to flank you or lock down a hallway. The lighting in this game really sells it. It adds a spooky feeling and makes for a better game. The sound and music is amazing. This game is really good at creating a mood and keeping you on the egde of your seat. 

That being said there are some down points. To often did I find myself overflowing with health kits or having none. There wasnt an even flow. The game had 2 modes. Its like heres story time now heres action time. They dont meld together very often. The game also uses set pieces. IE a character looking at you through a window. But a lot of the time I wasnt looking at that window. So i missed it only to know I missed it because of a music cue. 

Overall this game is a jem in the sea of FPS! Very differnt and very refreshing. I recommend you pick it up.

Great graphics for a game that was released in 2005 that still look gorgeous today with great dynamic light, something that even today some games struggle to do well. Very good gameplay with maybe the best Bullet Time system(apart from Max Payne) ever done, and great A.I making the battles between enemies very intense and challenging. 
A very well executed story without too many cutscenes, that keeps you interested until the end, and a somewhat a good level design that can be sometimes a little bit repetitive because it seems you´re always stuck in the same place.

76561198027595240,1388665231,True,"""WOW!"" - Me after playing an hour of F.E.A.R

I was suprised to have enjoyed this game a lot. It was scary but not predictable, action-packed but not COD, story-centered but not a 4-hour-long cutscene. Got this on the humble bundle along with the other 2 sequels and having gotten half-way through the second game, I'd say the first one is actually far more fun.

Totally recommended by me, an awesome game.
Gameplay: 8/10
Story: 6/10
Scares: 7/10"
76561198002466839,1388664930,True,"Should i add more on it,lots of scary moment,FPS experience.Definitively a Classic!

8.5/10"
76561197968746976,1388629106,True,Still scares the crap out of me even after having played in from start to finish plenty of times.
76561198056971046,1388595630,True,"Like some have said before me, F.E.A.R. stands out in my mind much like the Half-life series. Granted there should be certain expectations going into this game series - The two first and foremost being that your enjoy FPS games and like the idea of a horror/sci-fi twist to them. Since well, those are the two main elements to the games, especially in the first (and argubly the best) game. You will either a) Be shooting at bad guys with guns, stormtrooper types, that sometimes consist of tougher enemies like Mechs or b) You will be putting up with creepy and horror-esque paranormal events - usually in the form of Alma who of course you learn about as you progress.

Now, if that sounds appealing to you; then odds are you will like FEAR. Dealing with Canon/Non-canon b.s. aside, all of the renditions of FEAR have at the bare minmium been decent in my opinion. However because of this Canon/Non-canon bull, things do get confusing if you care about the story at all.

Both the expansions for the first game are considered Non-canon. Extraction Point being the one that clearly is, though oddly enough is the one with more favorable reviews. Perseus Mandate seems to get less love, though honestly I view both of the expansions as one in the same - they simply add ""what ifs"" and more FEAR gameplay, if you like that idea then you probably won't mind the expansions.

I will say this though - FEAR is by no means the ""scariest"" game ever, it has scares much like you would expect in horror movies - and a lot of the panic or spooky moments are built around the linear game design. You are pretty much being led along, killing bad guys or avoiding/putting up creepy shit as you go. There are moments where you can divert from the main path, which usually involves some sort of paranormal sighting in order to get an easter egg; be it an item like the health/reflex boosts (which you want btw), or a rare weapon or even just one of the many phone messages left in the game.

All in all, if you like FPS games with healthy dose of sci-fi and horror - then by all means pick this game up(and maybe the series)."
76561197975739166,1388590454,True,Enjoyed this DLC addon. It's as long as the first game and was really good value for money. Some real heartstopping moments and parts where I jumped out of my seat. Great franchise; game won't disappoint.
76561198031677050,1388568327,True,"I enjoyed the 2nd one more in terms of combat and age.  Some things didn't feel right here like the length of the game (should've been about 2 levels/hours shorter) and no waypoint or communication meant getting sidetracked a lot.  I also thought the 2nd one was scarier.  Enjoyed the ending and if I had paid more attention, the storyline seems like it's probably good too..."
76561198043451118,1388564527,True,"Fear is an amazing trilogy, and I enjoyed it greatly. The combat system was rather epic, and the bullet time helped in many situations. Alma is amazing she is the most BA thing in there, if you touch her you die."
76561197964783082,1388543054,True,"Another classic FPS, still holding it's own today and well worth a purchase for the asking price."
76561198027672885,1388533957,True,"F.E.A.R.'s atmosphere is unlike any game you've played before. Providing you with exceptional sound and level design, along with a story that is entertaining and gameplay that proves challenging but fun. This is a game you won't want to miss and one you will stand by until completion. For a game that released in 2005, I was still surprised of the level of graphical detail that was put into the world when I played it for the first time 8 years later in 2013. Controls are top notch and the enemies show intelligence in combat. They call out to each other and use the environment and whatever they can find to take cover. Going so far as to flip desks and tables, which for 2005 was a key factor is describing the next generation. F.E.A.R. is a series I didn't care for when I first played the sequel F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. However thanks to a Steam Sale, I was able to get all the games for a discounted price and was glad that I did. The original game is truly great using technology that still holds up to this day and difficulty that you don't find too often in current games. It truly is a great action/horror game."
76561198043596373,1388530748,True,"Unrivaled FPS action coupled with extremely well down paranormal creepiness and a phenominal story, F.E.A.R. is still setting the standard of what an action/suspense game should be.  You need to buy this game, period."
76561198097022477,1388529117,True,"Very fun game, does not give cards or lvl, but still very fun, Very creepy though"
76561198085645206,1388468829,True,"A classic and must-play for fans of FPS or Horror games. F.E.A.R. provides some solid storytelling and more than a handful of scares. The visuals, though dated, do not detract from the great gunplay and unsettling atmosphere. Get this if you love shooters and have yet to experience F.E.A.R."
76561198020579703,1388463802,True,"Great FPS horror game. Has very polished gameplay despite its age and this may be due to the great AI which give battles a great tension. The horror aspect is not overdone and keeps the game from being a bland military shooter. Fights with enemies always feel different thanks to a strong variety of weapons and a cool bullet time ability. You can slow down time and watch bullets glide past you and grenade shoockwaves toss enemies around. The graphics are the weakest part of this game and i dont mean that in a technical sense. Lighting is decent and so are textures for the time it came out. The only problem is the damn color palette. Every room and corridor are painted grey. Grey walls, grey floors, grey guns, grey everything. Atmosphere is great but that damn grey makes me wish they used more color in the game but its not a game breaking issue. In summary, the game has great FPS gameplay, atmosphere and AI. I feel the game is more focused on shooting and less on horror but that shouldnt prevent a horror fan from picking it up, especially if they enjoy first person shooters."
76561198042584822,1388426783,True,"In my opinion, one of the best FPS games to ever exist. Although the story can be cheesy at best, the gameplay more than makes up for it. A truly nerve-wracking atmosphere combined with unmatched A.I. sets up for awesome moments, and the Slow-motion feature still works very well even with the older graphics. There are moments where the game's age can bog it down, but bar that it still is a great game. 

If you've played FEAR 3 and you didn't enjoy it, at least give the original a chance.

One can only hope for an HD remake!"
76561198028888442,1388423654,True,"Honestly after playing the first Dead Space game and returning to the Ishimura in Dead Space 2, I didn't think I could really get into a horror/thriller game with as much passion. F.E.A.R. overcame it's outdated graphics with such great and unexpected suspense that I didn't think was possible, this is definitely one of the best games I have ever played.

Haven't really felt that much post-game late night irrational fear since watching 'The Ring' at age 13, if you're on the fence about buying this, just do it. It's worth your time and money."
76561198083268804,1388420316,True,"F.E.A.R may be an old game, however don't let that influence you buying this game. The game has an amazing atmosphere anddoes a great job at revealing the story line and creeping you out. This game was very good. Besides some of the shooting aspect of it. If you are looking for a FPS, this is probaly not it. Its shooting and gun fights are sort of clunky, but it makes up for it in story and mood and atmosphere. I would definently recommend this game. 9/10."
76561198077720967,1388379804,False,"This is one of the most tedious games I've played this year, second only to FEAR 2. It takes place mostly in the most improbable office building ever built. I know horror is subjective and going ""lol never scared"" is a weak complaint at the best of times but I was honestly bored more by the atmosphere of the game than anything else."
76561198027267233,1388320534,True,Great Story FPS Game!
76561198069601704,1388309062,True,"I originally recieved F.E.A.R as a birthday present from my parents when it was released. Being into horror I relished to have the experience that movies provide but with a game. Whilst the mechanics of F.E.A.R are brilliant and the game play is one of the most satisfying, it is the story I enjoy the most. As you progress through F.E.A.R you find out where this little girl comes from and why she is there to begin with. Some games have pure story, some have pure game play, F.E.A.R has both and makes them both work extremely well. This also applies for the sequels which are just as fun and entertaining."
76561197975903013,1388282808,True,Boo.
76561197965069079,1388242278,True,"Absolutely classic run and gun game play with light horror themes and near-future weaponry. Pick it up if you like shooters, you won't regret it. The later installments are a bit iffy from what I've read, but the game that started the franchise still holds up today as a solid experience.

When FEAR was new, it changed up the classic arena shooter formulas by introducing melee attacks (jump kicks, slide kicks, etc...) and limiting the number of weapons you could carry to 3, but the biggest feature was the bullet-time mechanic which has been used in a lot of games since. I'm not going to get into a long discussion here, but hitscan (projectiles you can't dodge in mid-flight, as opposed to say a Doom imp's fireballs) weaponry is difficult to implement in games because you can't dodge it, you can only either soak the hits (unrealistic) or hide from it behind chest high walls (not fun). FEAR neatly solved this problem with bullet-time by allowing you to move so much faster than your enemies you could dispatch them without needing to soak up hits or hide for very long (only if you ran out of bullet-time).

If you like this I highly recommend the two expansions, Perseus Mandate and Extraction Point. They are full games and essentially more of the same, but there is nothing wrong with that when the game play is this good."
76561198025660003,1388194995,True,"This game is possibly one of the scariest games of its time and can still continue to be scarier than a lot of the horror games that are being released today. F.E.A.R shows an amazing use of jump scares and just has a somewhat creepy feel to it that makes the player think that something is going to jump out at them or attack them even when there is nothing set in the game to do so. 

I'd say this game is definitely worth the money if you love a good shooter and an amazing horror game. The mechanics and graphics are amazing for it's time!"
76561198018258940,1388185785,True,"I cannot believe this game is about 8 years old! AI of replicas just awesome! The graphic quality is a little low but since it is old game, I just do not care."
76561198111151377,1388180563,True,"Do you want to be scared? Do you want to turn off your brain and just play? Then I recommended this game.
I also love shadows in this game, sometimes im scared just by own shadow.


PS: This game is Half life style."
76561198025439293,1388165346,False,"I am not recommending this game and I'll briefly tell you why.

I bought this game hoping for an atmospheric, perhaps even scary FPS. It was dull and totally not engaging. 

It plays....pretty well. If you want a shooter game that makes you think a bit and the game is on sale, I guess that's fine. However, this game is extremely repetitive with little changes in the environments. Also, it is not scary or intense at all. 

I will note that I went from Half-life 2 right to this. Comparatively, this game is terrible. On its own compared to all games in existence, it's adequate.

Hey, if it is $1 or $2, grab it. $5 is pushing it a bit in my opinion."
76561198012384729,1388165159,True,"the best game in the series, best multiplayer when it was still around (it still is you just got to look for it)."
76561198115181989,1388096843,True,Nice
76561197996000330,1388093593,True,"F.E.A.R is truly a masterpiece. Allowing for high paced movement and SloMo mechanics that worked well. The A.I. was excellent especially for the era in which this game was released. Enemies communicate and will flank you if you let them, run for cover or lay down covering fire. The story is also good enough to where you want to play through the game. If your not immersed by the story then you will definitely be captivated by the dynamic lighting and the lack of light in certain area's with Alma whispering in your ear, or Fettel taunting you as you keep up with him. This game is easily one of my Top 5 titles of all time and wholly recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspenseful shooters with a challenge. I would play these titles and discard the existence of 2 & 3 if I had the choice. I have played this for a great many hours before it had made it to steam."
76561198067311369,1388087751,True,"Pretty well made game all around. Scored as part of the Humble Bundle. I was hoping for a slightly scarier playing experience, but was not ultimately disappointed in this regard. I only played through once, but am interested in reloading in the future and trying the expansion packs for it as well."
76561198012748296,1388084387,True,"Have you tried survival horror games? Maybe it's time.

F.E.A.R. is a FPS game, but more importantly a survival horror.
Playing as the Point Man, part of a First Encounter Assault Recon team, your job is to locate and eliminate Paxton Fettel, a psychic able to control a battalion of Replicas. What seems to be a classic spec-ops mission will actually turn into a nightmare, that will put your enhanced reflexes at heavy use.
Through this game, you fight smart enemy soldiers, you dig into Armacham's story, you help funny and frail survivors... But you can't expect how good this game is at scaring you, nor how bad things can turn to.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGn-8Go_hnY

I find this game a good choice in order to begin survival horror games, specially if you are used to FPS ones. I suggest continuing with its first DLC, Extraction Point, which starts right when the main game stops, and puts you in an even worst nightmare than before.
I also suggest stopping before the second DLC, Perseus Mandate. Though the universe is the same and gives some good scares, it's a lot more focused on firefights and is a lot more difficult.

Be advised though: the game engine is far from optimized, so don't be surprised if you can't run it with highest details, even if you can with recent games."

76561198013197704,1388019659,True,"One of the best games I've ever played and probably the best FPS I've ever played. Gunplay is incredibly satisfying and the AI is smarter than any other I've seen. FEAR is on a different level of FPS. It's only failing is that it tries to be scary, but it doesn't really succeed in doing that."
76561198063402700,1387925412,True,"F.E.A.R. is still to this date my favourite First Person Sthooter. It offers an excellent atmosphere, some shocking moments and fun gameplay with a variety of weapons. Especially the HV Penetrator always brings a grin to my face when i nail enemies to the wall."

76561198004506330,1387844177,True,"A great game. Not really a big horror game and sometimes it seems like it forgot it is one, but it got a few scares here and there which is nice. It also have this creepy atmosphere. A perfect game if you like action shooters with a few scares."
76561198043646120,1387841821,True,"One of the few games that actually scares the shit out of me. (the other being ""System Shock 2"") It took me awhile to actualy  beat the game. (about a year for about an hour a day) I was playing on the hardest setting and didnt realize months later that I had the ability to ""slow"" down time. All this time I was playing it on the hardest setting and just slodging my way thru the game.  DAMM!! (There goes my life hours down the toilet)  However, I will say Its a good game with a truly scary unique storyline. (However unbelievable that story is) I mean they could have come up with a better excuse than a general who can control a whole battalion by mind control and eats his victims faces."
76561198034464523,1387838154,True,Quite an enjoyable game! There are some good jump scares in there and overall the game has a nice balance between action and horror. It also makes use of a nice slow motion mechanic that makes you feel like a god even if you normally such at FPS games.

76561198014043173,1387778395,True,Great game
76561198025001894,1387774575,True,"i played this game for the first time just recently, knowing it held the title as one of the best FPS ever made, and boy did it earn it, right now it easily stands as one of my favorite single player FPS of all time

first of all lets talk about arguably the game's most legendary feature, the amazing AI, its just as good as you expect with all the hype behind it, maybe even more

the AI in the game can perform a variety of complex tasks and maneuvers, they will always try to take cover, they can vault over obstacles and crouch below them too, they can jump through windows, they try to flank you or use grenades to flush you out of cover, they use supressive fire to keep you pinned down, they will blindfire, they will even push objects from the environment and use em as cover, ive never seen AI this smart in any other FPS. And its not just smart, but realistic too! the enemy will remain oblivious to your presence unless something gives your position away, like your flashlight, your gunfire, your footsteps, or one of the enemy soldiers alerting his comrades about your presence, and even after they see you they can lose track of you, shooting for a while to your last confirmed position and looking for you. The game also makes intelligent use of the enemy comm chatter, enemies will constantly report their situation to each other through radio, this helps the player know when there are enemies waiting to ambush nearby or when they lose track of the player or are about to toss a grenade. there are different types of enemies each with their own AI tough being perfectly honest enemy variety isnt one of the game strongest points, considering the good AI keeps the enemy encounters fresh and the game lasts just enough to avoid these encounters becoming stale, this is hardly a problem

also this is going to sound a bit weird, but despite the game being 8 years old by the time of writing, it still looks pretty damn good, is not crysis 3 or battlefield 4, but the game uses its visual effects in great ways to enhance the atmosphere, stuff like dinamic shadows and such, is rare to see a game that actually uses graphics technology to enhance the gameplay and not just look shiny. also the animations are just top notch, for both the player and enemies, shooting enemies is so much fun, in part due to the great gunplay, with weapons having some meaty feeling thanks to great sound and recoil, but also thanks to the huge array of animations enemy soldiers have, they react realistically to shots, will often fall to the ground and try very hardly to get back up on their feed, they will sometimes limp around after receiving too much damage and when they die they will sometimes keep the trigger pressed, spraying the room with stray bullets. the player movements are faithfully replicated by the main character, climbing, kicking, puching and firing have a very heavy and realistic feeling

the gunplay as i mentioned is great, guns have some good recoil and damage, they are also very varied, the game has a lean mechanic which is crucial to survive agaisnt the great enemy AI, the game also thankfully makes no use of stupid regenerative health, instead you have to look out for health pickups and health upgrades, as well as ""reflex"" upgrades across the levels, your ""reflex"" is used to enter an amazing slow mo mode that allows you to easily and stylishly take out challenging foes, the fantastic ragdolls of this game just make taking out foes even more satisfying, even the melee feels great!

another high note is the games atmosphere, using horror elements to set a believable spooky atmosphere, is not a survival horror game by any means, but you will easily be fooled during its most unnerving parts

the game has few but very noticeable flaws, the main one is that the environments are very samey and close quarters, its very easy to lose track and end up going in circles, is not that the levels are complex, they simply all look the same, also the same close quarters setup make firefights somewhat predictable, tough the game does make some efforts to provide engagements in more open areas, these are however the exception rather than the rule. Also while the atmosphere was great, i found the story to be merely ok, competent but nothing special with very few memorable characters

it took me 8-9 hours to complete the game, a very respectable amount"
76561198043548093,1387760584,True,"Amazing FPS, much like the original Half-Life. Graphics are a bit dated, but the gameplay is really great, and the atmosphere is pretty creepy. 8/10."
76561198050660175,1387694826,True,"Amazing! It starts out epic, and gets better as the game goes on! As a friend of mine and I tend to say: ""To Spooky!"""

For the low price, it's worth picking up."
76561198059533417,1387600551,True,The first game of the series awesome action horror one of the best horror games to date
76561197999897559,1387596083,True,"F.E.A.R. is essentially the horror equivalent of Half-Life: a FPS that manages to revolutionize the way we perceive shooters. But whereas Half-Life made an impact in the narrative department, F.E.A.R. made a mark in the combat department. Simply put, the gunplay in this game is INSANE: pieces of shrapnel fly across the screen, enemies exhibit some of the best ragdoll physics ever seen courtesy of the Bullet Time mechanic, guns feel powerful and unique, the enemy AI is still THE best AI you'll ever see in a game... The list goes on and on. Also, F.E.A.R. also sports some of the most chilling atmosphere in a game to date. Only S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Half-Life 2 achieve a similar level of excellence when it comes to ambience. But what I like the most about F.E.A.R. is the fact that it hailed from an era that saw PC games become dominant once more in the gaming market: the mid-2000s gave us some truly unique PC experiences such as Doom 3, Far Cry, Half-Life 2 and of course, F.E.A.R.. To say that F.E.A.R. is a great shooter would be a colossal understatement. F.E.A.R. deserves your attention because it manages to be consistently memorable and incredibly fun to play. And the fact that you also get two expansions alongside the main game makes buying this game all the more enticing."
76561197986300111,1387591244,True,"Excellent game, graphics hold up pretty well to aging, gameplay is fast and furious."
76561198004335431,1387574238,True,"Even though the surroundings are a bit stereotypical and corridor-like, thanks to great AI and intense combat FEAR delivers great experience spiced with horror elements. 
The first datadisc Extraction Point continues the story of the original FEAR installment and extends the sketchy and somewhat confusing plot. Action sequences are still great and enemies make you use diverse tactics. Although the overall gameplay feels like dilluted version of the original game it's still pretty damn entertaining and I'd still recommend it.
And finally the second datadisc Perseus Mandate. I made myself play it for several hours and even though it has all the elements of the original game (except from the storytelling, that's pretty BS here) when put together they don't work out at all and the result is boring mediocre FPS with dumb level design and no drive that would make you wanna play.

So to sum up original FEAR and Extraction Point thumbs up, perseus mandate thumbs down."

76561197976892633,1387181710,True,"I forgot how much of a great game the original F.E.A.R. was. I played this game way back in 2005 when it was first released, and I had an absolute blast playing though it again. It has a nice mixture of fast paced game play with some horror tossed in it. And it’s not cheesy ""American horror"" either. None of those lame sudden movements or gore that tries to gross you out. The game's horror was heavily influenced by Japanese horror movies, like the original ""Ring."" F.E.A.R. does an excellent job in making you wonder about what is going on all while keeping you on your toes as you progress through the story. 

The game is a visual treat as well. F.E.A.R, being a game that first came out on PC back in 2005, has definitely aged but it has aged well. Some parts of the game just look fantastic. The designers have done an excellent job of using the lighting to their advantage. The shadows and overall dark environments of the game help to enhance the atmosphere. Even the small things, such as lights flickering, lights of a phone that has a voicemail on it, and empty offices where the only light source is a computer monitor just help to make it that much creepier. You’ll find yourself constantly using your flashlight, and dread walking through long dark hallways. 

I highly recommend this game, even if you're not a big fan of first person shooters. It’s definitely a must buy if you don’t have it already, and a great game to add to your collection. It goes on sale constantly on Steam, so don’t hesitate to pick it up if you’re interested. F.E.A.R. 2 was also a pretty great game. I personally liked it a lot, but I found the first one to be a bit better. The expansion packs for the first game were just pretty average. I have not played F.E.A.R. 3, but I’ve heard that it’s the least well received of the trilogy. 

You’ll be perfectly fine with just the original F.E.A.R.

76561197999361273,1387178253,True,"I think it's a competant game, the guns all work, theres nothing that just jarringly throws you out of the game (aside from the screamer-level faces before you go into spoopy psychic world) but I never had anything legitimately terrify me, there are some things that are nice touches, but most of the scares come from startles rather than actual scares, and the enemies really have only amounted to just bad dudes with guns (in fact they repeatedly call them 'bad guys')

I'm only 7 hours in, but I feel like it's a fair point to make a judgement call on it, I think it's a fun game, but the horror aspects are lacking, it's not a failing of age either, I'm easy to scare, and can get some spoopy scares from early Resident Evils or Silent Hills, not to mention the addition of what is possibly THE MOST USEFUL POWER FOR A SUPER SOLDIER TO HAVE EVER FOREVER makes you seem slightly overpowered.


I'd give the game a 6/10 if I had to give a number, I'd recomend it if you're looking for just something to kill a weekend with, but I wouldn't put it on any lists."

76561198040348222,1386980245,True,"If you can get past the old textures (see below if you don't), F.E.A.R is still a good horror-FPS that holds well to modern standards while keeping a lot of the ""older"" FPS elements like rewards from level exploration. 

How's the gameplay ?

The weapons, while beign quite standard, have a good feel to them and are pretty much balanced depending on the situations. This, coupled with the slow-mo makes gunfight quite tense and enjoyable.

How are ennemies ? 

There are very few bulletspongy ennemies and the AI manages things quite well. Its able to flank you, use grenades to push you out of cover and aims decently. There are enought scripted ambushes and other unsuspected situations able to push you out of comfort zone and keeping you away from borederom. 

How's the level design ?

The level design is quite linear and dosen't offer a lot of different approaches and somewhat lacks variety, but its not bad and serves well the claustrophobic atmosphere of the game, there are some hidden powerups that'll be grealtly helpfull, forcing you to explore a bit.

Is there stealth in it ?

From what I've tried, ""stealth"" works in this game, ennemies can spot you by sound but also because of your flashlight, walking and crouching to reduce your noise can allow you to surprise ennemies or seldomly knock them down without beign noticed. 

What about the story and the athmosphere ?

Its quite a decent story for an FPS I guess, it builds up slowly and gives you clues as you progress and the final is quite memorable. The horror aspect is very efficient for a first run, less on a second but sucessfully goes beyond beign just a jumpscare fest. There are whole levels made up to build up the tension and the line between reality and illusion isn't always explicit.

What are the known issues and possible improvements on modern systems ?

- If you have a logitech keyboard like a G110, you might come accross a hudge frame drop. There's a workaround on the steam forum about it, there's also an utility online for this fix, but I'd suggest you do things manualy, safer and probably more effective.
- If you find the textures too ugly, know that someone is working on remplacing them with HD textures here : http://www.moddb.com/mods/fear-texture-overhaul"
76561198030252953,1386969942,True,"F.E.A.R. is a great game that can stand the test of time. It is a semi average shooter by todays standards, but what is really a stand out is the mature themes and the storyline. Had me gripped from the start and held me to the end, tempting me to push deeper to find out more about the situation and the character... Quite satisfyingly creepy at most times!

76561197979894180,1386645914,True,"I remembered this game being a lot more unnerving, but that was purely in retrospect. I also remember being more impressed by the AI and difficulty than I am now. The atmosphere, though unique enough to stand out in my memory, is ultimately ruined by how repetitive the clostrophobic level design is, and how most places end up looking way too similar. There is never a large enough outdoor area or interesting change in location and textures to really give you a breath of fresh air. It's all labrynthine offices, labs, and abandoned complexes with little outdoor exploration. The biggest change up in terms of level location are the stages that take place in delapidated ghetto homes and what's left of the city, but it's hardly much of a difference. I mainly enjoy this game out of nostalgia, and for being able to hit everything with the butts of my guns. The combat it also somewhat rewarding in how each gun kills enemies, such as nailing them to walls, shooting off different body parts, and straight up blowing them to bits. The more I think about it, the more I want to (slightly) recommend it. Maybe it's still retained its freshness for someone who's yet to experience it."
76561198028968878,1386613732,True,It's like Half-Life with a lot more horror in it. It's awesome :D

76561197988711752,1386501569,True,"85% - A Classic That Has Aged Well!

The game tells the story of an anonymous operative known as Point Man, who is part of a team, called First Encounter Assault Recon, sent in to investigate the goings on at a site in the Auburn district, with reports of gunfire in the area. It isn’t long before the player is thrust headlong in to the midst of a paranormal nightmare, as all of his squad mates are slaughtered in the blink of an eye by some unexplained malevolent force. And this is only the beginning of the game too – the pace picks up from there as there are many action-packed gunfights (enhanced by slow motion) with extremely intelligent and intimidating enemies to be had, and supernatural creatures – some that can’t be killed by conventional means – to face off against, and not to mention there are plenty of scares.

This isn’t a Doom 3 type game where there are monsters hiding in a closet waiting to pounce on you. This involves the player embarking on a dark, twisted, psychologically tormenting journey in to a brilliantly crafted world where they will strive to put the pieces of a much larger story together.

There are several inspirations evident in F.E.A.R. as it draws from famed horror films such as The Ring, and by extension the Japanese film it was based upon, Ringu. This is easily the best in the series, and Monolith shows its mastery when it comes to the horror genre.

The only real gripe I have with the game – and it’s a very minor one at that – was perhaps the sound effects, particularly the weapons, which I found to be a little flat sounding, although there is a wonderfully fitting soundtrack composed by Nathan Griggs that more than makes up for it."

76561198069180353,1386459168,True,"This is actually a shooter masquerading as a horror. The enemy AI is masterfully crafted to take full advantage of the environment and surprise you. It plays different every single time. There's also the slowmo that's incredibly satisfying to use along with the shotgun. Gunfights are almost ripped out of a John Woo movie, with bits of environment flying all over the place. It's a must play and practically a steal at this price."
76561198012408755,1386422467,True,"Absolutely Fantastic game, it's not one of those game where you shoot and they instantly know where you are, they have to search that area giving it more of an edge. Rather scary too! Got the whole series in a Humble bundle. So far so good!"

10/10
(When this was released its visual effects were amazing, along with the gameplay and storyline I'm giving it a solid 10 outta 10. Still shudder when I think of this game...)"
76561198035580869,1386380452,True,"What is F.E.A.R.? It is the name of a video game I designed in school. And then the name was used by some other dudes a year later. But my game would have been way scarier.

F.E.A.R. (Fucking Evil Aliens Rising) Na not really, is more or less a generic FPS, with some horror thrown in the mix. You are a silent dude who can go Slow-Mo and do karate kicks, running through warehouses and offices, shooting up marine-type guys and a few robot guys. It's like Call of Duty. You run in, the bad guys go ""Oh shit!"", you shoot their asses down. It's nothing new, apart from being able to slow down time and do some meaty headshots, and a few weapons that don't exist in the real world.

Oh and, through all this there is a creepy little girl / an older version of herself, and a cannibalistic ghost scatting about the place. It is freaky, for a while. But if you've played Amnesia or Outlast, the jumpy bits in this become a bit.. meh. Basically you turn a corner, one of the ghosts is standing there, the screen goes blurry and flashes, the ghost disappears. You walk down a corridor, the room changes, the ceiling is covered in blood, the ghost chats bullshit about how you're going to die, then disappears. The game slows down and goes blurry, the ghost chats more bullshit, then disappears. Rinse and repeat.

So if you're looking for scares, go for Amnesia or Outlast as I said, or Dead Space. F.E.A.R. serves it's purpose as a meaty run -and-gun shooter with a good story, nothing more. And the expansion packs, forget about 'em, they are Copy/Paste jobs. Get 'em if you're not already satisfied with killing hundreds of soldiers.

By the way I think there's a Logitech bug on this, which makes the game lag even though your computer may be awesome.

Google that shit up.

+ Interesting story
+ Good action
+ Still has those scary moments that would make you jump

I would recommend playing EXTRATION POINT and then PERSEUS MANDATE (both DLC) right after completing the game, as it fills up the gap of the whole story and the enjoyment of getting new weapons along with new enemies."

The scary moments that you encounter in the game aren't as scary as you may think it is, but there are moments that gave me the chills.  

     However I do have a minor problem with the graphics in the game. I'm not talking about how good the textures look or the lighting effects. I'm talking mostly on its enviroments. The game is just too grey, and your always going to be on that same area for mostly the second act. 

     The Story: (NO SPOILERS) You are a part of a secret organization made by the U.S Government called First Encounter Assault Recon (F.E.A.R.) who are designed to take care of paranormal threats. You the player take control of a mute Point Man who has been assigned to take down Paxton Fettel who is in control of a prototype clone army. The voice-acting is decent, and the cutscenes are made well, but the side stories are just boring, especially since you need to stay near the answering machine to even listen to the message. Overall the story is interesting, but its just wasn't executed properly.

 Problems aside It is a really good game for what it is and I highly recommend you check it out."
76561198066268034,1386036454,True,"Have you ever played a game thats still fun reguardless of how old it is? Or how many times you've beaten it? Well FEAR is without a doubt, one of those games. This horror FPS classic is still one of my personal favorites.   Anything from the atmosphere, graphics, soundtrack, story, enemy AI. FEAR devlievers that in an excellent way.  

True, the game's scares may not shake you up the second time around. But, it doesn't ruin the atmosphere. You have that sense of someone watching you even when the room is empty. (Or littered with the bodies of the soldiers you shot to pieces.)  FEAR also has that sense of helplessness. Like no matter how hard you try, the bad guys are always one step ahead. So it moves away from the typical hero formula of where the hero always wins in the end. 

The AI does the enemies in the game justice. Have you played a game where the enemy was supposed to be a ""professional"" killer? Or something similar? But, they were dumb as bricks? Well this is not so for FEAR. The AI is quite intellegent. The soldiers will actually work as a squad to take you down. For example, say you were in cover against a sqaud, the squad members will attempt to flank you or flush you out with a grenade. But, while you're trying to get out of harms way. The soldiers are waiting at the ready to gun you down.  (and believe me, it can be easy for them to do so.) 

Overall, I recommend this game to those that enjoy good creepy shooters/ supernatural games. Being a firm believer in the paranormal, this game is even more interesting to me."

76561198001310229,1386001714,True,"The original F.E.A.R. was a great game combining elements of horror, fast paced action and great combat sequences into one nice little game. In F.E.A.R. you are part of a special squad to take down a rogue psychic soldier who has control over a whole army or replica soldiers. To aid you in this struggle is your ability to slow down time to take on several enemies on the go.

The game mechanic works really well, since your usually swarmed by clever AI, the way the slow mo is used is quite marvellous and it feels like you’re in one of John Woo’s movies. 

Granted you only got the most out of the game if you played on the highest difficulty settings which really put you at level footing with the AI. Even today the gameplay holds well and weapon choice is ample as well as being creative.

I recommend getting the game since it also comes with the expansion packs as well, Overall a great classic pc game if you just want a quick paced fps."

The game is filled with cheap jump scares but still grips you with it's eerieness. There are tons of enemies to kill in the linear and layered levels but they're too easy, even on the hardest difficulty. If I had to pick, I would say gamplay difficulty and widescreen   compatibility would be the only thing holding this game back. Grab t on sale and you won't be disappointed."

Outside of those two facts FEAR is a well designed shooter with some fun gameplay, and great lighting effects and AI (for the time). If you like FPS (non-competitively, that is) then you can't go much wrong with the campaign as even when it occasionally tries to rip off of Half Life, it does so correctly. The game isn't exceptional (the sequal I would call an underrated gem), it isn't a bad buy or a bad time if it's on sale for $5-10, especially if you like horror games. If you are looking for an altogether great game, I would recommend FEAR 2 over this one, but this is a great place to start if you want to follow the story, and it won't hurt you as it's campaign is farely short."

76561198009601896,1385841853,True,"F.E.A.R is a classic FPS game for the PC in which you star as ""Pointman"", a soldier with a mysterious past being flung into a situation to hunt down a psychotic madman known as Paxton Fettel, who has hyjacked a rogue army of psychically controlled ""replicas"", which are to say, super soldiers. Oddly, they act like normal people, they even swear and feel pain, but somehow don't.. have a mind of their own, because they'r- okay, forget it. That's the theme of this game, forgetting. Wade tries to forget Alma, Aristide tries to make the world forget Alma and ""bury the dead"", and you try to forget the expoisition you just heard or the bit you just experienced because nuh-uh-uh-uhhhhthing is going to make any sense at all unless you go to the F.E.A.R wiki and read it all for yourself.

Apart from the confusing storyline, there's the dissappointing characters. Whilst Alma herself is a boss and is rightfully the main focus of these games, the other characters you meet along the way are somewhat more dissappointing. Perhaps with the exception of Wade.

How he got out, how he recovered from a bullet wound and how all the blood miraculously dissappeared is not explained. Also, what then happens to him isn't explained.) Ms. Wade, whilst we have some attachment to her because we had to spend some time with her, still has a lackluster death. There's no rhyme or reason to it. Instead of killing her and eating her perhaps in the apartments or immediately after finding her, they do it in the facility - and her death is only mentioned when you kill off Fettel, the primary objective of the game since the start. If you don't pay attention, you'll probably miss her bloodied corpse on the ground altogether and believe that it was a loose end. Underplaying a little much? And lastly, Fettel. You shoot him in the face. That's it. No bosses, no catching up to him, no getting him by surprise, he traps you in a hallucination and then somehow, for some reason, you're able to shoot him in the face after a few waves of weak enemies. Primary antagonist of the game, folks.

Wade's death was a bit more appropriate, and although we're given very little insight into his character, his death still seems appropriate. Perhaps not in the way that he died, but the fact that Alma kills him. Fact that he shoots fatty, and that he brings about his own death, directly, because of the guilt that he can't FORGET.

SPOILERS OVER

That all said, the game is overall, pretty fun in bursts. You get an arsenal of weapons of which you can only pick 3 to carry at any given time, mechs and tougher enemies tend to serve as bosses, you're not only limited to grenades, you have mines, remote bombs, the unreal 2 engine delivers dynamic lighting, big explosions feel BIG and your guns feel appropriately powerful. Enemies will explode into little giblets if you hit them with enough force, with I've often been able to do with the shotgun. Enemies respond appropriately to being shot (okay, somewhat, they are supersoldiers, but they're also human, so it's a half and half thing) and their AI is decent enough to sometimes flank you and sometimes, outright kill you. You're constantly upgrading yourself via the use of health boosters and reflex boosters, which allow you to go into slow motion for a select (usually kinda one-sidedly long) amount of time. There's also a variety of types of enemies, giving some true difficulty to the game as it goes on. The controls are good but require some rebinding for modern tastes and Pointman feels like he has some weight to him.

Oh, and, F.E.A.R is not scary. Not even in the slightest. There's a few true scares, but, it's usually not adequete of the ""horror"" title. It's more appropriate to call it horror ""themed"". There's the ""theme"", but it's really just an FPS. 

I'd recommend it, but, I'd prefer F.E.A.R 2 to it. You don't NEED to play F.E.A.R 1 in order to understand F.E.A.R 2, either."

For me the best apect of the game is undoubtedly the enemy AI. Enemies use cover really well, you'll find yourself frequently getting flanked and, if turn up the game difficulty, you'll have some really competative firefights on your hands. Lots of new FPS could learn a lot from this game's AI. Having said that, the locations are really repetative though."
76561198033086261,1385726026,True,"For a game written in 2005, FEAR holds up remarkably well.  Playing at 1080p with all the options maxed, it really does not feel that old.  There is a noticeable squareness to the environments but this feels more like deliberate art direction than a limitation of 8 year old technology.  There is a beautiful simplicity to the gameplay too - compared to a modern game such as Far Cry 3, this is a tightly-focused stripped-down elegant shooter where the only thing that matters is blowing bad guys away.  While the environments are fairly linear, this fits well with the horror theme.  Like the classic bad dream, your only option is to walk through the door at the end of the corridor even though you know you aren't going to like what you find there.  The story is so-so but largely superfluous. The environment builds tension on it's own.  The horror is less the visceral in-your-face variety of, say, Bioshock, more the subtle psychological horror of Silent Hill. Instead of chainsaw-wielding maniacs leaping out of cupboards at you, there are flickering lights, unexplained footsteps and phantom photocopiers.  After a long session with FEAR I really had to concentrate to relax the knots that had formed in my shoulders.  This game is an absolute classic. Buy it!"

I never got tired of blowing people in to a mass of red mist with the og so satisfying shotgun or any other guns this game offers. It also felt great that the enemy AI in this game is SMART, actually moving to flank you, throwing grenades at the right times, and actually being accurate.

Dont let this game drive you away because of the scare factor, it is not the main focus and only contributes to the story.

Going into slow motion mode during combat was super fun!!

76561197979486043,1385499836,True,"When F.E.A.R first launched in 2005, people were blown away with the technical level of its graphics. Unfortunately for the gamers of today, Monolith Productions forgot to implement any art style or set pieces what so ever. The most fearful thing about this game is how cold and sterile the world seems, rather than its imitation of Samara from The Ring. Thanks to said girl, the game was also commended on living up to its name, thanks to scripted sequences involving corridors of blood à la The Shining, and cheap jump scares. I’m not really sure what all the fuss was about, considering horror masterpieces Resident Evil (2002) and Silent Hills 1 (1999), 2 (2001) and 3 (2003) had long been on the market. The ‘spooky sequences’ played out as little more than a predictable ghost train, and couldn’t actually harm the player. Sure, they broke down the repetitive battles, but to any seasoned horror game fan, they felt shallow. Condemned: Criminal Origins (2005) did a far greater job of striking fear into players in a first person perspective, and using the very same engine as F.E.A.R. 
My other major complaint about the title is that while starting out solidly enough, the cliché story becomes vague and muddled throughout the campaign, and although their back stories are vaguely revealed, the characters entirely fail to develop.

Yet despite these major flaws, I would recommend this game (or it’s first expansion pack) to fans of the FPS genera in a heartbeat, thanks to some of the best gunplay I have seen in games, even to date. Whilst the weapons might be neither realistic nor visually interesting, the kinaesthetic feedback from a firefight is uncannily satisfying. Be it a pistol, shotgun, smg or rifle, the ricochets, plaster chips and dust clouds that get kicked into the air are immensely satisfying in a way that the game’s sequels never managed to replicate. In addition to this, the enemy AI is still some of the best I have seen, so gunning down waves of clones as they squeal in fear over their radios  never out stays its welcome, despite the frequency of battles.
If you enjoy shooing things from a first person perspective and have any interest in games that predate a couple of years, you owe it to yourself to play F.E.A.R

76561198045354004,1385488122,True,"With the in mind factor this is from 2005 and its the whole getting the hang of physics engines thing (still kinda dont), this is a gem of a game, i guess if your into horror stuff this is cool for you. I found the broken if not baffling ragdoll physics humorous and kept every weapon feeling fresh and readily usuable (i still used the 10mm HV Penetrator 9/10 times for any given moment). Maybe im just a cold human being or mildly psychotic even but nothing in the main game honestly bothered me much, there was one or two jump scarish things that i guess got me but it was mostly just the Metroid Prime room to room feeling that put you any form of edge. Hell i found myself laughing at the game than being scared simply due to the physics and the the ability to pin ""Test Tube Motherfuckers"" to walls. So far havent quite finished Extraction yet (adendum) but so far Extraction has some honestly scary shit comparably, made me question progression or even how to move on. So all in all fun game easy to enjoy, physics, isnt really scary till dlc ...ect id reccomend it to people that arent into horror as well as those who are. Adendum: Finished Exrtaction Point, its a 6 hour worthwhile follow up open ended wrap up to FEAR."
76561197982378801,1385488025,True,"One of the most awesome FPS experiences you can play through.
Also, shit gets scary."
76561198028571457,1385485403,True,"To put it short, F.E.A.R. is an excellent game. Why? Because it does right the one thing it has to do right: shooting. The weapons are fun and feel good, there's enough different weapons to keep interest. It feels great seeing the damage your weapons do: enemies bleed when you shoot them, certain weapons can even nail them to walls, and whenever your bullets hit walls, they leave a mark you'll surely see. Overall, gunplay feels the way it should.

Not only that, but gameplay is made even more fun by one of the best AI's I've seen in a shooter. The AI can, naturally, take cover when necessary, but what really sets it apart is its ability to move. The AI doesn't just camp behind a wall, it actually moves in a sensible way and it actually tries to flank the player when it sees a chance for that. The AI works outside direct combat as well: It gets confused in ambushes, and it can lose the player, in which case it will actively search for the target. Tired of dumb AI? Try out F.E.A.R.!

F.E.A.R. isn't only a shooter, though. There's also the horror side to it. It's not all that scary but for a person that's easily scared (like me), it's pretty good. The game is generally paced so that shooting and horror parts take turns. The game also has a decent storyline which should keep your interest for one playthrough. Make no mistake, though: You will not be playing the game just for story.

Graphically, the game still works. By todays standards, it's nothing great but it works and it has aged surprisingly well. Nothing looks antique, and the game really benefits from its dynamic lighting. Style-wise, the game is pretty boring. It's office complexes, gray corridors, and then some more gray corridors. Gray is the color of F.E.A.R. along with black.

In addition to the things mentioned above, there's not much to tell about F.E.A.R. It has a multiplayer component which went free some years ago. It felt pretty good but I don't think it has any memorable gamemodes to keep interest. You can pretty much forget the multiplayer for this game. Sound effect are decent for both shooting and horror, with the typical static radio chatter and all. Music must not've been very memorable as I don't remember any.

Overall, F.E.A.R. is a good game. You won't find a great horror game in it, but if you're a friend of shooters, you will definitely want to try it out thanks to its solid gunplay and excellent AI."

This is an ""Oldie, but goodie"". The graphics and visuals are old (you can't blame them though, this game is OLD), so it works great on low-end PCs and laptops. The experience is still at its best though; I quickly played through the whole thing. I think, however, this was meant to be a ""horror game"". It lacks in that aspect, at least for me, due to its typical ""pop-scares"", and perhaps due to its low graphical capability (because of its time, once again).

Well, Its supposed to be. But i don't know if i like the graphics or not. Mostly you're walking around in office spaces and plain corridors and suddenly you might be outside for awhile. Common soldiers to kill. And suddenly you encounter killing machines, and then you arent? It's like plain.. cool!... plain... cool!
You easily take damage if you run into things, and this is where your slo-mo ability comes to use, which replenish when not in use. Weapons are OK i guess, but i didn't always find a clear distinction of what worked best in a situation.
This is one of those hard to understad stories, but it was still kinda interesting. Not that i was 100% sure what was going on all the times, but i it seems to have a complicated backstory, which is cool.

Some of the biggest problems were level design flaws that could make you stuck and looking for that ""hidden"" ventilation to get further. I personally had some lag-issues after awhile, which were fixed by resetting the game. Not sure what was up with that.

This game felt kinda like Half-Life in the gameplay. It's an OK game. I can't recommend it, but it's not bad either."

When I saw this on the Humble Indie WB Bundle, I jumped on it. F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon) is a first person shooter with some interesting horror elmets thrown in. You play as Pointman, your typical mute hero (as many were during the dawn of the Xbox 360, which is where I first played this game) who has been transferred to the F.E.A.R. Unit and is tasked with hunting down Fettel, a phsycic warrior who is able to link his mind to Cloned soldiers and issue them orders. All the while you do this there is something more sinister behind the curtain, a small girl known as Alma. Who is she? What is Fettel up to? All those answers can be found within the chapters of the game. Gameplay isn't realy innovative, point and shoot is pretty much all you do, but it's the complex and dark story that keeps you sitting in your chair. My only real ""beef"" with the game is the lack of proper controller support. I know what your going to say, but i was a console baby so playing FPS's with a mouse doesn't come natural to me, not to mention i'm playing on a laptop. A must have for any fan of both action and horror."
76561197972273179,1385419639,True,"F.E.A.R is a good game. It’s not a great game, it’s a good game. You’ll traverse corridors upon corridors, and hurdle through hundreds of bland office cubicles. You’ll shoot the same enemy from start to finish, experience some of the most cliche horror themes the industry has to offer. But still, it’s a good game.

You see, it’s wonderful what solid gunplay and clever A.I can do for a game. The somewhat limited arsenal packs a lot of power so you really feel each shot. It’s just wonderful to use these against enemies that feel alive - truly, this was released in 2005 and few games since have had enemies which act so well. It’s interesting watching them attempt to flank the player, push over nearby shelves for cover, and crawl through small gaps in the environment to avoid grenades. Why don’t we see this sort of behavior in more games? I love it! 

Due to it being quite repetitive, I’ve been enjoying it in short bursts. It feels like one of the last good “old school” shooters. I only wish I was able to experience when it was brand new. I’m sure it would have blown my mind at the time!"
76561197974965760,1385418719,True,One of the FPS games ever.
76561197987119320,1385415329,True,"F.E.A.R is up there with Half-Life and other classics for its sheer level of detail, polish and chaotic fun.

Even as we approach 2014, the visual fidelity of F.E.A.R is still something to behold. Firefights explode in a shower of particles and dust quite unmatched in most other games. You will rend various levels apart with bullets as you play as The Point Man, a member of First Encounter Assault Recon, and each encounter will have a level of cinematic mayhem that time has yet to have dulled. The inclusion of a bullet time mode really makes this shine as the chaos unfolds in slow motion, as well as being a useful tool in the games later, more challenging levels.

The game's AI is fiercely on-point, something which evokes Half Life 1 most strongly of all. Enemy soldiers will communicate with one another and actively work together to seek you out, relaying your position over radio and reacting to your strategies in compelling and exciting ways. This is a game with better AI than most modern shooters.

The horror elements of F.E.A.R are a little on the nose - sudden flashing images of a corpse are not exactly ways that the game 'earns' its jumps - but for each cheap shot it takes in this regard it generally more than makes up with a tense, often surreal, atmosphere and a solid number of ""gotcha!"" moments that aren't cheap at all. Alma has become quite the icon in horror gaming, and she does her part in providing the occasional terrifying moment.

With rock solid shooting, wonderfully dramatic effects - including great ragdoll physics - and servicable story, it's hard not to recommend F.E.A.R. Its quality and attention to detail set a high benchmark for its sequels, and indeed all other action titles."

While the graphics are undeniably dated, F.E.A.R. still manages to pull you in to a dark tale that revolves around an cannibal convict, a creepy little girl, and a horrible secret. You play as Point-Man, a silent protaganist, and newest member of the First Encounter Assualt and Recon team and as your first mission you are charged with the responsibility of tracking down and apprehending violent murderer, Paxton Fettel. Though Fettel is just one man, capturing him will prove to be difficult as he is escorted by an army of replica soldiers (clones). Why are there clones, you ask? I'd love to tell you but the story is a little convoluted as are many in the horror genre, though this is eventually explained, it's sometimes hard to understand whats going on in the story if your not paying close attention (though there are recordings and the like that provide a more detailed backstory). As interesting as the story is, most will remember the vivid dream sequences and the constant dread that F.E.A.R.'s atmosphere provides. A moment that stood out to me involved a dark office space where the shadows always seemed to stalk you, barely audible whispers, a ringing phone and a bloody ceiling.  

In addition to being host of a powerful atmosphere, F.E.A.R. happens to be a really fun shooter. Your enemies display a degree of independace that is still uncommon today. Replica soldiers will notice you if you are loud or forget to turn off your flashlight. When in battle, replica forces will often create cover, communicate with each other and flank you. Your enemies are also very accurate and provide a healthy challenge for experienced shooter fans. While F.E.A.R. offers the standard shooter arsenal of shotgun, rifle and smg and a few interesting novelties (one weapon turns people into bloody skeletons with a single hit) the slo-mo mechanic ensures that there is much fun. voices are distorted, bodies fall into crumpled heaps, and body parts fly in a symphony of blood and gore.

Though the game looks old and lacks any multiplayer component, It's still a well done shooter that provides gripping chills, adrenaline soaked firefights and a story you wont soon forget and at ten dollars, it's a steal.

EDIT: Just went back for another playthrough (04/2020) and F.E.A.R. has aged really well all these years later. While F.E.A.R. is definitely of it's era and lacks polish when compared to AAA games of the late 2010s and here now in 2020. What's left after a brief stroll through the options and key bindings is solid gameplay and a fun story. F.E.A.R. is a unique example of a quality linear singleplayer  FPS and is worth a visit."

The game subject isn’t too similar and the levels are a bit more dull and repetitive but the gameplay and feel of running and shooting is definitely on par. In addition F.E.A.R. has a bullet time mechanic that brings an additional ton of fun to the action. It’s supposed to be a scary game but unless you are really easily scared the horror elements are quickly reduced to an eye-roller level of impression. But the action is good! It really is. I had so much fun playing this game that I immediately jumped to the two expansions developed for the game. If you’re not looking for anything deep or realistic but rather just fun action, this is a game for you."

76561197991911356,1385203142,True,"Fear review, 

First off if your weak of heart or you are scared easily , Do not play this save yourself. Second turn off the lights grab a drink and sit down in a dark silent room and get ready for this, This game is amazing , the story is great and the mechanics are great, short but great, with 5 other games to follow the story , its great. sound is great 10/10 being one of the first games of its time to sport EAX updatable with unfotunatly useless anticheat built into it, strangely. Graphics 10/10 for its time this was it amazing and runable even on some crap computers, 9/10 story line because if your weak of heart or scared easily this is not for you, 10/10 multiplayerr, this games multiplayer is was amazing for its time, the run feature is missing from single player but can be put in threw a plug in unfortunatly, other than that the multiplayer was great but they did not have an anti cheat , the multiplayer of this game was given away for free which was a great thing to do from the publishers also the co op wihtout story was given away for free which is great and moddable with upto 64 player co op some insane things happened in this game, not sure ifthe modding community is still strong but the game has passed its icing point scince 2005 and if you played the beta multiplayer it was before that. More on the game, slow mo effect was awesome, watching the action happen is great, granade effectts are awesome, leaning for those who like it, and lots of hand to hand combat sure made vs a hole lotta fun. not sure if vs is still around (multiplayer vs) but it was great while it was. So play this game, But you have been warned. 



FEAR : Extraction point Expansion Review,

While being the first expansion to fear, takes place at the end of fear 1 so its a direct story line, With bigger fights to use your slo mo and granades more usefully, new enemies and weapons and granades, the game was good, not drastically improved, but more for those who craved more fear at the end of part 1, The graphics where great some cool stuff but not a whole lot, The sound was great, The story on the other hand sucked balls, with alot of shit pointlessly put in to try to make the whole story tie in toguether, there was alot of shock scare scenes which where very predictable and not really as scary as part 1, it was more screaming and repeatedly so it was ore annoying, some parts where scary. So if you are easily scared then dont play this.Aftert this expansions release the co op version was released for free moddable and different bigger fights, but with no story mode, the vs was boosted with a couple maps and weapons which made it even more aweome, real fast gameplay made the VS a great play, and was also free to play, In the end this one has more story but it was too little to call a story. Next will review the second 
expansion.

Fear : perseus mandate expansion.
This one takes place in the middle of part 1 and continues to part 2, with its own sidestory that fits in to the whole story, you are not the main guy like in part 1 and expansion 1 , in this one you are  different unit with its own objective.
WIth more action than the last andmore creative scare tactics this one is awesome, the story is great except for teh ending that leaves with a wtf... Aside from that you got better story than the second with more fit ins to the whole thing and tons of action , this one also adds 3 bonus non scary non story missions as a bonus, aside from the free co op and free versus that was released for everyone. these missions just add a more action so if you just wanna use a gun or missed uing it enough these missions will give you that extra umph you wanted. I liked this one more than extraction point."

2007, I put in the CD of my first PlayStation 3 game, and watched what is perhaps the most beautiful and artistic intro for a video game ever created. This to me, is with no doubt, the best game of all time. I've never been as awe-struck for a video game as I was for this one. The plot is fantastically intriguing, which while not directly told, keeps you wanting to know everything that happens, makes curiosity grasp into you, and question things, with an overall outstanding writing. The gameplay is a perfect mix of an old school and a modern shooter, appealing to nearly every FPS audience, with one of the, if not the smartest A.I. I've ever seen for its time. Astounding graphics, and even though it shows some of its age now, it can still be very impressive. Spooky and haunting atmospheres accompanied with spine-tingling soundtrack and an unfathomable amount of detail. Monolith's masterpiece. [b]10.0/10.0[/b]
[list][*][h1][i]Extraction Point[/i][/h1][/list]
If I had to define this pack with a few words, it would be [u]darkness,[/u] and [u]hopelessness.[/u] This takes [i]F.E.A.R.'s[/i] atmosphere to the next level, and makes you ponder about everything that's going on around you. The soundtrack helps a lot in this. This pack features 3 new weapons and some new enemies, making the gameplay significantly refreshing. An epic plot line along with dark environments, Timegate kept true to the original game's formula and brought the fans what they wanted. [b]9.7/10.0[/b]
[list][*][h1][i]Perseus Mandate[/i][/h1][/list]
This action packed piece comes with some of [i]F.E.A.R.'s[/i] best firefights, and is very different from the first pack. It works as a side story to the original [i]F.E.A.R.[/i] and [i]Extraction Point,[/i] and brings some new characters, such as the wisecracking Lieutenant Chen and the determined Captain Raynes. This pack contains more new weapons and enemies, very uncommon level design, goosebumping soundtrack, great voice acting and storyline, as well as a nicely set balance between scares à la [i]Extraction Point[/i] and gun battles against Replicas, ATCs, and Nightcrawlers alike. [b]9.3/10.0[/b]"
76561197983733611,1384965097,True,"While a little dated as far as visuals and general technology go, this is still a solid game that launched a franchise. Sadly the multiplayer is dead, but to me this game was more about the designers knowing that just the right amount of creepy and/or gorey visuals can leave a far more lasting and scary impression than an all out gore-fest, not to mention when to deliver them for maximum impact; after the high energy of a gun fight, having something some into view that tosses your expectations out the window was exciting."

76561198055830933,1384715516,True,"Great game and if you don't have it, get it. Old game great game play and & Control. Playing it on W7 / i7 without any problems whatsoever. Installed it and started playing. That's all there was to it. Adjusted the Settings to my liking later on. There's also a Performance Test you can run."
76561197997724945,1384711186,True,"First of all, I always heard that F.E.A.R. was an horror FPS and a very good one but after my first 2 hours on it I realized that this is not a horror FPS, it's more like a First Person Shooter with some ocasional jumpscares. The game at its core is a very solid and competetent FPS, the shooting feels great, the guns feel really authentic with a decent amount of recoil on each one and a decent variety of guns to choose which I really like. Besides the gunplay the combat gets some variety with the melee combat, which consists of punching and kicking while moving or standing and I think this one is a real plus because when you use a melee attack the animation looks really nice and gives it a certain ""style"" not only that but you can use a slow motion ""mode"" that has a certain timer to it which allows you to aim better and pick your targets more easily. For me, the shooting on a first person shooter lets me decide if the game is good or bad so what I described above pretty much makes me love this game. Besides that I think that the graphics were great looking for the time when F.E.A.R. came out and the music definitely hits the right spot at the right moment during the entire game, on the other hand I don't think that the sound design, more specifically, the gun sounds are that great but that doesn't really matter. In the end F.E.A.R. will provide you tons of enjoyment if you like FPS and also a great story with a paranormal twist to it. Do play it!"
76561197994109525,1384701612,True,"An all-time favourite.
The depressing tone, amazing AI and interesting story makes up for the repetative gameplay. I still can't get bored from it.
The multiplayer also deserves to be mentioned as I spent countless hours playing it back in the old days. Too bad there are no official servers now...

As for the expansions: Extraction Point continues the story separately from Project Origin and has some pretty good moments (like the invisible creatures which take the horror level of the game way higher).
Perseus Mandate on the other hand is just too uninteresting to play through."
76561198043584889,1384695995,True,"Good game. Gets better as you play it. Scares are scripted and boring, but level design is fun and it's a good mix between exploration and linearity. Story is weird, but the good gunplay is frequently highlighted as the game gives you stuff to shoot. Bullet time is overpowered, but no one is forcing you to use it. For shooter, not horror fans."

76561198056264254,1384546675,True,"having now beaten f.e.a.r, my verdict remains that this is maybe one of the most exciting, well-designed first person shooters ever made with a great balance of difficulty and freedom, with a really bad, dry and tasteless attempt at a horror game stapled to its back that pops up every half hour to remind you that this game is supposed to be scary and man if you didn't think it was scary before get a look at this fucked up plot twist that will blow your mind!!! remember that side character who was going to die ten minutes ago and you were given no time to even begin to care about? [i]guess who just fuckin died buddy!!![/i]

if you can get past the game literally throwing ghosts at you that are maybe less scary than the boos from mario in an attempt to remind you that you're supposed to feel like you're at a disadvantage even though you're armed with ten medkits, an anti-matter laser cannon and the ability to slow down time to nail your enemies to walls with a literal nail gun while they flee for cover and yell ""HOLY SHIT"" into their intercom, this game holds up crazy well and is an absolute blast to play"
76561198056648019,1384462195,True,"Even after 8 years, this game is still amazing..."
76561198060612684,1383919938,True,"good horror experience,however it falls into the same trap as every horror game ever in that the pattern the scares happen become too obvious and you can predict when the next scare session will be..ruining much of the atmosphere
example: in the ATC (not the shitty band i mean Amacham xD) HQ you fight through waves of soldier,then scares,then when there are no scares for a while,more soldiers,and when there are no soldiers after a while the scares begin again
imo this is heavily predictable and after a while i just didn't feel as scared as i was in the first 4-5 hours of the game and the end of the game was just me wanting to finish the story so that i actually completed the game because i didn't do it anymore for the scares
all in all,it's still a good horror game down the line it became less but still reasonable,soundtrack is good for the atmosphere,and the FPS sections (while no iron sights but that is more of a personal preference than anything else xD) are good and satisfying(the nail gun is an example)"
76561198064114593,1383815652,True,"I am just in awe at this games ability to stand the test of time it's been a fairly long time since I had a crack at it , but it still tops every shooter that I have in my steam libary. No joke"
76561198043902738,1383788509,True,"Well, that was interesting. F.E.A.R. wants to talk to the ones who seek a good mix of First Person Shooter and horror, and it does it the right way. All the good ol' ingredients for a good FPS are present : the possibility to crouch, jump, snipe, slow time ('cause you know, the guy we incarnate has incredible reflexes), a variety of weapons, of situations and the possibility to use the environment to flank the enemies. The levels are linear, don't get me wrong on that, but they are build to make us feel that they are not. 

The horror is really well dosed (if you ignore the things that move when you get near them, which are ignorable easily). The ambiance, the music, and the general sounds do give an amazing feeling and makes you always on you guard. GEnerally you can predict when the next ""horror moment"" will occur, 'cause there is some sort of rythm in-game : kill people, moment of silence, horror time, kill people, moment of silence, horror time, kill people, moment of silence and so on and so on.

In an other hand, you are killing always the exact same bad guys (even if after a while there are some military dudes making some kind of change, but not a lot since you still have to shoot them). You are getting waaaay too many medic kits for your real need (if you are experienced with FPS games).

I won't spoil anything, but I must say that the finale really impressed me by its simplicity, its twist and its class. There is only really one bad guy, and you don't even have the opportunity to shoot him.

Warm recommendation if you are a FPS fan. If you are receptive enough, you should be able to piss in your pants one or two times ;)"
76561197997619576,1383707130,True,"One of my favorite FPSs to play just because of how awesomely the slow-motion goes with the gunplay. All the weapons are very fun to use too, and, of course, the game is pretty dang scary. It's also a fairly long game as far as FPS go, at least to me. I just wish I could have played the multiplayer, since apparently they managed to make slow-motion work in that. Pretty amazing if you ask me. I think this was the first game to make that happen too. But anyway, F.E.A.R. is one of the most fun FPSs out there, and with excellent atmosphere and scares. Also, the enemy AI is a wonder to behold, even now, approaching a decade later. This game is probably the best mix of action and horror I've seen done in video games, with neither being sacrificed for the other, all while managing to be deliciously challenging the whole way through. This game really hit the sweet spot on so many levels. Monolith Productions just doesn't get quite enough credit.

The two expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, are also very fun, naturally, and certainly worth playing as well. Muthafuckin' minigun and laser cannon and lightning gun, bitches!

Apparently they're not canon though. I don't see why they shouldn't be, honestly. Sort of a Half-life: Blue Shift and Opposing Force situation with the expansions, except Blue Shift and Opposing Force are technically canon, or at least it's ambiguous and has still not been denied by Valve. Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate are apparently just not canon, under the grounds that F.E.A.R. 2 doesn't mention the events in those (Just like Blue Shift and Opposing Force! And those are canon!) and because it wasn't developed by Monolith Productions (Just like F.E.A.R. 3! And that's canon! [... unfortunately]).

So I say they might as well be canon, Extraction Point, Perseus Mandate, Blue  Shift and Opposing Force AND Dragon Ball GT. Could Half-life and F.E.A.R. take  place in the same universe?! And how does Dragon Ball fit into this?!

I guess we'll never know..."

Most games can only be in the same asylum , graveyard or ghost town until the entire genre crumbles in its illusion. FEAR is the antidote to all this, and a great FPS to boot. While alma was a bit....corny, especially if you've seen any japanese horror movie saturated with creepy girls with long black hair. This game's absolutelly frightening for anyone who's sees everything as only what it is, as officers though dead only come back to kill you as you look away, things you chase disappear without a trace, and retracing your steps only means a new series of challenges, even in a hally way you just cleared.

Pros
* Great shooting mechanics, you feel deadly as the decor and enemies are shattered by your bullets
* Graphics that were gorgeous for their time, lighting is still handled pretty well
* Interesting storyline even though its tropes are well-known by now

Cons
* Repetitive level design, repetitive enemies, repetitive storyline ; how much time can Delta Force operatives be slaughtered and helicopters can crash without becoming boring?
* The pacing is predictable, you will not be afraid during gunfights because you know there will be no jumpscares, and you won't feel threatened during the creepy parts

This is you from the past. The last time you played this game, you navigated an endless series of crates and reused assets. You didn't leave the sewers until chapter three, except in chapter four where it put you back in the sewers. You had five possible weapons to choose from and only two of them were good.

76561198054378009,1379731493,False,"FEAR is a mediocre shooter and not a horror game. If you're looking for a scary game look elsewhere. It took about 8 hours to finish and only about 5 mins of that even tries to scare you. The gameplay is passable but repetitive. The graphics feel dated. They aren't bad, just dull and empty feeling alot of the time. I think I got this and the other two games at one point for 15 bucks. Probably worth it as a bundle if the other games are decent (which I haven't played yet). By itself, I wouldn't pay more than $2.50 for it. Very meh."

PC gamers of the mid-00's may wax lyrical about how F.E.A.R looked back in the day but separated from the hype that surrounds a new graphic showpiece F.E.A.R is a drab, dull shooter that occasionally manages to create some atmosphere, but mostly feels like squandered potential.

Through the entire game you get the feeling you are playing through a movie... something few games can master. +1 to the story and another +1 to the great atpmosphere. A game very well made."
76561198026155125,1375833657,True,"I hate horror movies. Not because they scare the $%!& out of me, but because they never can, and watching a horror movie without the horror makes it either a great comedy or a great bore to me. The same can be said for some horror games which emulate the usual tropes seen in those $@*# movies. This is not one of those games, and yet it is. F.E.A.R. takes all those classic/overused tropes and elements of both horror and action movies and utilizes them so perfectly that it achieves a constant state of ""unpredictable predictability"", catching you off-guard at the absolute perfect moments while driving you insane when nothing happens while you're on your guard. 
The pacing, the plot progression, the combat, the scares, the theming, the levels, and the atmosphere (ESPECIALLY THE ATMOSPHERE) are all so excellently designed that it somehow manages to brilliantly encapsulate you in the moment; you'll find yourself acting and reacting like you would in a similar real-life scenario. And at times, when scares and combat sequences play out just right, it genuinely feels like you're playing through the perfect action/horror movie. I could go on and on but I'll end here by saying this: It's one HELL of a joyride from start to finish. The first F.E.A.R. is a diamond in the rough that deserves far more fame than some other games of yore...

The level design is well made, the maps are straightforward most of the time. It reminded me of Mirror's Edge at times since the pacing can be similar. However, I bought this game because I wanted horror. This game contains very few spooks and you only get down to spookytown at the very last Interval.

It is due to the fact that this game has some of the smartest AI in the last decade or two, bar none.
Half Life 2, Crysis? The AI in those games has NOTHING on this, with enemies flanking you, getting better positioning, calling out your flashlight, and avoiding your fire at all cost.
At the end of the day, slow motion powers won't save you, good tactical sensibilities will.
Oh, also it ends up really scary due to the contrast of grounded, realistic opponents with good AI to supernaturally driven, all powerful entities that can kill with a thought."
76561198016755763,1373941037,True,Great game. Dated visuals and you might have to do some tinkering to get it to work properly (disabling some drivers) but it's a very immersive experience nonetheless. And it's cheap as hell!

76561198086767831,1373130397,True,"F.E.A.R. succeeds as a great FPS with moments of horror.  The action is great, varied, and the ability to slow time for a little bit adds to the cinematic action as you seamlessly cut through the baddies.  The only problem I really have is that at the beginning, med-packs aren't very plentiful so you feel anxious about what is around the next corner, but a few hours into the game, med-packs are pouring out of everything.  There are usually too many med-packs than you can carry, so that kind of takes away from the anxiety.  But, overall, this is a great horror/FPS that should be on the list of buys for fans of both genres."

76561198065678891,1372704517,True,"Some years ago I saw a friend making his first steps in FEAR, now I give it a try of my own. My feelings are generally positive, though I probably should not have played all the three games in the package (the original and the two expansions) at once: when FEAR itself was over, I was excited, after finishing Extraction Point I was interested, and by the end of Perseus Mandate I was exhausted. 
It's my first thriller, and I'm certainly not disappointed. The expansion packs deserve separate recognition: they are quite the way such additions should be. Perseus Mandate, for example, is in fact a yet another game, as lengthy as FEAR itself, and having a slightly different approach to storyline (which is, I dare say, generally better than the original).
There's mostly nothing to complain about, except for some issues with walls, doors, and other obstacles (especially corners): it's very, very annoying when you are completely covered by these, but bullets sometimes still go through and hit you. Except for that, the game gave pleasant experience.
Take caution if you have weak nerves. There are rivers of blood and many fearsome visions inside the game. Even I was frightened once or twice, though I'm very resistant to such things."

Very solid awesome game and I have great memories of playing it many years ago. I put tons of hours into its MP but that's dead so it's SP only. Still 9/10."
76561198072448119,1372110947,True,"It is a great game BUY IT! Horror and FPS are pretty well tied up. Gunplay is satisfying and fun while there's still a bit of strategy involved. Combat is dynamic, enemies are regrouping according to the situation, they cleverly use cover, lean from it and communicate together. I had to conserve ammo and med-packs so it got tense sometimes. 

Game is really atmospheric and there aren't these cheap stupid jumpscares. Every one of these vision are rather cool and you will definitely have goosebumps.

Story starts in the middle and is gradually revealed to the player, there are also voice messages that help you understand world and the game does a pretty good job in this.

With a great gun variety, slow-mo, creepy ambiance, exciting story although sometimes repetitive enviroments it's still an outstanding game well worth your money and time that everybody should play."

76561197994872722,1371219231,True,"*FINAL REVIEW*
Contrary to it's namesake, I find F.E.A.R. to be far from scary in the slightest. To me, any horror game worth it's title does not have a shotgun and instead leaves the player feeling helpless and hunted.
Not to say that F.E.A.R. isn't good, the game has an addicting combat system, very dynamic gore and a wide range of enemies to keep the pace flowing. 
The game's combat system is simple in theory, you are given three weapon slots which you can fill with any weapons you come across during the game, allowing the player to mix and match any combination of shotguns, assault rifles, grenade launchers, even spike launchers and particle rifles. The player also has access to a skill called ""reflexes"" which allows the player to effectively slow down time to either initiate an assault on a fortified position, allow an escape from a dangerous situation or to simply take in the hilarious ragdolls from a dated engine. Exploration of the maps gives the player opportunities to find boosters to increase their max health and the size of their reflex bar, making them a greater threat to their enemies. 
F.E.A.R.'s gore system, given the game's age, is very impressive and hardly any games I've seen recently come close to comparing to it. From simply dismembering enemies by shooting off limbs/heads to reducing them to red mist or a charred skeleton to even sawing them clean in half with a mothertrucking shotgun. Not many games I've seen can allow you to turn your enemies into a red puddle by blasting them point-blank with a buckshot. SMOD is the only other game I can think of, and it's only a mod for Half-Life 2. 
Enemies in the game start off as the tried and true generic gas-mask soldier, the likes of which have been seen in other games like Half-Life 2 and Mass Effect 3. As the player progresses new enemies are added to the mix, forcing the player to adapt their strategies and keep the experience fresh. You might be doing an amazing push when suddenly a heavily armored tank soldier wielding a rocket launcher comes at you, forcing you to fall back and lay the path with grenades. Or a group of invisible ninja-esque soldiers can appear forcing you to go on the defensive. 
The game's story I must admit leaves a bit to be admired, the characters feel two-dimensional and are difficult to care about, and the player will often find themselves annoyed by the slow-paced Alma scare scenes meant to advance the story. But if you have the capacity to pay attention to the story then at the end of the credits you'll be rewarded with a twist and a cliffhanger for the sequel.
F.E.A.R. also suffers from some irritating bugs caused by all the recent updates to Steam's UI. By simply holding down the W key, Steam takes a screenshot every 2.5 seconds, resulting in a flooded screenshots folder than needs to be cleared out regularilty. It's like playing Pokemon Snap on the N64 with the A button taped down. 
In conclusion, despite it's software compatability hiccups and it's forgettable storyline, F.E.A.R.'s gameplay is unique and highly enjoyable. If you have the capacity to work around the screenshot bug then I definately recommend this game."

Первое дополнение к оригиналу,вышедшее в 2006ом под названием Extraction Point продолжает сюжетную линию оригинала.Стоит отметить наиболее частые и пугающие страшилки,и ""миры Альмы"".Сохранив все плюсы оригинала,дополнение также привносит в игру новых врагов,новое оружие и..(как лично мне показалось) более продвинутый ИИ.Поверьте мне.
А вот третье дополнение,вышедшее через год,после Extraction Point под названием Perseus Mandate заставляет проговорить нечто вроде ""Хммм...""
Суть в том,что после страшилок оригинала и первого дополнения,стоило бы ожидать здесь нечто..поистине заставившее бы игрока сраться при каждом шаге..Но разработчики посчитали иначе.В этой игре 90% игрового времени-шутер.Все так же интересный,с новыми врагами(наемники),оружием,но шутер.Реально страшные моменты можно персчитать по пальцам,а все остальное напоминает жалкое подобие страшилок из F.E.A.R.3.Да и сюжет....впрочем,он показывает события,идущие параллельно событиям оригинала и дополнения,потому,тут уж кому как.В итоге получился шедевральный шутер....с подавленным хоррором."

76561198063529452,1368198153,True,"With a fair learning curve, manipulative save system and genuine fun factor, F.E.A.R. not only goes the extra mile as a game, but as an example to all future first-person shooters.  The original game-play mechanics, namely slow-motion, bring a satisfying flavor that some future games have failed to reciprocate (properly).  Being a survival-horror game, there are points where the game offers jump scares and the occasional plot twist that works against the protagonist, giving players a chance to feel, if just a little, genuine fear.  Despite these elements, there's clearly a greater emphasis on action and strategy over story (though that alone has never kept a good game down).  While F.E.A.R. and it's expansion packs do offer a fun, memorable experience, the primary issue with this game is poor optimization for PC's; players may be forced to unplug and re-plug their mice and keyboards in order to keep their USB ports from flooding, which creates unplayable lag on any machine (for more info, go here: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1279444).  The fact that the game hasn't been optimized for resolutions other than 4:3 and the loss of it's (supposedly) strong multiplayer support also testifies to the game's failures in standing the test of time.  Technical shortcomings aside, F.E.A.R. offers dedicated gamers a game that's not only fun to master, but philosophically engaging."

This is a brillant gem of a game and one of the last true arcade style shooters to hit the gaming industry before almost all have died out before the whole Call of Duty craze. This is also one of the last true PC game exclusives before PC games became just a port of the console version.

The graphics are amazing for their time but may show some age to some gamers. If you don't care about graphics, the gameplay is still amazing with it's slow-mo shooting mechanics. Total gameplay time is about 10 to 12 hours, it is a little longer than your standard FPS game which is always a plus.

With it's blend of horror and scary moments, along with it's action. This is a winner. At some points of the game, the action does slow down in certain spots, other than that it's a great game and a must play for horror addicts. I give this game a 8.5/10"

Turn off the lights, turn it up a bit more than you normally would, and get ready for a unique gaming experience.  The fighting mechanics are good, the A.I. can become quite challenging, but ultimately, you're going to have sweaty palms - not from the non-stop action - but from the psychological torment you'll feel when you release you don't want to open that door and see what is behind it...."

I would compare F.E.A.R. to the Half-Life games in that there is a great sense of urgency, polish, physics, and linear progression with a fascinating science fiction story.  The bullet time is really fun and the enemy AI is so engaging that each encounter turns out to be a blast.  The only downside to this game is that it rarely shows you anything new and you feel like you are pursuing forward for the sake of padded progression.  However, this is exactly how I felt about the Half-Life series, so if you enjoy those games, please take F.E.A.R. for a spin.

F.E.A.R. is one of the best FPS's of all time. It's tense and the combat is amazing. Only bland environments. Half-Life 1.5 out of 10.

Extraction Point is okay. The gameplay's there, but the story is bad. It opens up a bunch of plot points that could be cool, but go literally nowhere (Paxton Fettle returns from the dead and says ""I know this doesn't make much sense..."" and leaves it at that). The horror is much more in your face but not scary save one or two parts. Half-Life Opposing Force out of 10.

Perseus Mandate is garbage. It feels like a mediocre mod based on horrible fanfiction. The voice acting is bad and they try so hard to make it scary it just becomes laughable. Half-Life Blue Shift out of 10.

Luckily, the expansions come free with the base game on Steam, so I'd still recommend getting the full package (because you can't get the base game on its own).

2. The AI. No other game has ever come close to having as tacticool AI as this; Your enemies feel like real thinking beings.

The jump scares does become a bit old and after a while you only get goosebumps, but thats fun too!
If I'd have to sell this game based on one feature it would be the enemy AI in the game. The way the AI behaves and works together to try and take you down puts games today to shame. Another thing is how fluid your combat can become. Firefights can lasts from a few seconds to a minute and there is never really anything that slows your progress ( cutscenes forexample). The playtime of Perseus Mandate is 7-12 hours, but you can beat in 3 hours on your first playthrough. Perseus Mandate revolves more around combat, than horror compared to the two other games.
Personally I found the plot to be very interesting, although perhaps a bit cliche. If I could change one thing about this game I think it would be the plot. This game could have been story driven had the developers not been afraid to show it. It does however make for a very fun shooter."

F.E.A.R. is a very good game you have to play. It has many creepy suspense moments that will keep you in the moment and on your toes. It has the bullet time slow-motion feature, three 'factions' of enemies to fight and a good story overall. What really stands out in the F.E.A.R. games are the AI behaviour of enemies. Simply amazing. They will use smart tactics to flank you and retreat when needed and camp to ambush you. Do not underestimate the enemy, they are not idiots.
For best effect, play it at night :)



F.E.A.R. - Extraction Point

This expansion is non-canon. 
It mainly revolves around you trying to get out of the ruined city after the events of F.E.A.R. The story is thin in this one. But it makes up for it with plenty of satisfying shooting action.



F.E.A.R. - Perseus Mandate

This expansion is non-canon.

It's almost comedic how much of a relief it can be to run headlong into a horde of cloned troopers that don't hesitate in their attempts to cut you down with military precision, the bullet time at your command serving as a strangely calming intermission between being stalked by a psychic being that does little more than whisper creepy things to your character, with some hallucinations thrown in for good measure.  Speaking of visual deception, somehow the graphical fidelity in this game is even more impressive than on day one, with the clean yet seemingly anachronistic technical limitations of 2005 serving as beauty marks on the ahead-of-its-time Jupiter EX engine.

In short, the gameplay holds up to the test of time. Things that might be glossed over in many ""modern"" shooters, like effective cover use, applying grenades as leverage into enemy-filled rooms rather than a tool for easy kills, and utilizing heavier weapons like precious resources all become prominent necessities to progress and succeed. Air kicking mind-controlled soldiers to death and lasering organic tissue clean off a newly-blackened skeleton are just icing on the gritty cake."

76561198035607013,1357148636,True,"F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon:

Intro:

An absolutely amazing FPS experience full of glorious bloody goodness! If you are a true FPS or horror game admirer, do not miss out on playing this game.
Nothing beats a mad fearguy shooting through a horde of replica soldiers, on his mission to reach Paxton Fettel.
The story is simple and so is your goal, but it doesn’t have to be anything complex, it works and I may go as far to say that it adds a bit to the atmosphere.

Graphic, controls, performance, & sound:

The combat/controls are very decent and so is the graphics of a 2005 game. Exploding bodies with a single shot from shooty is one of the things that always made me giggle in a rather cruel way. I especially like the graphical details of; weapon skins, bullet detail, explosives and fire in general. 
Never had performance issues with this game, but again it’s from 2005; a nowadays low-end pc with a medium-end graphic card shouldn’t have too much trouble running this game.
There is a good amount of sound detail in this game that helps to trick and mislead you in situations of scares. The weapon sound is quality and the combat background music fits in nicely.

Artificial Intelligence:

The AI technology in this game is absolutely amazing; those replica soldiers will run, hide and kite you, like their life were at stake, eh I guess it is against a mad fearguy on the loose!

Overall:

My only dislike was the very similar level stages, but compared to the overall experience and long playtime value, it didn’t really matter to me.
I played this on the PS3. I plan to play it on the PC sometime in the future again on a harder mode. I personally prefer FPS on the PC and would recommend it over playing it on the PS3 - if you’re used to play FPS on the PC.


F.E.A.R. Extraction Point:

I didn’t expect much from this expansion first time I tried it, but color me surprised! It’s more spot on compared to the first one regarding scares, which I found to my liking.

If you enjoyed the first F.E.A.R. and felt like you didn’t get quite enough scares, this one may satisfy your desire on that point.

Alma also takes a larger role in this game as well and may aid you if the situation counts for it.

The weapon armory is very similar compared to F.E.A.R., which I didn’t mind at all, since I like most of the weapons.

The levels were great! A lot of fun and strange stages- Alma playing tricks on you and all that sort of stuff. The playtime value is also decent 6-8 hours depends on how long you spend on looking for goodies."

I played the retail version back in March 2008 and it is really enjoyable with a great balance of suspense/horror and the stylized firefights. As I had done with World in Conflict, the Steam version of F.E.A.R is another great collection to the Steam library. The storyline in the game is rather mediocre, but who cares. Solid gameplay hours of 12-15 hours with highlighted horror and ""John Woo"" killing signatures shine out the most to any gamer. In most honesty, this game (aka the first F.E.A.R) is actually the best out of the trilogy. This is a must buy to anybody who never brought it before. You better buy this game or Chow Yun Fat will shoot you down."
76561198006135085,1356996978,True,"I bought this game off steam because for some reason my CD copy doesnt work anymore. But anyway, I bought the Platinum Collection awhile back, and even though the expansions are non-canon now, they're still a blast to play through. 

The base game however? Best game I've ever played. Amazing shooting mechanics, smart and responsive A.I., very dark and interesting story that doesn't result in just mindless shooting, intense atmosphere and it has some really really good scares. And also, the graphics have aged surprsingly well! I remember at launch this game was a bit of a bitch to run!

If you search around, there IS a way to get the multiplayer working, but it was obviously a lot better when it was still supported. It was super simple multiplayer (TDM, DM, CTF etc.) where you just pick one of 6 extremely well balanced guns and go. Also had incredible maps, dedicated servers, all the things a good multiplayer community needed. Fucking incredible game. 10/10 would play again and again."

76561197975785668,1356404884,True,"It's a sad time when you have a game called FEAR and it's not even scary.

FEAR charts the adventures of Roidirez, a steroid junkie who is attempting to track down his daughter and eliminate his daughter's uncle who is also his son. Along the way the player is attacked by legions upon legions of nameless goons and some fat guy taken from Family Guy the best TV show on at the moment.

Where FEAR falls short is the threat. What kind of threat does a little girl pose? Sadly the game tries to answer this by showing short clips of the little girl (Amy) flying through walls and stuff which I think is meant to be what she dreams of because she dreams of freedom from her oppressive millionaire uncle. In Modern Warfare 2 you get russian plots to nuke the world and steal the white house from the united nations. In FEAR your DAUGHTER is meant to be scary, something I can only attribute to militant feminist propaganda

The level design can get a bit repetitive later around the middle of the game with mazes of boring hallways, but despite that I've got to say its my favorite shooter period. If you haven't played it yet, you really should.

The sequels aren't quite as good, but the original is great.  The combat is unsurpassed.  The enemy A.I. is really good.  The weapons are great.  The story is also pretty good.  FEAR was also one of the first modern games to start the trend of the audio and text logs from long-dead NPCs to expand the narrative and set the stage for the action."

Best played in the dark, at night, with headphones on."
76561197990574293,1356235891,True,"Recently replayed, after reading a discussion on whether FEAR was better than HL2.  I personally think HL2 is better overall, but they're both great games and FEAR excels in areas where HL2 falls short in comparison.

PROS:
Excellent enemy AI
Great pacing
Great enemy encounters
Great lighting
Weapons*
Bullet time mechanic is fun to use (I'M SHOOTING ROCKETS OUT OF THE AIR HOLY SHIT)
Spooky at times (if you're into that)

CONS:
Very linear gameplay
Map design is not great**
Spooky at times (if you're not into that)
The shading has not aged well

* I love the weapons in this game, particularly some of the more unorthodox guns you come across later on.  They all feel appropriately powerful, and bullet impacts kick up dust and blow giant chunks into walls like you would not believe (it is incredibly satisfying).  That being said, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the weapon sounds do not hold up by comparison, especially when compared to the audio from HL2.

** The maps are very labyrinthian; there's only one path from the start of a level to its end, and the path you take between encounters with enemies doesn't make very much sense in a narrative sense.  I frequently forgot where I was supposed to be heading, and relied on the presence of enemies to guage my progress through the level.  Occasionally the path taken will fork, and the player can find extra supplies or upgrades if both routes are explored, but the slow walking speed makes this tedious (routinely, I would walk halfway down one path, and then halfway down the other, until I figured out which one was the critical path).  I can't complain too much, since this is standard for this kind of shooter, but it is still a negative aspect.

Overall its a great game, and if you can overlook the somewhat poor level design you will find a shooter which has aged magnificently."
76561198049677387,1356229198,True,"An amazingly atmospheric game, creates one of the creepiest moods of any game I've played thanks to it using good audio and visual techniques, not just jump scares.

76561198025522237,1356129548,True,Easily the best game in the series. It had a great balance of action and exploring that made me afraid of my own footsteps. I was never mentally prepared to play this game in the dark when I was younger and I still have a hard time doing it today. It's a shame the other two games weren't as good as this one.
76561198000159995,1355730235,True,"Probably the best NPC AI you're ever going to see.

Good weapon selection with high variation, allowing one to pick weapons to set their playstyle accordingly.

The story is a­ss, as is the actual fear factor. If you hit puberty, then it becomes obvious that the writers were trying too hard to make it dark and edgy. 

Even so, buy it if you enjoy first-person, cinema-esque (As in, with action movie motifs weaved into the gameplay, kinesthetics, visual effects, etc, not stupid QTEs and cutscenes every 5 picoseconds) John Woo-style shooters, maybe even the expansion packs.

Don't bother with the sequels.

8/10

Fun fact: This game is the reason why ""cinematic"" qualities were put into modern shooters, such as fully-animated player models seen in games like Battlefield 3."

It's not your typical old-school shoot-em-up since it incorporates a horror subplot  that, even now (late 2012), makes it a lot of fun to play, especially late at night.  Best $2.49 I've spent in years!  Thanks for the fantastic Black November deals, Steam!!!"
76561197972268032,1355104544,True,"A pretty good shooter. Nice weapon balance, and the plot moves along at a fair old clip. Has a near-future feel with clones and biotech, and the nightmare sequences are eerie. There are two DLCs for the first game, and two sequels which I haven't tried yet."
76561198057683223,1354693736,True,"Not horrible. Good time waster, although it gets a little boring and tedious when you pass by the same backgrounds and ""copy/paste"" landscape after awhile.

Remember those cartoons when you were a kid where the cat and mouse would run by the same lamp 20-30 times? Yeah, it's kind of like that.

And there were a few times I found myself wishing the current level would just end already. Some of them went on for too long.

Still, the slow mo feature/power that you have is pretty cool and the AI movement is sort of clever (especially with the things they can randomly say). Good for a few hours if you're looking for a time waster."

The story is nothing like as strong as other FPS games like Bioshock or Metro 2033 and you may get bored listening to other people's ansaphone messages - you can always do the old Ace Ventura, and drop their voices down an octave using slow-mo. Either that, or just shoot the telephones off the table. 

Decent shooter, good AI and lots of blood! Campaign is 5 hours if you're hurrying."

76561198046032800,1351889004,False,"As far as ""fear"", this game's developers must have been 10 years old. The ""scary"" bits are comical at best, and I don't understand the cult following this game seems to have. That said, F.E.A.R. is a solid FPS that seems to ageas well as warm milk. It does introduce some rather interesting FPS mechanics with the ""relex"" slo-mo ability, but nothing that hasn't been done before and better. Fun and good for a casual run or two, and definately worth the 2.49 I paid on sale. No more. My advice: If you want a scare, find a better game; If you want a b-movie level of horror and some interesting FPS mechanics, wait for a sale."

76561198034129721,1351857134,True,this game recommended and the other games this is the scariest shooter ive played since DOOM3 when i was 8 on xbox
76561197984698593,1351839563,True,"FEAR is not a horror game.  Know that going in.  I was led to believe that it was a horror game, and sort of expected it to be one, and this is not the case.  FEAR is basically a straight up shooter, and a pretty good one that manages to make bullet time work in first person and has a decent sense of atmosphere.  The story, while nothing special, is well told, and the gameplay is definitely fun if you like balls-to-the-wall action games. 

That said, it is never scary, tense, unnerving, or any of the other things you might expect it to be from the press and the way people talk about it.  It's horror the way the Resident Evil movies are horror (it isn't)."
76561197992700808,1351705385,True,"The game isn't so scary, but it does have some scary moments here or there. Why would you buy this game then? Because the gunplay is extremely satisfying. I mostly used shotgun + slow motion throughout and had a ton of fun blasting people in half. It's on sale now for $2.50, and if you haven't played it, I'd say pick it up."
76561198037789904,1351165968,True,"I'm not much of a fan of horror, mostly because it's pretty much turned into torture porn. But this game is different, I'm a fan of psychological horror and this game makes tasteful use of it. There were times I was disturbed by what they we're showing in the game and it actually made me appreciate and think about the story. Unfortunately, the sequels aren't exactly the same in awesomeness. The sequel F.E.A.R 2 was okay but it focused a little too much on shooting and not enough scares. And don't get me started on F.E.A.R. 3. Anyway, this is one of my favorite games ever. And for the price, it's pretty great considering that it comes with the expansion packs."
76561198042317352,1351133191,True,"FEAR is actually a really good FPS that holds up really well today. Its a great break from the mindless military shooters out there. This game actually has a very interesting story and will scare you at times. Im about 8 hours in and there hasnt been too many scary moments but when there is, they will make you jump! I always try to use my flashlight during some of the scary parts but in some cases they disable the flashlight and use this noir film grain to really creep you out. As a shooter im actually really surprised how much I love this game. It seems this game is either loved or hated and I love it. The AI is actually pretty smart, calling out postion or ordering out moves like ""He's behind the table"" ""Flank right"" ""Regroup"" and flipping over tables or pulling down cabinets for cover. There is a slow mo feature but I havent really used it. There are some puzzles too and hidden areas. Very Fun game!"

It was one of the most powerful games of it's time, and still holds up as an emotional and involving piece second to only that of Half-life. Either from it's chilling atmosphere to it's deep, involving story to it's rock-solid combat, this game will thrill you to the core, and you will finish it feeling emotionally drained and deeply satisfied.

And the expansions? They're alright. Extraction Point focused more on the horror and tenseful atmospheres, while Perseus Mandate was mostly about the gun fights and hard pumping action. Take your pick on which one to go through first after beating the first game, as it doesn't really matter."

The action is designed to feel Tactical yet over-the-top badass at the same time, and it actually pulls it off. It has an intruiging yet difficult to follow plot with some pretty cool ideas. The one negative thing I could say about it is that it isn't really scary. Not even close to what is out there now, like Amnesia. Still, a fun game.
I recommend buying this game or at least trying the singleplayer Demo that is on the internet."

By keeping scares to subtle changes with sharp painful twinges in the music with an occasional glimpse of the ever so elusive Alma, there was definitely a decent horror element in this game. The guns are satisfying to use and so is the handy slo-mo ability you can activate. By paying attention to phones, and laptops there is an interesting backstory to an already great plot. The shooting can feel samey in locations, and the locations seem to repeat themselves alot giving a sense of copy and paste but the game is worth it. 8.5/10 Buy it and play it, skip out the expansion packs however."

76561197970735557,1345000695,True,"This game is famed for its spooky atmosphere, which all these years later is somewhat underwhelming, mostly for two reasons: there's too much ""wasn't it great back in Half-Life how you got to explore loads of empty corridors and basements?"", and the plot seems to imply that you're kind of on the side of the scares, so they stop targeting you for a good chunk of the game. Fortunately, this game is also famed for its slo-mo gun combat, which is, make no mistake, still fucking excellent. Even after ten or eleven hours it's not boring at all to charge into a room and blast everyone into hanging gardens of particles while they're still emitting pitch-shifted howls and trying to snap off a shot. I'm not sure why I find this so hypnotic while the Max Paynes did nothing to grab me, and yet. So for the combat, highly recommended, but it comes at a sizeable cost of ""ffs, how long do I have to spend rooting around in this damn Armachem building"" and other such protests."

Sure you can fault it for the repetitiveness of its enemies and environments, but the enemies are so intelligent you probably won't notice it so much and the environments needed to be repetitive because horror doesn't really work well if the environment drastically changes every 30 minutes.  Overall it is an amazing piece of work that still manages to outclass most modern shooters in the AI department."

Scary story, decent AI, robots, angry little girls and bloody walls!  That's F.E.A.R. in a nutshell.  Let's not forget the SloMo technique.  That shit is fun!  Walk in a room minding your own business then BAM! Now, you're surrounded... But what's this?  SloMo ftw!  Not to say it doesn't have it's faults.  The scripting in the game is terribad.  IE: If you walk up a ladder and there's 2 hallways and you look down the left, but the event was on the right.. well, you're fucked and missed out.  Hopefully this is fixed in future installments of the series.  The game does come with two DLC's that's about 5 hours each.  In comparison the main game is 10 hours long.  The DLC is all about the action and less story while the main game is the opposite.  Still, it's a fun game and worth a look ON SALE. :p"
76561198031018779,1343987246,True,"Very scary, and although the level design does become a tad tedious (and trite...office blocks...), it is a technically impressive game which I recommend to every PC gamer. The pacing is excellent and it is chock full of scare tactics, along with some genuinely enjoyable gameplay, thanks to the Max Payne-esque bullet-time, and the weapon variety. Although unfortunately the download is humongous (16 FREAKING GIGABYTES FOR A GAME FROM 2005!!!), and the enemy variety is a bit...not varied...that should not be enough to deter you from this excellent horror first-person shooter from the folks at Monolith. Oh and stay away from little girls.

76561198047849951,1343901322,True,Scary as hell but you need a good computer to run it.

76561198023648319,1343685598,True,An awesome Classic! I wouldn't say this is the scariest game to me because I'm so used to scary games anyway but it's very very creepy. The storyline is very unique and there is a lot of twists and forshadowing. F.E.A.R. is like Half Life  the horror version. It's also not very linear but there isn't a different outcome. There just happens to be several ways to get from Point A to Point B. F.E.A.R also includs two expansions for free which are seperate games in your steam library. The game used to have multiplayer but it was removed a while ago. You can still get it elsewhere on the internet and it still has an active community.
76561198046553476,1343589575,True,Alma is one scary girl. Try not to remember The Ring!

76561198010291484,1343284955,True,"I love this game. Great FPS action blended with Resident Evil atmosphere. It sort of reminds one of the movie ""The Ring."" It's main protagonist, the eerie ""Girl"", will have you playing this game with the lights on. It's pure bliss. When this game was released, very few people could run it on max settings as it ate systems for lunch. The game was so intensive with it's realism and destructive enviroments that the game included a built-in Benchmark tool so you could tweak your settings. Now, in the age of Windows 7 64bit...this gem REALLY shines. I crank this baby up and have a ball. The use of your super quick reflexes in game to ""Slow Down Time"" is key to the survival of the main protagonist. The story is excellent. Word of warning though: This game deals with cannablism and very mature subject manner and language....so you have been warned. But....it's rock solid."

What really sucked me into this game was the music and sound effects. The music and sound really just set the atmosphere perfectly for me, it was timed perfectly. The different times the music would change depending on where i was just had me sucked in. Definitely gave the whole game its spooky feeling.

The storys cool, vague but interesting. 

I love the slow motion ability, it really grants the possibility of some awesome screenshots. =)
I think if you enjoy shooters that you should enjoy this one even so far after its release. I sure did.

And why the crap are there crows everywhere? lol Its awesome. =)"
76561198004174970,1343079538,True,Best PC shooter mechanic so far.
76561198062164788,1342991192,True,"The game that started the resurgent horror/action game trend. I'm not going to pretend it's perfect, never really achieving scary and instead settling for something more around ""Spookhouse"". But the story is what makes it, being a genuinely disturbing tale on a personal level, and being a highly feasible (albeit with psychics) warning about big company politics.

One of its biggest highlights and at the same time greatest hamperings is its gunplay. Tight, accurate, fun, and blisteringly fast compared to the average FPS it’s just pure good times, and the slo-mo mechanic is probably the best ever implemented. However, the fact that you feel like a walking god is one of the aspects that goes a long way to draining the, er...fear out of the game.

Not the best horror title in the world, but still swings towards ""eerie"" enough to count, and easily comparable gameplay to many modern shooters. Check it out...you know…..if that sounds remotely interesting."

76561198026924921,1342654659,True,"well what can i say? F.E.A.R is just one of those unique blends, combining tactical FPS with horror elements (psycological mind you, rather than doom 3's RAWRS IZ JUMPZ AT YOUZ) the gameplay is awsome as it urges you to keep out of the line of fire and has a slo mo mechanic which can help you out in the thickest of firefight's or if some dude is around the corner ready to blast your face plus the AI is also very aware as thay adapt their tatics based on the situation. the graphics are actually detailed for it's time using high detailed textures and some soft dynamic shadows in areas (it dosen't look as plasticy too *looks at doom 3) also this game will scare you mentally (as psycological horrors do)  some may not grasp what's going on at times. but other than that i recomend this fine game."
76561198001092341,1342647117,True,"When trying and utterly failing at being scary, F.E.A.R makes up for it by being one of the best FPS games out there. I'd personally say the biggest reason as to why is the kinesthetics of it all, everything has such a fantastic punch to it, and everything is fun to kill. Gameplay design wise it's not the post innovative, and is essentially a corridor shooter, but it does so well based alone on how everything is presented. I mean, you go into slow-mo, throw a grenade at a group of clones shouting TARGETSPAHTED and you watch them fly into several directions, busting the walls and casuing some occasionally nice smoke and debri effects.

Also the SPAS-12 shotgun can literally turn enemies into mists of blood, so there is that."
76561198029149345,1342638463,True,Good game i love it <3
76561197992827421,1342567833,True,"This was a pretty good game. It's a really good shooter and I like the slow mo power your character could enable thanks to his enhanced flexes. It was fun taking out a room full of soldiers in slow mo before they can take a shot at you, and hear they say ""He's too fast for us."" The story is pretty good too. At times you can get a pretty good jump from something scary jumping at you. The AI was pretty good and would actually try to flank you. It woudln't be uncommon for you to end up having enemies sneak up on you from behind. There is a decent assortment of weapons, each which are effective against certain types of units. The graphics are still decent. I played this before, longer than the time listed on this account. I would give it a 9/10."
76561197998744534,1342556316,True,"The best ""forgotten"" shooter of the past decade is FEAR. Lost in all the Call of Duty franchise hype, FEAR is a very pollished game with incredible balance of suspense and combat.  The story is intense and evolves deeper as you play, aided by great environments, enemies and unique weapons. FEAR is high on presentation and has innovative gameplay elements that are used in current FPS titles.  A classic for many years to come and it does not require a beefy CPU and GPU.  I have played dozens of games and this comes highly recommended."
76561197970655001,1342504622,True,"I'll include 2 comments along with this one, each reviewing the different FEAR games.

FEAR basic:
50% action, 50% horror.  The game mostly deals in shock scares, some you'll miss, some will really scare the pants off of you.  The game has some of the smartest AI I've ever seen, with a game length of, oh, 12 hours or more?  I only completely beat it once, back when I had to install it using 5 seperate discs.

The Slo-Mo feature isn't just a gimmick they used for this, it actually is a gameplay feature.  In some firefights it would be suicide to not use it, because the enemies react just as fast as you do, flank, throw grenades, communicate, dodge, and can wipe out large portions of your health in mere seconds.

Really a great FPS, one of my all-time favorites."
76561197978232684,1342491936,True,"FPS meets Psychological horror. The Gunning parts aren't so scary, but then you'll be walking down a poorly lit hallway, a shadowy figure slowly walks across a hallway, your heart stops."

76561197996337340,1342239056,True,"A game published in 2005, but playing it in 2012 is still a pleasent and scary experience. No relying on throwing zombie heads in your face out of a sudden, it is often the little shadow that you got a glimpse of at the corner of you eye that keeps you paranoid for the next 10 minutes of play.

While terrifying, the shooting department is just as solid, if not better than many FPS nowadays. The more or less constant pacing of the game may leave you a bit unimpressed, but the game has more than enough tricks to keep you engaged overall."
76561197996086549,1342219260,True,"F.E.A.R. is easily one of the best FPS made in the last decade. The audio is amazing, it is very nice visually and it has some of the best gunfights in a game. If you see yourself as a fan of the FPS genre than you need this game. It is that simple."

76561198021876026,1342023361,True,"My favorite game of all time, F.E.A.R combines action and horror that is purely unique and can never be recreated. 

You take the role of First Encounter Assault Recon's Pointman where the mission is to kill a man named Paxton Fettel. The problem is that Fettel contains special psychic abilities that allows him to control an army of super soldiers called replicas. From there you are left to discover the dark secret behind the PMC Armacham and the truth behind Pointman. 

There are a large variety of guns to chose, from the traditional assault rifle to a more futuristic sniper rifle that burns the flesh off of an enemy. Pointman has the power to use ""bullet-time"" that adds a whole new layer to the game as you use to flank enemies or even shoot your own grenades out of the air. The AI is extremely smart and makes it a real challenge on higher difficulties. 

The biggest draw of F.E.A.R is, well, fear. The game is very scary and instead of cheap jumpscares, the game takes the approach of a more psychological horror game. Even after playing the game over and over again, I still get chills every time something happens.

Amazing story, outstanding gameplay, and the best horror experience since Silent Hill 2, F.E.A.R is a must have game. It even comes with both expansion packs."
76561197971397487,1341663709,True,"Absolutely amazing. The story is delivered well, and the gunfight playstyle of the game is very refreshing.

76561198025362073,1341523114,True,"Decent shooter with acceptable AI and entertaining bullet-time-elements. Some genuinely good horror-elements, but don't believe it's a horror game: While the flickering lights and mood-bits are fun, it's you vs a squad of mooks 95% of the time."

The shooting mechanics are good, but the gameplay is pretty straight forward and doesn't offer much in the way of variety. Most of the weapons are boring. The graphics hold up pretty well by today's standards.

The DLC campaigns (Extraction Point, Perseus Mandate) are just more of the same, with a couple new enemies/weapons/etc. Not canon, not worth playing."

But
What this game does reeeeally well, is the combat
The average combat loop can play out a couple dozen different ways if you quick save and reload after the fight, the A.I. is very dynamic and aggressive, they are also coded to act as a team unit pretty well, one might flank your left while two go right as one is drawing your attention from the front, they don't just find the nearest cover and take random pot shots.

(2005) is an action-packed, old school FPS with excellent graphics (which still look great despite its age), ominous music that adds tension, a creepy atmosphere, fun gunplay with movie-like effects, and level design reminiscent of Half-Life and FarCry (indoors). F.E.A.R. is better than its mediocre expansions, Extraction Point (EP) and Perseus Mandate (PM), which are both shorter in length and can each be completed in under 5 hours (PM was the better of the two expansions). I also liked F.E.A.R. better than its two sequels (which were still fun and will appeal to F.E.A.R. fans). Widescreen resolutions in EP require editing the following file:

This things got bullet time, the best AI I've ever seen, Mechs, awesome enemies, awesome weapons, horror, and a creepy little girl with long black hair that scares the shit outta you. I can replay this one many times (and already have)."
76561197970739339,1329345600,True,"Many years ago after first getting an Xbox 360, I grabbed F.E.A.R. and Gears of War of a shelf of a Circuit City one day, thinking they both looked fun. Gears is fun, sure, enough that I went on to play the rest of the 360 installments with a friend in coop, even Judgement, but that's another story.

At that time, I had never even heard of F.E.A.R., much less did I know that it had been on PC first- I would not play the PC version until this Steam release. But I've now played through each installment in the series multiple times, and this one more then the others. I also did not know back then that F.E.A.R. was from the same studio that brought us the Build Engine classic, Blood, which I now consider to be the best of the original Build ""Holy Trinity."" In fact, I hadn't played Blood back then either. But that's also another story.

F.E.A.R. turned out to be I think, one of my favorite singleplayer FPSes ever. It's certainly the best FPS to come out of the 00's, otherwise an indisputable low point in FPS and game history in general. It's not really the gameplay that stands out to me now, though it has aged quite well in comparison to its contemporaries. The extremely useful and satisfying slow-motion reflex ability set it apart from other FPSes of the time, rather then feeling like it was cribbing from Max Payne, combined with the psychological horror elements gave F.E.A.R. an identity all its own, far from the drab and formulaic milsim its art style might suggest it to be.

Despite the fact that you can carry only three guns, which is still better then two, the encounter design, damage model, and forgiving healing system that allows you to carry a stack of medkits around with you, is still very much grounded in the design sensibilities of the 90s- and its a tad more balanced by comparison. And it has simply one of the best shotguns in the genre, bar none. In fact, almost all of F.E.A.R.s weapons sound and feel satisfying to use, especially in slow-mo.

Enemies are dangerous and numerous and talk with a cool radio filter, and fight intelligently, using tactics that put many modern shooters to shame- or at least, they feel smarter then their programming would suggest. The visual effects and environmental scarring well reflect the intensity of your battles. The music is supremely atmospheric, occasionally sounding almost Indian, and eerily jiving with the gameplay despite no other thematic link thereof. 

A trailer for the PC version once asked, ""Do you know the true meaning of fear?"" And at the game's end, I believed I had a credible answer. What set F.E.A.R. apart from almost any other FPS of the ""oughts"" for me was its story and feel, regardless of what Civvie 11 thinks. Even without any of that it would be a very fun single-player FPS, but the sheer creep factor made me replay it again and again. Monolith created an enemy both terrifying and sympathetic, brutal and supremely tragic in the mysterious Alma. I can tell you very little here without spoilers, but Alma was to me among the most compelling antagonists of any media I know of. F.E.A.R. might not scare most people, since it is at its core a series of Matrix-like gun battles and jump scares, but it added up to so much more then that. Doom 3 tought me that monsters in a closet can't do more then spook you for a second if you've got a gun to answer them with, but F.E.A.R. managed to have a persistently unsettling and oppressive atmosphere throughout regardless. You are a nigh-unstoppable hyper-reflex gun-toting badass, and you are STILL in over your head. THAT is atmosphere.

The average shooter player may not be afraid of a little ghost girl, especially when that has become such a common element in horror media. But that's not the point- what SHE is afraid of is the true horror: Loss, entrapment, abandonment.  Sewers, maintenance corridors and empty warehouses, and office cubicles might not be scary. What can be absolutely terrifying is your own painful memories and the shadows they cast on your present and your future.

There are logical explanations for everything that follows, but I think ultimately, it is a question of hatred. F.E.A.R. may not be for everyone. But I found it to be both an excellent shooter and a compelling exercise in self-reflection."
76561197989425055,1328651966,True,Scary and all around fun and exciting game :)
76561197979075201,1328148103,True,"Almost 7 years later and F.E.A.R. still holds up. The level design is a little repetitive, especially later in the game, but slowing down time and blasting fools in half never, ever gets old. A PC gaming classic."
76561198001047882,1328045745,True,"Awesome game but is too easy, however it is so important to the story so you better get this for the follow ups that make Fear what it is all about"
76561198008530728,1327992701,True,"If you have not played this game and all of the games in the series. You are depriving yourself of one of the most intricate storylines, teeth gnashing, jump out of you're chair and mess yourself games and series of all time.

This take horror gaming back to the golden days of horror movies, subtle, or sudden freights, never sure what's real and whats not.  scrounging for ammo and medicals.  Whispers over your shoulder, shouts down the hall. Simply TRUE horror."
76561197968514637,1327886478,True,"Excellent game for it's time. Graphics are ok by todays standards. Has some scary moments, but it really wasn't too bad. Horrible repeating environments though. Corridor shooter"
76561197963562298,1327811867,True,"Games are like a box of chocolates. You never quite know what you'll get. Have you ever found yourself playing what you thought was an ""average"" game, only to discover later that it offers some of the most brilliant features you've ever seen? Or perhaps you've found yourself playing a much hyped game, only to realize what a disappointment it really is. Of the two categories, F.E.A.R. triumphantly stands in the former.

A weak story and repetitive gunplay aside, it is the A.I. in this game that ties the atmosphere together. The fact that your enemies intelligently respond to your actions added an unprecedented level of tension.

Unfortunately, F.E.A.R.'s multiplayer component included in its initial release has since been shut down. If you're looking for a competitive experience, look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for something unpredictable in its challenge and exhilarating in its frights, with A.I. unsurpassed to this very day, then this gem may just be it.

Grade: A"
76561198036162044,1327702947,True,"   To simplify any confusion about this game, it should be written somewhere on this title that it does not actually contain much fear. The pretty shadows and lighting are good, the animations and the AI are enough to warrant buyer's curiosity itself, and the story is structured enough to desire a sequel. 
   But the mechanic FEAR seems to honestly have the most trouble with is being interesting. A year after HL2 and several years after Deus Ex, and this game can't be bothered to throw in anything fun. The lack of level variety, the sore exclusion of any exploration besides trivial stat boosters, and the story that tries to pique your attention ends up requiring copious time and energy to dive into. Guns are balanced but the game decides when you can/can't enjoy them, and instead of featuring a sprint button it has a button that can slow you down.
   Buy it for the enjoyment of its shooting sequences; forget it for its apathetic attitude about anything outside of ""pew-pew."""
76561197993378071,1327654389,True,"""A-"" A solid shooter with bullet time fun.  Shooting action is swapped back and forth with spooky parts in  ""The Grudge"" scary girl style.  Not the scariest but still a little tense and guaranteed to get you to jump at least once."

76561197981173361,1327043910,True,"Why are the batteries for the flashlight so incredibly bad!

Well, this game does what it is advertised to do. It instills fear, and it does it with style. The times I have jumped at the slightest environmental noise, the times I have emptied entire mags in anticipation.

I recommend playing this game in the dark, with headphones on and not turning down the volume too much. In fact, I dare you."

76561198038342500,1326687796,True,这个是我接触的第一款恐怖类的第一人称射击游戏。虽然说剧情简单，路也不绕，但是闪现的吓人镜头以及突然出现在面前的ALMA还是在第一次游戏的时候给了我不小的惊悚。背景音乐也不错，特别是片头动画那段，伴随着ALMA的脚印，主角的弟弟受了她的召唤，突然做崩溃状，几只乌鸦受惊飞起，然后画面一转，到了FEAR准备前往事发地点前那里，给人很强的带入感，不出什么意外的话，玩家都会在这里做一下心理准备，料想自己将要面临什么样的考验。记住，这是一款在气氛上能给人深刻印象的游戏。DLC做得也相当好，而且免费。在WIN7上可以完美运行，这点也不用担心。最后，这款游戏我通了三遍。

76561197997663212,1325407374,True,"As a shooter that came out 11 years ago, this game has good mechanics, interesting A.I. and a wide variety of weapons and techniques (CQC is complex. You can punch, you can flying-kick, you can slide-kick...)

As a storyteller, you'll find a mystery to be solved, surrounded by plot twists and a lot of names (VIPS with something to hide). Scenarios, sound effects, visuals... It's an inmersive experience. This aspect is also pretty dinamic: there are few cutscenes. You're the actor. Your eyes are the camera, and you should pay attention to your surroundings or you won't last long nor know much. Labtops, phone messages... Look for them."

Only thing I don't like is how the multiplayer isn't on steam. But they released the multiplayer for free anyways so it isn't like you have to pay extra!"
76561197960805204,1325116482,True,"A pretty decent FPS; however it relies a bit too much on its bullet-time gimmick (which was already old when the game came out) and its scares aren't really, uhm, scary."
76561198008147660,1325108714,True,"I picked this game up cheap in the F.E.A.R. collection pack that included the two expansions for this game, and it's sequel - F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin. 

I played through this game in about a week and it did have a few scares up its sleeve and all the while I was having fun blasting away evil clone soldiers and using my slo-mo power.

The game has a unique story and was scary to me at a few points. The gameplay is fantastic because of the slow-mo power and the ability to upgrade your health and slow motion duration throughout the game. I recommend buying the F.E.A.R. pack in order to get this great game and it's sequel.
"
76561197993967974,1325090720,True,"Love the shootouts, nice graphics, great story. Worth buying even without a discount!"
76561198014193660,1325074499,True,"This is the first F.E.A.R, which is in my opinion slightly better as the masterpiece: F.E.A.R 2. Which means, well: that it's fuckin' good! This game is famous of his scary single-player.. and i have no doubt about that at all!

It features one of the scariest single-players i've ever played. I'm not familiar with all the 90's horror games or the real horror games nowadays (except for Outlast and Amnesia) and i believe there are games which are a lot scarier then this one but it still scared the shit out of me back in the day i've played this.

To take a break, i've decided to play the multiplayer of F.E.A.R and it amazed me. It's highly addictive and not just some trash multiplayer which some games with a good single-player have. (for example: Tomb Raider - 2013)

I would reccomend to buy this game and his DLC's also, they're all great. If you pee and poop in your pants, i've warned you, because you will! Unless you're Chuck Norris."
76561198039051294,1325072007,True,F.E.A.R is a game that brings horror to new height. When I bought this game I did not expect to get so much value for my money! Great game! This is one of those games a fanatic gamer should have in his collection.
76561198005149427,1325060570,True,First Encounter Assault Recon is a great first-person shooter with great action and some genuinely scarry moments and some not so genuinely scary moments (jump scares and stuff). With an OK plot and great gameplay this is a good game. Buy it if it is on sale (especially in a pack along with F.E.A.R. 2)

76561197977450814,1325015981,True,"One of my most favorite shooters where every aspect of the game was done perfectly.

The horror is actually palpable with Alma making me sh!t my pants on that ladder area.
Bullet time with the assortment of cool available guns is visceral where you can't get enough of the action.
Not to mention that the AI; if you actually analyze their behavior make them one of the best AI enemies to grace gaming for its time.

76561197979445690,1324875861,True,"A classic psychological horror first-person corridor shooter.  At launch FEAR PC requirements were staggering. Today the engine still puts out some impressive graphics, lighting and shadows.  One would be hard pressed to find better combat even in modern shooters.  A nice variety of guns and melee techiques are at the players disposal.  Animation is over the top with tremondous unprecedented detail given to how enemies react to bullets, grenades and melee damage. The engine paints their blood on surfaces with a liberal brush and blows their bodies apart better than any other I can remember.  Excellent sound, a well implemented slo motion mechanic (that you can disable, good luck) and good physics compliment a wonderful combat engine.  Correctly criticized for repetive level design however FEAR leads with communications that tell a horrific tale of psychological horror.  The combat never gets old and there's that need to see what's around the next corner."
76561198004125261,1324779205,True,"The original and the best. You can snatch up a free copy of the multiplayer, joinfear.com but be warned the cdkey generator does NOT work anymore, meaning you'll have to hunt around online to find a multiplayer key (search for: FEAR Combat cd key, good luck).

I personally preordered this game, full price, and still don't regret it; the story was great, the graphics were ahead of its time and the multiplayer was probably one of the fastest paced I'd played at the time. The multiplayer numbers are far from what they used to be, and a server in Aus which is populated, let alone full, is hard to come by. That said, I still recommend grabbing this game if you see it cheap, play through the story on easy, even, just to get your money's worth. Finding populace online is a bonus.

Oh and I see it comes with the expansion packs? I've not played through them, so I can't comment. Heard nothing but good things, though (except for the multiplayer)."

76561197991415564,1324350259,True,"Want a game that involves you and scares you but still want a game where you can kill crap? You can get that in one epic package. While the competitive multiplayer has been shut down, the single-player campaign is incredibly strong. With a powerful story that will captivate horror fans right off the bat and interest fans of first-person shooters, you will stick with this game from beginning to end. The slow-motion is great fun to take advantage of as you shred your foes apart, limb from limb, with automatic weaponry, or turn them to a thick mist with your shotgun, or pin them to walls with a rifle that launches steel stakes.

You play your typical silent protagonist, but you'll quickly learn that his ability to slow time is not a feature of First Enounter Assault Recon soldiers possess. It's unique to him, and you'll find out more about Pointman that is unique and while all these horrible events are happening.

While the DLC has been removed from the canon of the series, they're still fun.

76561198035811313,1324348482,True,"Ahhh now here's a good game! F.E.A.R at first glance looks fairly standard shooter fair and for the most part it is. However it's a well made standard shooter with the shooting feeling pretty solid. Also the slow-motion reflex ability greatly enhances the fun of the game, however some people may find issue with it as there's an over reliance on this mechanic. Only a handful of times did I engage enemies without the slo-motion ability and that was due to not being able to wait for it to recharge.  The AI stands out as being rather intelligible compared to other shooters as they try to flank you, flush you out and navigate cover fairly well. Whilst the horror elements are fairly nice and creepy, they don't really elevate beyond that and never really become scary. Also the level design is bland and uninspired with the majority of the game being set in either a warehouse or an office area. But overcome it's shortcomings and you can enjoy it as a solid and fun first person shooter."

76561197988931399,1323495299,True,"A decent, but also plain shooter in my opinion, reminded me of Half Life, but with a horror slant. However, I didn't find anything in FEAR especially creepy and the story, largely told through drab voice mails on phones, was both confusing and actually killed a lot of the drama. I expected the enemies to evolve into a more diverse bunch, but they never really did, instead you're gunning down loads of clone soldiers and corporate mercs, which after awhile got rather dull. Level designs were also confusing in places, but I don't regret buying the game when it was on sale or playing it through. The final moments were pretty cool, even considering the game's age."

I got the OLD franchise and will get F.E.A.R. III after I complete these. 

Long story... I bought this game when it first came out, was very excited about playing. 
I accidentally returned the game inside an internal CD player when I read it had to be played on a DVD player. 
When I returned the internal drive back to Best Buy, I gave them back the game. WTF? Oops! 
I am glad to be playing it, finally."
76561198021396355,1322210830,True,This game has a great blend of horror and FPS. The story is also interesting to follow. It is true horror in the fact that the horror is mainly created from the anticipation and the atmosphere rather than things jumping around corners(although there is a bit of that). Reccomended if you like this kind of blend of genres.

Bullet time gunplay from Max Payne, living storytelling from half-life, creepy girl from The Shining, and some mild puzzling, all comes together so well you can almost forgive it for being so god damned linear. It gave way for similarly creepy games like Dead Space (linear) and Bioshock (audiobooks).
And let's just talk about the AI for a second. WOW. Creative, smart, tough, and not cheap. The weapons are pretty standard with some unique ones.
I'm looking forward to going through both expansions (included w/ steam version of F.E.A.R.) and F.E.A.R. 2 too. Multiplayer is shut down fyi."

76561198007019280,1319173769,True,best horror shooter game and a very great story. F.E.A.R. ( first encounter assault recon) is the best part. Fear 2 and 3 sucks.
76561197991349902,1318688090,True,Office Space as told by a silent protagonist.
76561197986570063,1317909504,True,"F.E.A.R Is one of the best games i've ever played, buy that shit, nig."
76561198010396848,1317796150,True,Impressive A.I. No longer will the enemies just sit there waiting for you to poke your head out. If they know you're waiting somewhere the enemies will look for alternate ways and come flanking. They will also talk to each other and other enemies will respond to that call. This game's A.I. component was way ahead of their time.
76561198028769586,1317585005,True,Half-Life mixed with The Grudge with slow-mo function combat.  Playing for long stretches of time without seeing alma keeps things tense instead of becoming tedious.
76561198034444591,1317013159,True,"Warning: just play this is you need a very strong laxative, you will shit your pant, I promise. The action is great too, same for the expansions."
76561197980364462,1316888472,True,"Scary as fuck, excellent AI, expansions were fine (story made more sense than F.E.A.R. 2), and has free multiplayer even without owning F.E.A.R. Also Nailgun is awesome."
76561197971263130,1315940893,True,"If you like Matrix-style gunfights and sprawling indoor levels, get this game right frickin now.

Story sucks but the action will entertain you."
76561198018979559,1315543481,True,"The U.S. version of the Steam store packs the original F.E.A.R. and both its expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. Although the expansion packs are not officially canon, they are still entertaining and utilize the same mechanics as the first game. F.E.A.R. looks, feels, sounds and plays great. Certainly, one of the best first-person shooters to date, F.E.A.R. has aged well with its unique ""slow-mo"" feature that is similar to ""bullet time"" from the Matrix movies. It should be noted that there is an outstanding bug with the game that conflicts with some gaming mice (most notable Logitech) that destroys the game's frame rate after a prolonged gaming session. There are a couple of known workarounds."

76561198002241050,1314487892,True,"Not for those with a weak heart, only game that has ever made me jump in my chair. Has adaptive A.I. & is interesting to play through some points multiple times to see how the A.I. changes to the situation.
Twin pistols + slo-mo is always fun (Matrix anyone :P ), as is the rifle that fires metal stakes."
76561197961731704,1314064386,True,"Updated 2014:  This game, including DLC, has the best/creepiest atmosphere of any FPS Ive played since the original Half Life was released and in that regard it is actually better.  The game engine is a little clunky dated now, but the atmosphere still stands up.  This one is still worth playing getting on to near a decade later.

Both DLCs now come with the game.  Extraction Point is a continuation of the original game, though the engine seems to have regressed with no native widescreen resolution support.  That is easily remedied by editing the cfg file. 

Project Origin is a side story to the game and other DLC.  You are a part of a separate FEAR team sent in the Armacham facility on a reconnaissance / data collection mission in parrallel with team #1.

The overall story here is execellent.  Use of what now seems to be a pretty dated game engine still holds up to make you jump in your seat.

Play in the dark, with headphones on, on a harder difficulty and I guarantee you will shit yourself a few times playing through this content."
76561197984756417,1313918064,True,"This game must be played on Extreme Difficulty, this game offered a great gameplay experience, was very challenging and ultimately fun, also some cut scenes shit scared me."

76561198006238716,1313534072,True,"What can I say?
One of the Best FPS and Horror game in history!
AI of enemis is (along with FEAR 2) still unbeatable.
Effects of graphics and physics are stunning, that is how game should look!
Story of the game is interesting and shrouded in mystery.
Alma,Fettel and other creatures will cause you heart attack all the time xD
If you will buy this game you received a four games!! - F.E.A.R. (11 hours), FEAR Extraction Point (4 hours), FEAR Perseus Mandate (6hours) and FEAR Combat(Free Multiplayer) 
MP of this game is very original and I assure you that you have never played anything like this before! And it's still very popular
All this just for few bucks.It's MUST HAVE title."
76561198032503176,1313346075,True,"After playing near enough half way through the Campaign I can safely say that FEAR is a game to play.
If you enjoy FPS/Horror Style gameplay then FEAR should be on your list of games.
With decent Graphics, Easy to use controls, Challenging Combat and an interesting story line FEAR will keep you on the edge of your seat and may even make you jump out of it!
Overall Good Game and worth the purchase 7/10."
76561197993314877,1313190898,True,"the scare tactics seem a bit dated, yet still loads of fun"
76561198036113867,1313152766,True,Its Not Scary. Just Dam Hard.
76561197964546098,1312912413,True,This game will have you in cold chills most of the time and yelping once in a while.  First in the series.
76561197961256488,1312061280,True,"Frightful, genious and SCARY as hell. Very rarely have I played a game that said it would scare the living daylights out of me, and did. This one does. Well worth playing."

76561197973382668,1311860109,True,A well made addon  for  a great game
76561198001939665,1311797370,True,"F.E.A.R or First Encounter Assault Recon is legitimately one of the best Horror FPS games that we have ever been blessed with; there's a slew of wonderful mooks to shoot and a deadly arsenal of cool weapons to shoot them with. Intersperse that with some occasional spookies and you have a horror FPS title that is still one of the greats.

Full thoughts on my retrospective below:

https://youtu.be/-zAoVPcg7Ow"
76561197998822702,1311643184,True,"Loved the game and the Slo-Mo definetly Play this, will Scare you!"
76561197971249149,1311562918,True,"Holy crap. Talk about huge repetitive levels. Awesome ambiance during the scary parts of the storyline though.

It's a fun game....but just be prepared for a game that streches the story...on...and on...and on...and on....and on....and on.

Oh yea, and if you ever wanted to play a game where you answered everyones voice mail in an office building....this is what you've been waiting for. The purpose of answering blinking phones is to progress the storyline but holy crap it's redundant.

That said, I will beat this game....someday."
76561197982708568,1311428024,True,"Scary game, even playing it through a second time I find new places to get freaked out. Awesome music sets up a great atmosphere. Old school shooter mechanics too for the most part. Slow-mo is just the way to have a firefight."
76561197981137957,1311349007,True,"To this day, I can not play this game in the dark.  This game has a spectacularly bizarre story and scares the crap out of me.  A memorable experience.  Worth playing."
76561198043552873,1311272947,True,One of the scariest games I've ever played. Fairly easy to pick up but not easy to get through. I do love a challenge and this game definitely gave it to me.
76561197969534433,1311269882,True,"This game came out in 2005, is made with arguably the worst FPS engine (after Doom 3's), has some of the easiest maps, contains the dumbest adversaries, gives you nothing less than particle beams and bullet-time to defend yourself with and yet after having played through many, many times, it still manages to make me shit myself."
76561197967372886,1311233136,True,"The only game I've ever played that has made me jump and go WTF? all at the same time, It's a old now but I'd hold it up there with half-Life 1.
If you like your Japanesse Horror films like The Ring, The Grudge, etc.. then this is a game you MUST play."
76561197978076508,1311044543,True,"One of the BEST FPS's I've ever played. Along with Half-Life 2, Crysis & Crysis 2. The game was totally ahead of it's time back when it came out in 2005! The graphics are SICK for a 6 year old game. The story is just fantastic and eerie. The gameplay & gun sounds and blood effects are some of the best I've seen in any FPS. Definatly one of the scariest games I've played as well. The mission packs are JUST as good too. Also some of my favorite weapons in a FPS. Nail gun ftw."
76561198001798760,1310990975,True,"Headshot a guy and it sends him flying streight up up a few feet.
Best physics ever."
76561198034364712,1310983600,True,lots of corridors
76561197968126968,1310943930,True,"The ending for this game was just about as great as a horror movie could get, then they had to ruin it by making more games."
76561197972353556,1310940615,True,"I know I'm six years late to the party, but this game is pretty damn good."
76561197966909710,1310854163,True,"One of my all time favourite games , play it on ""hard"" at night in the dark, and you have one hell of an experience , can't be beat for AI as of yet . And slo-mo ... what more do you need !"
76561198041161253,1310760718,True,Scary as hell.. But amazing at the same time xD
76561198042194629,1310687368,True,"fantastic game,scary in some parts. in the base game you don't get so scared but in extraction point... wow, some part you really get scared. the game have nice graphics, nice sounds, gore, and a fantastic history.
you begin to play and you can't stop, one of the best games that I had played. buy it o;"
76561198006221062,1310577883,True,"Scariest game I've ever played, also has a great story and some of the more challenging AI I've encountered. Play it in the dark with shadows on and the gamma set right...too many people don't and that just ruins the atmosphere of the game."
76561198006988408,1310466030,True,"""Yeah yeah it's too old to be scary.""

The expansions are mostly bull and the story in them too, and we won't even talk about the followups...

That aside, the original F.E.A.R. still makes you sweat and jump from scares. This game does subtle on a level that no other FPS to date has done. The ability to change pace from ""leaning around corners"" to ""running your pants off"" is also worth mentioning.

 A dead little girl that wants to skip rope with your spinal chord is still a little girl that wants to skip rope with your spinal chord, even in a game with outdated graphics."
76561197990038802,1310397176,True,Best game of the series by far.
76561198027252796,1310352105,True,this is a really great horror/FPS blend. if your a fan of either genre you should check this out
76561197968346354,1310330639,True,"One of the best First Person Shooters Horror based games I've ever played in my entire life. The tension, the storyline, gameplay, graphics, all make out for an unforgettable experience. Truly a very inspirational game and loads of fun."
76561197983627915,1310314438,True,https://youtu.be/ekLuKK7e9kQ
76561198024200799,1310281525,True,"Excellent game franchise, obviously you'll want to start with the first game in the series. Love the story, characters, gameplay, everything. Haha, I do have one warning if you buy this, it's a 17Gb download due to it including the Non-Canon expansion packs aswell."
76561198000422381,1310275935,False,"Lets call this 'baby's first horror game.'  Game is divided up into 'horror' and 'action' segments.  Meaning in the first you see creepy things and in the second you shoot clone soldiers.

AI reactivity is pretty good, even if all encounters have scripted beginnings (enemies wont spawn until you reach certain points, the game gives you rocket launchers before you fight robots, etc).  They throw grenades and quickly flank you.  There really isn't any stealth potential aside from catching enemies in the middle of their scripts.

Horror elements are only scary if you jump easily.  Game objects will fly across the room, random blood pools, lights flicker, or you have a weird hallucination, but nothing will attack you.  The only times you need to shoot in horror segments are against slowly moving phantasms, against ninjas (which only show up in two segments), and at the very end of the game where phantasms appear outside of hallucinations.

Not too difficult on 'hard', an OK game for cheap."
76561198009055009,1310080673,True,"When it comes down to shooting stuff, FEAR is one of the most satisfying experiences you could hope for. The enemies are challenging, so taking them down in slow motion is a thing of beauty. Let's take this scenario: you see a group of enemies on a lower level; you quickly throw a grenade towards the farthest ones, jump with your feet kicking in slow motion for the nearest enemy and after taking him down you quickly turn around towards the panicked remaining soldier, sending him away with a blast from the shotgun; during all this time the enemies shout and swear, trying to coordinate; dust, debris, sparks and glass shards are falling in slow motion from the bullets and explosions.

While the visuals are not that memorable, the sounds of the game will remain with you long after completing it. The story is passable; the horror aspect kept me in tension, even pulling some nice scares occasionally.

In conclusion, one of the best shooters ever made."
76561198038267496,1310078818,True,This game brings the fear in me!
76561197989259233,1310076459,True,Never face F.E.A.R. alone!
76561198009203494,1310064926,True,"Fun, chilling, 'and' cheap. A good deal in my book!"
76561198031104520,1310054631,True,Ok... gotta say it.. BEST GAME EVER.
76561198041420962,1310019062,True,"consiglio a tutti per chi non lo avesse provato di giocarlo perchè è uno dei migliori Fps di questi ultimi anni ed offre una storia seriosa dalle tinte horror.
L'unica attenzione che vi mostro alla vostra attenzione è che il gioco se lo comperate su steam è in inglese.
Detto questo però se siete persone che masticate abbastanza bene la lingua di Albione non potete lasciarvi sfuggire questa perla datata 2005 ;)

Il prezzo su steam dovrebbe aggirarsi intorno ai 5 € quindi davvero poco"
76561197991454757,1309999394,True,this one is as good as the new one.so if you like scary and alot of killing and blood this is the game for you
76561198033541772,1309994476,True,this is a very good game! the slo-mo mechanic is very well implimented
76561197972250875,1309978248,True,THIS IS GREAT
76561197986683805,1309954118,True,Oldish but still makes me jump!
76561197990062804,1309915980,True,Good game even if the graphics are starting to age a little. The Extraction Point expansion pack is by far one of the most scary games around.
76561197992612851,1309895012,True,"Far and away one of the best shooters Ive ever played; this insanely paced action/horror title is an absolute must. The combat is fast,frantic and incredibly visceral, with enemies that can be ragdolled, disscected, biscected or outright vaporized by your meaty arsenal, and environments can be drastically changed by the crossfire during a gunfight. The scares are all subtle and well earned, relying on atomsphere and tension rather than cheap jumps or loud noises to put the chills into you. The legendary combat A.I is almost as frightening, enemies will sweep and clear rooms and patrol or guard areas when unalerted to your presence, and manuver tactically when engaged with you, flanking, moving soldiers in tactically and using grenades to flush you out of cover. The result is a game thats as much about thinking on your feet and decisive tactical decision making as it is about shooting, and its a unique experinece that hasnt really been replicated since.

This game is amazing, its well worth your time, and money."
76561198004653660,1309891506,True,ca fait peur et tout

76561198011701447,1309876576,True,"If you don't get it for the scary, get it for the silly. I mean, seriously now. Physics on this thing are so stupid that even G-Mod looks at this thing and goes ""Waitwhat.""
SniPING AS usual, I see."
76561198014525726,1309848466,True,Awsome Game Great Storytelling Buy the Exp packs awsell
76561197983897547,1309830635,True,A great game. A good horror-FPS with legimitate scares.
76561197992187370,1309823516,True,"I wrote my original review 6 years ago, but this game is still amazing in 2017. Everyone likes to circlejerk the AI and how amazing it is, and personally, I think it is valid. The AI holds up and all of the weapons are fun to use, especially the pistol and the Penetrator. 

The story is alright, it has plenty of points that help move it along and theres more depth to it than just *soldier guy has to go take out the bad guys.* 

I have a soft spot for this game because it brings me back to Goldeneye/Perfect Dark days. I love the office environments especially, and the atmosphere for this game is haunting and beautiful at the same time."
76561197968840612,1309797100,False,"Our borderline memorable tactical shooter is too borderline memorable. I know, let's put in that girl from The Ring in it."
76561198004776836,1309791486,True,"This is a great shooter.  There are slightly creepy parts and a great story.  It is very linear, but it doesn't hold the game back."
76561197973438681,1309779085,True,"FEAR, played thru the game, wow.... it is a very well written game that really draws you into the story and action. You never really know what is going to happen next.... AI was some of the best that I have seen in an FPS, hide, when they re-load, duck into cover... Very nice flanking. I really enjoyed this game.. MP is a free add on that you can get from the site. Check it out if you are not afraid  :)   Bad joke..  know, good game... Trust me"
76561198022788279,1309778786,True,Scariest F.E.A.R game of the lot.
76561198002681227,1309765777,True,Really fun game with a great a atmosphere. Might be scary to some to other not that scary but it doesn't take away from the experience.
76561198022871289,1309758737,True,"Quite possibly my favourite shooter :D
Play this and ignore the 2 sequals

OMG ITS A SCARY PHYSIC EVIL DEMON GIRL!!! 
GRHAGRHAR"
76561197998880670,1309750729,True,This is the best of the FEAR campaigns.

76561198013190345,1309744728,True,"An oldie but a goodie... Played it again recently. Good gameplay, some genuine moments of shock and suspense. Just a fun all round FPS... (Doing this for the achievement)"
76561198003145207,1309744498,True,"Great story, incredible music, awesome gameplay, and scary as shit. Not a game I could play home alone."
76561198007430354,1309736691,True,"One of the best single player FPS games I've played. The slomo mechianic is fun and the AI is excellent, leading to a great combat experience. I'm not much of a horror fan in general, but I enjoyed the atmosphere the game created."
76561197993544970,1309734096,True,"Despite it's old age this is still one of the best shooters ever made. It's definite worth a buy, but it desperately needs a patch. You can fix the lag by downloading a .dll file which is put into the game folder. Other than that it's gucci."
76561197993210685,1309732680,True,The whole FEAR series is just beautiful :3
76561197985626283,1309732113,True,Nice FPS it has some good guns i feel like its missing a little something but when the little girl first popped up she scared the hell out of me(i emptied a clip on it)

76561198015089284,1309725694,True,"This game is surprisingly still good even after 5 years and  the graphics aren't half bad. The story is a little confusing to understand unless you do a lot of exploration around the levels and the AI is notoriously difficult unless you slow down time, but overall the game is fun with a few good scares thrown in. 8/10.....PS if you're borderline on the DLC, it's not worth it because the storyline is an unofificial add-on and they only add in a few more guns and enemies"
76561198029150354,1309723382,True,"Amazing FPS, and comes with both expansions.  One of them's crap."
76561197972448343,1309722157,True,When I first bought this on a cheap sale on steam. I was not expecting such a great game to come out of it. Fear is an incredible game which will actually scare you sometimes. It has a very good storyline and a easy to use simple HUDD. I think this game was a mix between doom and half life. If you see on sale or have some extra cash. Make sure that you try it.
76561197980527798,1309722122,True,An awesome FPS with some scary moments. I had a lot of fun with this one :)
76561198016747099,1309721272,True,Scarry!!

76561197967801082,1309504367,True,"A strange game. It mixes horror and FPS action in an odd way. While the horror segments are dark/dimly lit, quiet, and have jump/atmospheric scares, the action sections are well-lit, have action/military music, and get the blood pumping. Generally, the game goes in a horror-action-horror-action-action pattern. It doesn't necessarily feel jarring, but in a way it is comforting to see other lifeforms around, even if you will be shooting them.

Speaking of others, the AI certainly has received lots of attention. They lean, toss nades when youre hiding, run away while shooting, blindfire, and move towards you in two's. I played the game on Hard, but they do have good accuracy and the later enemies have a good way of making you grind through Medkits.

This game isn't scary in a Silent Hill sense, but the story is good and the ""hallucinations"" are both creepy/strange enough and give hints onto why everything is happening. Overall, a good FPS, I suggest you try it!"

The expansion packs included in here are ""expansion"" packs, not ""upgrade"" packs so don't expect anything to be better, just more of the game.
Extraction Point picks up from the events of the original game.
Perseus Mandate is in the same timeline but in a different section of the area and you are the Sergeant who apparently has SloMo effects as well. From my experience I've been traumatized of turning around whenever I follow something into a dead end in this part of the expansion pack.

Overall this is actually a great FPS if not the scariest game I've played cause I don't play that many horror-themed games."

76561198009739783,1309001970,True,"F.E.A.R. is a horror-themed FPS.
This is a game that FPS gamers will love.
Although the gameplay is simple and linear, the story line is amazing. Like going through a movie.

F.E.A.R. was voted among the most scary games every made by many reviewers. And tbh they were not wrong. The game uses very nice scenes with slowmotion and envirornment changes to scare you or to make you focus, and not the kind of jump tactitcs other games use. It is developed in a very smart way to not let you get bored.

For a 2005 game, it is spectacular graphics. Allthough the  geometry of the graphics is simple, the game has super awesome effects, shadows, particles, textures. 
The gameplay aslo features slowmotion mode, splatter, and a nice but not too big variety of weapons.
Also it is hard.. trying to play the game harder than the normal mode will require lots of skill.

This is one fine game, recommended!"
76561197977496938,1308951123,True,"Of all the first person shooter games that I've played in the past and present, this is probably one of the best for a number of reasons. The game is visually stunning both during combat and out. The audio is so well used that it will give you chills when something frightening occurs in the game. The gameplay itself is explosive, so much that you almost always be surprised by the enemy hiding around the corner waiting for you.

The game transitions well from scene to scene. You could be walking through a dark corridor, haunted by demons and ghosts, and as soon as you turn the next corner, there is a squad of enemy soldiers waiting to open fire on you. The story itself is excellent as it takes you through the game and reveals the history behind what occured before you arrived there.

This is a solid first person shooter, through and through. It's well worth the money."
76561198002148461,1308855775,True,"The Penetrator is the most visceral gun I've ever seen in a manshooter (even more in slow-mo). On that topic, FEAR is a great SP manshooter and it plays just right. There's only just enough interaction, and it doesn't interfere with the action. The UI doesn't get in the way, melee is fun, slow-mo is fun, and it's unabashedly gory. It's questionably horror-like though, and the game never finds a good way to combine manshooter with horror. The game makes really, really good use of shadows though, so that makes up for some of the lost creepiness. (play with gamma turned down lower than your usual!)

The expansions are so-so; they come up with some new, welcome features and guns but it's largely the same. Except the maps in Perseus Mandate aren't very good, and whoever did the lighting is not very good at his job."
76561198027203433,1308837812,True,"Nicely scary (make sure you're playing alone around midnight), though the gameplay is repetitive and almost uninteresting, apart from the ninja kicks and slow-mo."

76561198002864804,1308757973,True,"High quality AI and the ability to slow down time forge memorable moments that keep F.E.A.R. exciting and fun despite its other run-of-the-mill FPS characteristics and lackluster story. The enemies will come in droves, will communicate, flank, flush you out with grenades, and are deadly accurate with their weapons. Your character is a super-soldier, whose faster than superman reflexes are represented by your ability to slow down time. This makes it possible to survive against your foes, and it also makes it thrilling.

Imagine slowing down time after throwing a grenade, blowing it up by shooting it midair taking out two hostiles in the explosion, then leaping over a nearby ledge whilst bicycle-kicking another enemy in the face taking him out. Your remaining enemies, who are all but decimated, say things like ""we can't stop him!"" , and ""he just killed our whole squad!"", and you just can't help but smile , knowing full well you're the ultimate bad-ass."

Monolith Timegate really did a great job in putting together a quality game that will give you chills. It reminds me of those horror movies like The Ring and The Grudge. It provides the right complement of shooting action combined with well placed cut scenes. Many of the enemies are quite unique and offer some serious challenge on the higher difficulty settings. The slow motion feature does make the game a little easy, but you can deliberately not use it. The ideal way to experience this game is to create a scare factor atmosphere by playing it at night with the lights turned off. Highly recommended if you've never played it."

The flanking AI was revolutionary when this game first came out and still challenging today."
76561197979132618,1305366922,False,"I got to say, I'm a little disappointed in F.E.A.R. I was expecting more horror from the get go, and then when they mention the protagonist has psychic powers, I was thinking it was going to be an updated Second Sight. But, alas, all you get is bullet time, which you will abuse the crap out of. Every level is just dull, maze-like complexes with a constant skirmishes between yourself and an unending army of bland, generic clones. Every now and then there's a very predictable and reused jump scare. Occasionally, you'll get a  creepy thing getting dragged around a corner, but often you miss these because you weren't looking in the right direction, so you just get a musical cue.

On the whole, I was hoping for The Ring, but with guns. In then end I was miserably disappointed by:

Being able to shoot ghosts. Seriously, it takes all the horror out of the game if you can just shoot everything. There's no feeling of helplessness or panic, just another wave of enemies."
76561198010978487,1305092113,True,"There is one word with four letters to describe this game -- F.E.A.R. F.E.A.R. a.k.a First Encounter Assault Recon is a 2005 game that was first reliesed on the Xbox 360. This game manipulises the mind by mixing psi-horor, scary pop-ups and random ghost-like enemys to startle and/or piss the players pants, I have beaten this game twice so far, and each time it is still scary because of some of the parts that don't appear in your first playthrough, if this were my review I would rate it an 8 out of 10, for its freaky tone and ominous atmosphere."
76561198001077704,1304250973,True,"FEAR isn't scary. If you were worried about playing it because you get scared easily, then stop worrying, because it's not scary. The game has a bit of a horror-vibe, sure, but at most, this manifests in occasional minor shock scares, and weird hallucinations of a little girl. If you're looking for a horror experience, look elsewhere, because you won't find it here.

However, if you're looking for one of the best first person shooter games ever created, then you've come to the right place.

FEAR is a John Woo film in videogame form, and was the best example of it before stranglehold came out. For what it lacks in any meaningful horror, it makes up for bombastic action and gun-play that would make any fan of shooting things with guns quiver with delight, but let's start at the beginning.

You play the role of Pointman, a soldier part of an elite group, tasked with killing a person named Paxton Fettel, who is a psychic that controls an army of clone soldiers, and has gone on a sort of rampage, killing everyone inside of the ATC headquarters, the main area the game takes place in. You also start seeing visions of different strange locations, and keep seeing a little girl in a red dress, seemingly following and taunting you. I'm not going to delve any deeper into things regarding the story, because it's actually fairly decent, and should be experienced without spoilers. There are very minimal cutscenes in the game, and the majority of the story is told during gameplay, where you're free to move around and do stuff while it's happening. Much of the pieces of the mystery are put together through listening to optional phone messages, so honestly, you could mostly skip the story if you wanted, and though it's a decent story, you wouldn't be missing out on that much, because the real meat of this game is in the gameplay.

Pacing of the game is fairly normal. You move from area to area, making your way past groups of enemy forced, and progress the story. There's nothing too special here, but the environments are nice, if mostly fairly samey, seeing as the entire game takes place in a single (extremely large) building basically. Even still, there is some variety to locations, with indoor and outdoor places, some rooftops and some carparks, and other such stuff. It's all good, and fits the setting.

FEAR's combat reigns supreme against most FPS titles. You have a wide variety of weapons, ranging from submachineguns, assault rifles, shotguns, pistols (which you can dual wield), particle cannons, nailguns, rocket launchers, grenades, trip mines, and other such things. Each of the weapons packs an appropriate, and very strong level of PUNCH to them, and the act of shooting enemies is an absolute joy. Enemies will rag-doll and jiggle with each hit they take, and can be decapitated, bisection, charred to the bone, stuck to walls, and blown into a fine red mist. The weapons are almost perfectly balanced against each other. If you wanted to, disregarding ammo limitations, you could go through the whole game with dual pistols, and still be as effective as using any other weapon, because they still take down enemies in just a few well placed shots, have good accuracy and penetration, a high clip size, and fast firing speed. Every weapon is a knockout, and no matter what you choose, you're basically never going to be at a disadvantage, unless you do something insanely stupid like pick up 3 close range explosive weapons with small amounts of ammo or something like that. Ammunition is plentiful for the slightly more normal and basic weaponry, like the shotgun and assault rifle, and a bit more limited for the more crazy/powerful stuff, but there's still more than enough to be able to use everything and have fun doing it. You can only use 3 guns at once, but different weapon types are commonly encountered, and 3 slots is enough to be able to cover all grounds, be effective in all situations, and still have space to equip shit just for fun.

Of course, there are 2 other parts of combat that make FEAR really stand out that I have yet to mention. First off, your body is also a weapon. FEAR has a relatively decent melee system for a game of this sort. You can melee enemies with the butt of your gun, you can slide into enemies, and you can fly-kick them down flights of stairs. Melee attacks are extremely powerful, and will one-shot the majority of enemies in the game. In addition to all this, your character also has something called ""reflex time"", which is just slow motion that you can activate whenever you want for a limited amount of time, which refills slowly by itself. This mechanic is just unbelievably fun, and you'll be using it for the entire game. FEAR is at it's best when you walk into a room, get spotted by a group of enemies, turn on slow motion, hear an enemy yell out ""HHHOOOOSSSSTTTIIILLLEEE!"" before you roundhouse kick him in the face, and then blow his friend in half with your shotgun, and then go back to normal speed gameplay before the dust has settled.

Fun weapons wouldn't mean nearly as much without fun enemies to fight, and by god, does fear do this well. When it was released, FEAR's AI was revolutionary. Enemies are smart, move from cover to cover, jump through windows, communicate with each other, flank, toss grenade, spot flashlight light, and other such things. They also have personalities, and you can really hear the fear in their voices when you've wiped out their whole team, and they're the only ones left. Nowerdays, FEAR's AI isn't all that special, but it's still absolutely fine in every way, and works without issue. There are a few different types of enemies in the game, including giant mechs, ninjas (basically), flying robots, armored units, and police, but for the VAST majority of the time, you're going to be fighting replica soldiers. Some people might think that's boring, but, to take a words of a late reviewer that I love, ""That's like complaining that there's only one type of vagina"". The replica soldiers are extremely fun to fight, and you could reload a save before a fight over and over again, and have completely different results every single time. Enemy death sounds will be ingrained in your head after playing this, because they are just that good and memorable.

Visuals of the game were great for their time, and even now still look good. Music is also great, comprised of creepy tunes for when you're wondering around dark hallways alone, and frantic battle music whenever you're in a fight. There's nothing I can complain about regarding this.

FEAR is decently long, at about 8 or 9 hours for the main game, but you also get 2 expansions with the Steam version, which are fun and provide even more gameplay. It's very sad that FEAR 2 and FEAR 3 went in completely different direction to the first game, and ended up being much weaker products as a result, but FEAR is still around, and has not aged at all in terms of how much fun it is.

This is usually the part where I talk about the negatives of the game, but FEAR doesn't really have much to talk about here. Sure, the horror is trash, but that doesn't matter, because you're playing this for the action, which is 10/10 and constant. There are moments of downtime for story related elements to take place, but they aren't annoying frequent, and usually don't take control away from you. There are some minor exploratory elements which can slow the game down a little, but give big rewards. Ammo for some of the weapons can be just a little lacking, but if you're smart about things, you'll always have more than enough.

FEAR is a damn near perfect game in my opinion. I've played through it several times, and I'm sure I'll play through it several more times in the future. If you want to feel like an absolute bad-ass, this is the game for you.

F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon combines energetic and thrilling combat, spiced up with a slow-mo ability and an intricate AI, with an exciting horror story creating a solid atmosphere (the ambiance is godly, as well as the sound design). The story features an angry little girl with long black hair who is on par with her Japanese spiritual predecessor Samara.

Some of its graphics might not have been the best at the time of release, but indeed the lighting system and physics made (and still make) the game attractive. The style of environment design is rather minimalist, and it might seem a bit repetitive, but the setting changes with new levels contrasting abandoned warehouses and slums with the sharp and tidy look of the evil corporation’s hallways. Plus, the game often offers seemingly alternate ways through the buildings, along with hidden stashes of ammo, health, upgrades, or audio logs, rewarding thorough exploration of its otherwise linear level design.

F.E.A.R. is one hell of a ride that excels in combining its elements into one masterpiece that’s a blast to play. Even after whopping sixteen years since the release, the captivating audiovisual presentation and thrilling gameplay still work. Along with the horror that lurks everywhere in the game, it will entertain the hell out of you to the point of awesome-sauce tears of a die-hard first-person shooter and horror nerd.

[b][u] 9/10 [/u][/b]

+ unforgettable horror atmosphere, thrilling action gameplay, top-notch unique soundtrack, great lighting and physics, captivating story
- the linear level design may seem repetitive nearing the end, relatively easy even on Extreme difficulty with MMod (highly recommended), but I replayed it at least six times

I’d kill for the addition of Steam achievements to this game. The console versions seem temptingly challenging.

76561197998141842,1299355455,True,fucking terrifying fuck
76561197995204295,1298440272,True,"As a FPS fan, I like this game. Especially with the slow-mo gameplay to it, especially the Replica's radio chatter which are amusing to listen to. xD So snag it if you like things that shock you or a horror-theme fan."
76561198019861430,1298273780,True,"""It's only a game...it's only a game."" I repeated as if the mantra was going to save me from Alma. I am being a bit melo-dramatic but this game is scarier than some horror movies I've watched. F.E.A.R is a psycological mind freak where you play as a point man on the lookout for Paxton Fettle, who has escaped from his prison and now controls over one thousand super soldier with his mind, and they are all gunning for you. If that is not enough you begin to have weird vision and hear strange noises that creep up on you, so you never know what is going to happen. I played this game and had nightmares afterwards of firefights and Alma out to get me. The game is a brilliant mix of tension, action, horror and the AI is top notch. Do yourself a favor and grab this title, and play it...with the lights off...if you dare; after all, it's only a game... or is it?"
76561197996163139,1298182671,False,"Generic FPS action with the occasional really cool surreal ""horror"" scene. You've got to grind through way too many generic firefights among bland backdrops to get to the good stuff."
76561197964009814,1298140181,True,"An interesting horror FPS, but no surival aspect to it.  Its a decent ""slow mo"" affects FPS killing para-military through city enviroments.  In between battles you are confronted by ghostly mental attacks, but they are rarely even able to kill you; but more for story.  The real game is just shooting people.  Good if you like single player FPS with a few good scares."
76561198026038272,1297995825,True,Great FPS with some spooky shit thrown in!
76561198013499586,1297906726,True,"Ignore what you may think this game is, its not survival horror, its a Rambo simulator, complete with the SloMo ""Win"" button. If there is any fear present, its when the bad guys shit themselves as you flykick a door open and surgically headshot everyone in the room with a pair of pistols in slow motion before your feet really touch the ground."
76561197984611071,1297562600,True,"I'm not gonna write a full blown review of the game, but suffice to say it's a nice scary horror FPS with creepy atmosphere and ""boo!"" scares."
76561197991919198,1297532611,True,"Love this game & recommend it to any1 that liked:

!. the slow motion effect in max payne.
2.like the feelof swat 4.
3.liked the dark atmosphere game play of doom 3.
4.appreciate great older games that still look good.
5.as of feb 2011 there are about 200+ MP servers running if SP wasn't enough."
76561198032934679,1297499282,True,"A classic FPS horror game that perfectly juggles between high-octane gunfights and creepy supernatural ghost shit perfectly. For a game released in 2005, the atmosphere and gunplay still somewhat hold up well today. And of course, no review could go without mentioning the incredible enemy AI. How a 15-year-old shooter can have fair and challenging enemies without giving them aimbot accuracy or massive amounts of health is an incredible feat. Try to play like Call of Duty and you'll be gunned down fast because the game will force you to respect the opposition.

Enough of the action, what about the horror? If you're familiar with any kind of Japanese horror, you'll feel right at home since the main antagonist, Alma, looks straight up out of something from the Grudge and has many ways of messing with the player. You might be a super soldier that can tear through dozens of armored soldiers, but what good can bullets do against a little ghost girl that can make people explode with her mind?"
76561198028574882,1297483513,True,Scariest game I've played with challenging gameplay.
76561197966898422,1296948764,True,"scary with a detailed storyline, this come close to Half life 2 as one of the best FPS i have ever played."
76561197986511953,1296809154,True,"The origins of FEAR are myred in old action films by John Woo. Mixed with a few sporatic horror bits thrown in. FEAR to it's core is an action game that molds itself to the player's own skills. All the weapons are balanced, even the dual pistols compared to the rail gun. The game forces you into massive firefights using only your super human slow motion powers and guns to defend yourself.

Truly, if you like action movies you will perfectly enjoy FEAR. It's AI is complex and dynamic, and is truly a thrill ride from start till finish."
76561197983846902,1296550521,True,"With excellent AI and seriously freaky scares, FEAR reaches the upper echelon of PC FPS titles."
76561197989019127,1296533482,True,A nearly perfect balance between atmospheric horror and intense (and often hilarious) action. HIghly recommended.
76561198010591865,1296302902,True,this one
76561197979378676,1296005743,True,FLASHLIGHT!
76561197972404064,1295973003,True,"The F.E.A.R series has been that game, that has come out in the middle. It isn't the most popular, topping Call of Duty or Halo, but it's not the least popular either. It has a loyal fan base, and you know, nothing is wrong with that. It brings amazing slow motion action scenes. Incredible environments that can be destroyed, and, to some, this is one of the scariest game series. With so much going for it, in terms of games and expansion packs, this is a series you should own, for the price is right, and the action and scares are waiting. Pick it up, there is nothing to fear but F.E.A.R it self."
76561197995205281,1295818233,True,"Definitely a must-have! Cool storyline, excellent gameplay mechanics/physics, sick weapons (although the variety could have been a little better, but they certainly did a good job covering all the bases, in terms of weapon class!), really intense/scary moments that'll make you jump and spray-and-pray! lol. >.<
I'd give it about an 8.8/10"
76561197982853347,1295666679,True," I LOL'd at the fact that, after all the heavily-armed super soliders, Mechs, etc, that the scariest thing in this game is a little girl.

Good atmosphere, and very much worth playing."
76561197968001440,1295081724,True,"The story is interesting enough and the action keeps up pretty well. As far as being scary? A few dark areas and WTF moments but you're not going to have a heart attack. I think I beat this game no problem because of the slow down time mechanism making it easy, but it also made for some fun moments too."
76561197989807190,1295019727,True,"Monolith Productions has remained one of the most important studios for me for the longest time. I liked Blood as a teen, but my own proper PC wasn’t a thing until 2001, which was just about the time The Operative: No One Lives Forever got released. That classic, which is still sadly not re-released due to rights issues, was just the beginning. Fantastic Aliens versus Predator 2 followed with its 3 story campaigns that constantly cross over – something that is still a rarity for games. Then, of course, a long expected sequel No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.’s Way. Then one of the best movie license games ever – Tron 2.0. And then, in a single year, two amazing games got released – F.E.A.R. and Condemned: Criminal Origins. I am not listing a couple of other games they developed, just due to not playing them myself (though I did play Contract J.A.C.K., which isn’t worth mentioning), but point is – Monolith never disappointed me.

F.E.A.R. was the point where everything started changing. With the game itself, as it was a unique blend of ideas from classic FPS titles and the more “modern” ideas for the genre. For the company, since after this year their projects started getting less praise. And even for the company focus – a switch from their PC-centric development (LithTech engine was specifically designed to be a showcase of DirectX), to a far larger emphasis on consoles. 8 years after F.E.A.R. was originally released, a lot of its faults are more obvious. Yet, it still never fails to amaze.

I suppose, this game could be described as a military shooter, but with elements of horror and without all those terrible tropes that make you roll your eyes when you hear “military shooter”. You do play as a serious soldier dude in a serious special forces team which are super serious, gritty and realistic, except they deal with supernatural threats. You kick doors open, lean around corners, listen to enemy squad communications, follow a very linear story along pretty linear levels, which are full of somewhat more open for exploration arenas. Melee kills enemies in one hit, you can carry only 3 weapons on you, get on-screen hints and there’s even a health regeneration system (though only the critical minimum gets restored). Sometimes you also depend on NPCs to progress, or on the fact if all enemies in the area are dead or not. This is pretty generic for a modern shooter, yet F.E.A.R. manages to still retain a lot of older FPS concepts that make the game far more exciting than what we tend to have nowadays.

For example, despite the linearity of everything, you barely ever need to watch the full scene or wait for an NPC to open the door for you. If you can avoid the enemies, do it, no one’s stopping you. If you know where to go and don’t need other NPCs to tell you, go ahead. So even though there are occasional scenes you must go through, or wait for an enemy to open the door (or more likely break the wall), the player sets the pace of the game most of the time. And the action is a perfect blend of fun and challenge. To this day, the AI in this game feels extremely smart. Enemies communicate, know when to gang up on you, know when to wait in ambush or when to get to you from behind. Of course, this occasionally leads to Benny Hill style chases around a shipping container or something as silly, but these blunders can be easily forgiven. I still adore how stupid and outsmarted it makes me feel if I forget to turn off the lights when casually exploring a new location only to hear a “Flashlight!” from somewhere in front of me. It’s in these details the game shines the most.

And there’s a lot of shining in the game. Monolith aimed at reproducing the feel of John Woo movies (and The Matrix, of course). And approached this in the same simple yet smart way as Duke Nukem 3D and Half-Life did years before – by inserting a lot of tiny interactions into the world. Things that are insignificant on their own, but in motion make this game feel amazing. Levels in F.E.A.R. look bland, boring and minimalist, yet when a shootout starts, when you see all the sparks, blood, dust, all the paper flying around, the glass breaking, the explosions and shock waves they produce, it’s just… beautiful. You can capture a screenshot of an enemy meeting your shotgun blast behind a glass wall that’s slowly turning into a scattered puzzle and it can look kinda nice. But in motion, especially with you in control of this horribly astonishing ballet of violence and blood, it feels like nothing else. Especially since the slow-mo the game has works well, both visually and gameplay-wise. Because, apart from it looking amazing, it also allowed for the game action pace remaining as quick as what you’d expect in an older FPS, with no need to slow things down – players can do that when they feel like it. And when you don’t feel like it, levels fly by just as if the game was from the 90s. This pace and excitement is something that has been missing in FPS of this generation.

Two expansions, Extraction Point & Perseus Mandate, were developed by the team at TimeGate Studios, which is now unfortunately shut down after going through the horrible situation with Aliens: Colonial Marines. This team tried their best. They tried to make levels more varied, add more enemy types, more weapons, tell a more gripping storyline (at this they failed astonishingly bad), create visually memorable scenes (like the one in the header from Extraction Point) and be scarier than the original. While they have achieved some of these goals, the expansions actually feel much less fun to play. First expansion, for example, just feels boring due to lots of action in rather uninteresting locations. While the second aims to be something akin to Half-Life: Opposing Force, yet instead feels like a bad retelling of the main game and cannot keep its horror and action bits balanced. Also, it looks very ugly with its attempts to make more “open air” levels, despite the engine not handling it well, and later by going for a very Quake-ish look that doesn’t fit the game at all. Both of the expansions add those dreadful “wait for the NPC to do their thing” moments that the main game tried to avoid. Oh and there’s a final boss in the second expansion that is just plain bad.

Luckily, the expansions are currently sold as part of the package with the main game and there’s no need to pay extra to check them out, in case you’re still curious. The main game itself, though, is fantastic. It hasn’t been a visual benchmark for years now and it does have some things that are simply outdated. And maybe this playthrough I’ve done will be the last and I won’t replay this game again. But just in case no other game recreates the beauty of these shootouts in slow-mo, I will know where to find Paxton Fettel and his wooden plank to the face.

P.S. I kinda wish the game had a bonus mode with cheats on, though you can use actual cheat commands via the “say” prompt. It’s incredibly fun to run around with infinite ammo for the gun that melts all enemies into skeletons.

P.P.S. Oh and the game intro is still one of my absolute favorites. Also, despite its minimalist ambience, the soundtrack is super awesome as well."
76561198000593517,1295015371,True,"Nice FPS with great atmosphere and interesting combat thanks to the slowmotion feature. Both expansion packs are included as well, so it's a great deal."
76561197980754335,1294963436,True,"A good game marred by repetitive enemy and level design.

The main combat in FEAR is above average in many ways, but it relies on what would normally be a gimmick in most other titles - slo-mo.  Strangely enough, it does this better than almost any before and after it, including Dead 2 Rights, Max Payne, and even the Matrix games which should have been the progeneting standards (though the movie itself is still the primary influence, and its best feature is recreated spectacularly in FEAR.)  This all works in synergy with the very capable enemy AI, creating a challenging and believable arena in which to display your skills.  It's a shame there isn't more baddie variety; the tougher opponents become reycled come endgame and the majority of your shootouts are against helmeted clone armies dressed in SWAT-camo attire.

It holds up well due to proficient visuals (sans poor environments,) tight controls, and light horror elements which should give you a couple shocks throughout.  8/10."
76561197997425403,1294886495,True,"One of the scariest games you'll play.
Has a pretty good solid story.
Best of the FEAR series."
76561198014572979,1294877432,True,"If you're looking for a scary game - this is medium I would say.

If you're looking for a great FPS with many gun battles along with some puzzle solving elements and a reasonably lengthed story, then this is great.


Its scary in parts, but eventually you realise the real threat can be defeated with some bullets and possibly explosives."
76561197994963828,1294876948,True,"One of the best adrenaline filled horror games out  there. The action packed combat keeps you on your toes and alert, which makes the horror sequences all the more scary. It certainly made me jump out of my seat quite a few times, in fact I think I had to change pants once... The first installment of the FEAR series is, in my opinion, the best. The expansions are only good for the gameplay, there is absolutely no substance storywise. This game is not for the faint of heart. For those of you that think you can stand the heat, buy it, play it, and sleep with the lights on."
76561197977778650,1294385074,True,"This is the original. This game is awesome for its AI, story, and atmosphere.
A solid A+ shooter with a story that will keep you guessing.

Better than the sequel and still a fun and beautiful game."
76561197984407947,1294177641,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of the greatest single player experiences in gaming history.  The game sports some of the best combat and action sequences ever to be played, all while creating an incredibly frightening atmosphere revolving around a thrilling storyline (probably the best since Half-Life).  It is noted as maintaining the delicate balance between action, horror and storytelling, a feat that few titles manage to achieve today.  F.E.A.R. never pulls the same gag twice.  The developers literally thought of every possible way to creep you out and they are batting 100%.  Immerse yourself in F.E.A.R. and you'll be treated to an action packed terror ride, spanning some of the best 8-10 hours you'll spend in front of your computer."
76561197974975745,1294018696,True,"typical fps, excellent single player campaign...for maximum effect play in the dark with headphones!"
76561197975447805,1293953479,True,I own a retail copy of this which I beat but during the 2010 holiday sale it was so cheap on Steam I went ahead and purchased it on here as well. Too bad Fear  2 dropped the ball. Fear 1 was total badassery.
76561197976010832,1293832072,True,"Ever wanted to star in your own John Woo movie? F.E.A.R sets the bar unbelievably high when it comes to enemy intelligence and cinematic action. When you aren't gunning down squads of heavily-armed super soldiers using your super-human reflexes, you'll be peeking around every corner in anticipation of the next scare. Even though the protagonist is armed, F.E.A.R manages to make the player feel vulnerable to the paranormal activity that shadows the already tense gameplay. Bullet-Time, Kung Fu, Ninjas and Robots all star in this action blockbuster and create an experience I personally haven't felt since Half-Life 1."
76561197993965832,1293806752,True,"Doom 3 freaked me out for the first half n hour until I realised it got a bit boring. F.E.A.R. however managed to keep up my levels of anxiety throughout the majority of the game.
Yes it became somewhat formulaic; shooty bit, scary bit, shooty bit, lights flicker, scary bit. But the combat was actually top notch and pretty visceral, I loved having to wait until the dust settled after a firefight, and there were some genuinely spasm inducing moments in it.

If you haven't played it, get it cheap and have a go just for the experience."
76561198002765789,1293757520,True,"Just... just buy it. There's no logical reason not to. Seriously, give me a good reason as to why you wouldn't get it! Fantastic ai, good difficulty, and great enviroments as well as good voice acting. Just buy it. NOW."
76561197980910801,1293743985,True,"F.E.A.R. was, and always will be, one of the most under rated shooters of all time. Even though it plays like a standard corridor shooter, everything is done to perfection. The guns are all unique and feel great -- a nailgun that can pin people to walls like ragdolls? A particle beam cannon that leaves nothing but the skeletal remains of a foe in a pool of blood? Hell yes. Also of note is the enemy A.I.: it's still some of the best I've seen in any shooter to date. Lastly, and most obviously, F.E.A.R. is pretty spooky. Sometimes it's cheap, Doom 3, Jack-in-the-box scary, but sometimes it's very effective scripted psychological horror. One second, you're in the a hallway that looks just like the last five you've been through, and the next second you're in a burning hospital coated in blood with a little girl yelling at you. It's just scary enough to put you on edge, but not scary enough to make you feel like going to bed with a cross and a stake."
76561197970313625,1293566248,True,Pretty good horror FPS.  Not very scary.  Awesome AI.
76561197986279961,1293525368,True,"I recommend this game because the majority of it is fun. But once you reach the vault level, do yourself a favor. Quit and say you have completed the game. You are basically done, all thats left is a really shitty walk through annoying floating naked people in slow motion through a bland environment. Your guns get taken away from you twice but all weapons are pretty much useless becuase the floating naked people are best killed by your shit pistol. There are plenty of things that annoy me about this game, like the invisible fast twats who punch half your health away or the floating dreamcatchers that lazily kill you to death. The game is not even that scary. The horror is really phoned in. Pop scares which startle more than actually scare make the game unbearable. A 'scary' person standing while the nearby orchestra tries to kill you with 'scary' music makes the game annoying. The only reason I like this game is because the AI is advanced making fighting soldiers incredibly enjoayable."
76561197973200565,1293511478,True,"FEAR 2005. one of the good games to come out of the the mid 2000's. Just after HL2 and just before Doom 3 this game shines in its glory. I found the story to be not too long and not too diluted, as for the scare bits, they are scripted. which isnt that scary cuz most the time you know its coming, cuz the tension builds upt to it. It is on par with Doom 3 in most Every aspect, with better support up to patch 1.08. The expansions are a different story. I was un able to play them upon writing this because of the bugs and I found that with the Axetivision Fiasco and Fear 2/ ORIGIN BS They officially do not have any type of support or patches to fix common issues. :( 

7/10 -F.E.A.R.
~/10 Extraction point and Perseus mandate"
76561197985849307,1293476950,True,Still looks great after all these years. And scary too...
76561198006262436,1293423065,True,"My favorite game. I swear it was made for just me. My personal fighting tactic solved every combat situation, i quick-saved within 2 seconds of a checkpoint save, and it was my kind of survival horror. Not startle eek, but actual horror. VERY well written."
76561197996033380,1293422532,True,"F.E.A.R. is one of the FPS's with the best AI I've ever seen.They'll try to do ambushes,move around and use the enviroment to their advantage.The pack contains both vanilla and the expansions (Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate).

Also,a word of caution for Logitech keyboard/Mice owners.The game has trouble polling the devices on Windows 7,causing massive framerate drops.Check the forums for a fix."
76561197999978699,1293346539,True,"One of my favorite Horror FPS highly recommend it to everyone. Steam FEAR includes all the DLC for the original as well so your getting 3 games for the price of one. Great story, good scares, and plays very smooth with a good emphasis on using the bullet time abilities of the main character definately a must for fans or players of FEAR 2. Also FEAR 3 is coming soon an will feature both the main character and villans from this game."
76561197991873054,1293266160,True,Probably has the best suspense moments than any other game out there. Get it chicken. Are you chicken? Chicken chicken chicken chicken!

76561198011734598,1292991695,True,I LOVE THIS GAME
76561198021877026,1292969564,True,"[h1]Chris Hansen with guns[/h1]Not gonna lie, it was hard to wrap my head around exactly what this game was about. So we drop in as a special forces unit trying to find some kind of cannibal dude with psychic powers. Pretty odd, but it doesn't stop there. There's a little girl in a red dress you frequently run into who has long greasy hair running down her face. That's when it hit me. This is clearly a Chris Hansen simulator!

At this moment I realized it was my duty in the game to save this poor girl from potential predators. Unfortunately, every time you get close to her, she vanishes before your eyes! Dammit! Or at least that's what I thought until I reflected on it. The fact that this small ghost girl constantly appears and disappears when you approach her, my player character's pursuit of her, the haunting music and so many other things caused me to realize something else. It's trying to teach you how bad it is to chase small ghost girls around. You might terrify them and look like a stalker yourself! Wow! I never have had much experience dealing with kids given that I'm typing this review up from inside my nourishment tube that keeps me alive for centuries. But now because of this game, I know how to conduct myself around small ghost children. They're human too after all, give them some space!

There were also like eight hours worth of slow-mo gunfights in the game which I can't for the life of me understand what purpose they serve. Maybe Chris Hansen's career on Dateline was more intense and dramatic than they lead you to believe."

76561197991441485,1292911891,True,One of my favorite FPS games of all time. A lot of elements of storytelling in this game were later found in BioShock. F.E.A.R. is a classic. Get it or I hate you
