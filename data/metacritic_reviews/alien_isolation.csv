JessiundNico,"May 18, 2024",10,"Absolute horror Banger which captures the original style of the movies. There is a good balance between Alien Terror and other threads after a hard scene you get some time to rest and the beautiful Alien classic music. While the story isnt the best of all time, it perfectly connects to the first movie and gives you a really well written Main Character to play (Ellen Ripleys Daughter). The Gameplay can get repetetive but how you solve the Situation is completly different in each scenario. The Nemesis System punishes you to play the same style everytime so sometimes you have to switch up your common playstyle which keeps the game fresh. 

To Youngproscia: Before you write an utterly wrong statement about a Game maybe complete **** to say the  Robots take to many hits maybe the bots arent made to be destroyed, they re there to distract and annoy you... and if you played the game more then 2 hours you would know that you get tool which makes the Androids one of the easiest things to handle. 

Enough to Youngproscia 

to sum up: you get a really good alien game where other franchises would cry to have this and if you love the movies you gonna love this"
Alex_Ozzy008,"May 18, 2024",8,"This game perfectly captures the look and tension of Ridley Scott's classic film. It's a clever survival horror entry that will appeal to fans of ""Dead Space"" and ""Resident Evil 7"". But unlike those titles, ""Isolation"" is a slower-paced adventure. You'll creep through rooms in order to avoid confrontations with human enemies and the alien itself. Of course, whenever the alien appears, it proves to be a frightening experience. This is mainly because the unpredictable movements of the alien are nerve wracking. And once it sees you, it's practically over. The gameplay itself is a little like the original ""Resident Evil"". You'll explore a giant space station filled with text logs and plenty of closed doors that can only be unlocked with certain actions. Eventually, you'll discover plenty of weapons and useful tools. You can also craft numerous items with loot that you find. The story itself is interesting and the cutscenes are done quite well. If you're a die-hard horror fan, you'll want to play ""Alien Isolation"". It's one of the best games based on an existing property. Overall, I would rate it with an 8.3 out of 10."
ShardITA,"May 15, 2024",10,"This game has everything a horror game should have and more. It's perfection.
The only negative things I can say are that it's kinda bugged at times and the story could have been written better, but thats it"
Youngproscia,"Apr 29, 2024",1,"Well I love survival horror and I LOVE Alien franchise ESPECIALLY first film so I so wanted to love this. But this game has no rhyme or reason. Missions are completely murky and not explained. The map is HORRIFIC and gives you no idea where you are going or why.
Items are so sporadic and then they make it next to impossible to craft something.
Robots can kill you with three grabs and it takes 18 melees to take them down. Wopeee this is so much fun.
Also, love the idea of 80s look, but it is wasted here . There are endless corridors that go nowhere and have nothing. There is almost never a reward for going off track, and the game does a terrible job telling you what track you should be on.
Story is really lame. You are on a ship with angry humans and an alien but no explanation is given for who these people are or how the alien got there.
Really poor poor   story telling.
The characters have zero color or personality.
The game can kill you whenever it wants with no logic.
I don’t understand positive reviews on this one . It’s like banging your head against the wall over and over.
Hard pass."
Hukkard,"Apr 8, 2024",9,"Alien Isolation genuinely creates a terrifying atmosphere : from the sound design to the stripped down HUD and through marvelous graphics, the game takes the player into a real experience. This opus combines interesting mechanics with an intricate mix of scripted and natural events making the whole game alive. The Xenormorph AI is an absolute masterpiece."

hhf2,"Dec 8, 2023",10,"How is this game NOT rated 90+????

This is one of the most immersive, story-driven and downright scary games ever made. I mean, mod this for VR on a PC and try to play it in a dark room, alone, at night. Tell me there's another game that delivers quite as well. It's ok, I'll wait..."
The_Mook_Man,"Dec 7, 2023",4,"This is a bad game, the alien is copying Conker's Bad Fur Day, except it's boring"
spexxa,"Dec 3, 2023",10,"Everything about this game is flawless. Its adherence to the graphics and style of the original Alien movies is flawless. The mood it creates - one in which you always feel in danger - is created by carefully designing the Alien such that while you can escape it, you would be wasting valuable resources. The story is sublime and Frictional have created a masterpiece."
AntonioLettino,"Nov 17, 2023",10,"The Perfect Horror

Alien: Isolation is an exemplary sci-fi horror film that tells the story of Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Ellen Ripley, known from R. Scott's film universe, who comes to Sevastopol Station in search of a black box from the tugboat ""Nostromo"".
One would like to say ""like mother, like mother"" because both the mother and the daughter will have to fight a murderous battle with a bloodthirsty creature from outer space.

Alien: Isolation starts slowly, slowly drawing the player into the dark corners of the Sevastopol station descending into chaos. Those looking for a well-known brawl straight from the Alien vs. series are here. Predator may be disappointed. It's a zero-sum battle between Ripley and the unnamed evil lurking in the depths of the station.

The atmosphere created in the game is extraordinary, absolutely unforgettable. The feeling of being isolated in a closed station somewhere on the outskirts with a predatory beast hunting you, mixed with mounting tension and a desperate, even hopeless fight for survival is the most unique experience I have experienced in video games.

I completed the title twice - the first time on high difficulty level, the second time on 'nightmare' mode. The first contact with the game and coming face to face with humanity's greatest nightmare is an unforgettable experience.
If we add to all this amazing music, which intricately builds the tension and atmosphere of horror, and a really well-rendered voice of the protagonist, we get an (almost) perfect horror movie. There are minor technical errors, but the entire title is crushing and jaw-dropping.

The game has been perfectly designed, providing the user with a real emotional cocktail in waves, attacking from the stages of tension through the dramatic fight for survival to the subsidence of emotions and a short moment to collect troubled thoughts - a revelation!
And the experience of how the titular Alien functions is... indescribable in written words. You just have to experience it. When you are walking around one of the seemingly abandoned wings of the station, a black, slimy, hissing alien organism suddenly emerges from the air vent, whose sole purpose from now on is to find you... and kill you.

Rating: 10/10."
Dimivog88,"Nov 14, 2023",10,Amazing game. Very stressful and a must for horror lovers. The alien is one of the smartest and deadliest enemies in videogames

jaaackyboyyy,"Nov 7, 2023",10,A Sci-Fi horror masterpiece that treats the IP with the utmost respect and care.
resU,"Nov 2, 2023",10,It took me too long to play this masterpiece.
HonestReviews66,"Oct 30, 2023",0,Decent atmosphere and good graphics for its day. But over-rated imo. The **** enemies just kill you in one second and I would have preferred more combat and not just stealth all the time. Repetitive structure. Good for a few hours but frustrating after that.
13runo2003,"Oct 21, 2023",9,"I truly think this is one of the best horror-survivor games of all time, if not the best. 
The atmosphere of being inside of this spaceship with this alien, thats its hunting you down, its truly one of a kinda, and the alien AI is one the best in video games.
A 7.9/10 is crazy for a game of this quality, not only a disrespect to this amazing game, but also for gaming industry in general."
Mike0529,"Oct 17, 2023",8,"The best feature about this one is the atmosphere, they did a great job recreating the first film of the franchise, and it is very interesting to know what happened within Alien 1 and Aliens. After you get the motion sensor most of the horror feeling goes away, but you can always decide not to use it. On the downside, there are some areas in which it is literally impossible to survive the creature, ending into some frustration. Played on Hard."
Haannss,"Oct 15, 2023",0,"Played it in 2023, graphics keep up with dignity and the atmosphere is quite cool. Mayor issues with the gameplay, though. The worst I've played this year to be honest. The game mechanics are completely broken. You see the alien through a window 20 meters away, turn around and in one second you have it at your back. Sometimes enemies see you 100 meters away, sometimes don't notice you 2 meters away. You have a gun but can't kill with it even an android. So what's the point of it all? Playing it becomes really tedious. Making a difficult game is not about making it random, nor unfair. I deeply regret having bought it."
ImStillOld,"Oct 11, 2023",9,"Oh boy what a game. Found this on sale 8e.
Atmosphere - Very intense, scary, panic!
Graphics - Still very decent (2014 game)
Sounds & ""music"" - Great
Story - Very nice going and interesting

Controls are littlebit slow, but it dosnt bother much after a while.

Very great game!"
somniphob1a,"Oct 5, 2023",9,"One of my favourite games of all time. I am a huge fan of horror but isolation is one of the games that geinually made me terrified. The story is phenomenal, and in 2023 is still a amazing game."

atyoukha,"Jun 20, 2023",9,"Intense and nerve-wracking video game that truly captures the essence of the ""Alien"" film franchise. Personally, ""Alien: Isolation"" delivered an experience like no other. From the moment I stepped into the claustrophobic corridors of the space station, I was immediately immersed in a world of constant fear and suspense."
Mipozipo,"Jun 10, 2023",9,"I love the alien movies so this game was defenitly a blast. They spend so much time creating the beautifull map and the alien is so well created because you never know when he will come. The saving system is just brutal. I dont know how many times I raged but it was fun.
10/10"
squarefenix00,"May 29, 2023",9,"Un imprescindible del terror. El ambiente es simplemente una gozada, te mantiene en guardia en todo momento. MÁS JUEGOS DE ALIEN ASÍ, POR FAVOR."
LoK2Nosgoth,"May 18, 2023",10,"Terriblement effrayant et aussi bon que les meilleurs films, jamais un jeu ne m'avais procurer autant de stress et d'adrénaline."
CoreGamer1408,"Jan 30, 2023",4,"A very contrived game that is kind of immersion breaking due to the Alien parts. The Alien doesn’t work in an Alien game. It moves all wrong on hind legs like a Tank and no wall crawling. It’s a one hit kill monster with god mode infinite health that cheat teleports all over the massive space station. When ever the Alien(s) appears it’s very contrived and immersion breaking.

Don't get me wrong it is cool to see all the Alien the movie style of analogue tech in a computer game. The game is is ok when facing off against humans and kind of fun when facing off against androids. At least the player has a fighting chance against those foes they can be killed/destroyed.

The clunky UI makes the player move like a geriatric. Yeah I get the limited save options at certain points was to create a certain amount of extra tension. As opposed to save anywhere at any time, but I found it just time wasting annoying and cheap when dying to the instant kill, god mode, cheat teleporting Alien.

Every games seems to need the obligatory crafting element these days, but it makes sense in a survival game using makeshift gear. Just throwing the very limited survival resources at the invulnerable Alien in god mode was a pointless drain. I only found the flametrhower the best quick fix to shoo the gawd damn thing(s) away anyway.

A missed opportunity for a really great game let down by really bad and cheap Alien game design."
vIPROLL,"Jan 29, 2023",10,I absolutely loved everything about this game. The atmosphere kept my adrenaline going and my need to survive. Only one other horror game got my attention and that was Dead Space. I have played this game several times and will again in the future. I'd love to see remaster or remake for the newer consoles. Thanks to everyone who made this game one of my all-time favorites
Morados9,"Jan 3, 2023",10,Y es uno de mis juegos favoritos absolutos de todos los tiempos. La historia está muy bien implementada y el detalle es increíble. La atención al detalle es excelente. El juego tiene una historia fantástica y está relacionada muy bien con la película.
Alvarito200609,"Dec 21, 2022",0,"The fact that the alien is there for 10 hours chasing you makes me think that this game is a bit repetitive. But for the rest, graphically it has aged very well since 2014. And the sound is incredibly good, as well as the setting that makes you feel horrified during the 15 hours of gameplay"
sbasxv,"Dec 4, 2022",9,"As close as we can get to Alien (1979) video game. Excellent atmosphere, story and world building."
hector_bcn98,"Nov 14, 2022",8,"Debió ser de los primeros videojuegos con los que de verdad pegué brincos del sofá las primeras horas. No por el alien, sino por los androides sintéticos. La santa madre que los parió, que a mi de pequeño me daban fobia los robots, joder."
vasilias21,"Nov 13, 2022",10,Just the best port at Nintendo switch.Maybe better at other consoles **** just feel like being in the spaceship.
mareknufc,"Nov 11, 2022",8,"Arguably the oddest game I've ever played. Oftentimes frustrating beyond belief but at the same time engaging. It offers substantial challenge to the players so beating it provides a sense of accomplishment.
Assets of the game:
- great graphics faithful to original Alien movie art design,
- Sevastopol station is the star of the show. Its has gripping history which you want to know more about. It also has a retro-futuristic good sci-fi vibe to it. Alas we'll never live long enough to see if XXII century humanity will colonize outer space and set up space stations like this,
- it has decent enough story - without going into spoilers department - albeit the conclusion feels a bit rushed and disappointing,
- tense atmosphere fostered by spot-on audio,
- wide variety of tools meant to help you deal with Alien, Working Joe's and human survivors. You gradually unlock new tools to make gameplay fresh,

Shortcomings of the game:
- very frustrating at times. Unpredictable nature of Alien guarantees many deaths that feel cheap and unfair. You almost get an impression that certain areas were meant to frustrate player,
- game in general is very confusing. It doesn't explain properly game mechanics. With Alien on your back the game turns into trial and error where you die again and again because you didn't know what to do or where to go. Map can be confusing as well and you can't really afford experimentation and exploration. I got really angry when I lost good chunk of progress because I got randomly killed by Alien while reading documents at terminal. As if the game was saying: ""Nope, we don't want you to get immersed in the game"" and **** you,
- repetitive nature of gameplay. What you're gonna be doing all the time is restoring power, starting generators, looking for keycards and running errands for your allies. It has a lot to do with another vice which is,
- the length of the game. The gameplay does not warrant a game this long. It could well be truncated in half. Endgame feels really forced,
- no manual save. Saving at designated points takes time and you are extremely vulnerable while trying to save the game.

Overall it's still a good game with some reservations. I think criticism from some reviewers (especially IGN) is valid to certain degree. After all it is an exhausting slog but perhaps that was the point of the game to begin with? After finishing the game it's a time for some reconciliation and unbiased approach therefore I give it a generous 8/10."
sEBq78,"Nov 8, 2022",9,"As a fan od Alien series i must say that game has averything. It looks good , game mechanics are very good and the atmosphere of constatn fear is just awesome."
Bosnae,"Nov 3, 2022",10,"This is the most tense game I ever played in my life! Even tho it's 2014 game graphics are still great and gameplay smooth. Everything in this game is made to be perfect stealth game, no jumping option, slow movement and fast hideout. On top of that when you add amazing horror background music, environment audio, futuristic interior design with computers resembling late 70's etc. thats a one star extra. No distractions with extra fancy stuff, in Alien Isolation less is more. Sega did overkill with this one! 10/10"
Agt_Killionaire,"Oct 7, 2022",10,"This is quite a horrifying game to play. From the high bass sounding steps of the alien to the quiet but loud attacks of people on the ship, I for sure like the game and am glad I played it all the way through."
Milkan,"Jun 21, 2022",10,"La joya de la corona de los juegos de Alien. Bien podría pasar como una Alien 1.5. Un juego que lleva la tensión a un nuevo nivel y el sentirse bajo una permanente amenaza del Xenomorfo es impagable. El mimo y el detalle es enfermizo, uno de los mejores juegos de la generación de PS4-XBOX ONE."
samuel426,"Jun 21, 2022",10,Con una gran ambientación y una inteligencia artificial muy avanzada hacen de este juego una verdadera joya del survival horror. Además la fidelidad a la película del 79 hará las delicias de los más fanáticos de la saga.
TakedownFrenzy,"Jun 9, 2022",9,"Alien: Isolation is everything a survival horror game should be - above all else, downright terrifying. Look deeper and the game's mechanics allow you to eventually outsmart the Alien in more and more creative ways. The long length is a bug bear for some, but if this game clicks with you you'll always be wanting more anyway. Replayability could be more rewarded, but this would equally take away from the constant feeling of being the underdog. Alien: Isolation ranks highly as a survival horror classic, misunderstood by large review outlets on its original release in 2014."
LGBTandDisabled,"Apr 19, 2022",2,"This may seem harsh, but when the weakest part of an Alien game is the Alien, that is inexcusable.  Seriously, you could remove the Alien from this game and it would be better.  There is nothing random about the Alien.  He is going to be close to you no matter what, the Alien doesn't obey the rules of the ship.  He gets to move in vents that you can't access.  It's really dumb.  Even when you know the scripted moment they put you in a dead end so you have no choice but to set off the scripted event.  Killed the immersion factor.  It's a linear game trying really really hard to make the Alien seem life like but it's just a SOLID FAILURE.  This game is still playable, just don't expect much from the Alien.  This game should should be called Isolation: ignore the Alien.  I was terrified when the Alien showed up, but not for long.  Sorry, I can't get over the terrible AI."
Unlorja,"Feb 19, 2022",10,"It is unconscionable for this game to have a Metascore below an 80 for critic reviews.  Apparently, the IGN and Gamespot reviewers ate a lot of paint chips as kids, to complain that a game that is played on the hard difficulty setting is too difficult and to say the Alien is only active on a few missions, when in fact it's only inactive on a few missions.  This game is at the apex of survival horror video games.  If you are a fan of the genre and love a challenge or a fan of the movies, this game is not to be missed.  I have never played a more intense game.  Your heart will pound from start to finish.  Who would have thought the creators of the Total War series would have manifested such a masterpiece?  Not I, but I am thrilled I gave this spectacular game a spin."
Dante-Bellin,"Jan 7, 2022",10,"Probably the Best survival horror game out there. The sound is a blast, and the atmosphere is really tense. And even in 2022 it looks so good, especially with the Alias Isolation Mod which injects TAA and kills the jaggies for a clean picture. Also, it is playable in 4K with a mid range graphix card and it runs just super smooth. It is one of my alltime favorite games, and I'm not even a big fan from the Alien movies."
darinho,"Jan 3, 2022",9,"Awesome game. Long, terrifying, great sound and environment setup. Heart rate go brrrrrr"
PoptartKing,"Dec 20, 2021",8,"Alien Isolation gave me anxiety attacks on multiple occasions. The highly intelligent xenomorph AI creates some of the most intense and horrifying experience I've ever had in a video game. The faithfulness to the first Alien film can be seen from the very start, and you can clearly see that the developers had a lot of respect for the franchise. This game just creates an atmosphere that is nothing short of uneasy, which is the exact emotion you want from a horror game. Sadly, Alien Isolation falls into the same pit as other horror games and drags on for far too long. It also lacks the polish that you would want from a game like this, but If you're willing to deal with these issues this is a must buy for any fan of the Alien franchise, or just someone who wants a scary experience out ****!"
ruddiman_,"Dec 17, 2021",10,"An absolute staple in horror gaming. This is one of the best fine-tuned hide and run horror games ever made. It introduces ways to fight back but keep authenticity to the Alien's true horror; as you can only ward it off, not kill it. Fans of the movies will be delightfully surprised to find that the atmosphere, sound, and overall feel put you directly into an Alien movie from the 80's!"

A little slow to start for me as I learned how the Alien worked but once I got the hang of it I was sailing until it learned how I worked. Stopped the repetitiveness in its tracks as I had to change up how I played. Outside sections were sluggish but picturesque. Upon completion this game had me googling ""games like Alien: Isolation"" I would definitely play a sequel"
Steyraus,"Jun 28, 2021",10,Simply one of the best Survival.horror games and one of the best games of the generation. This game was so good it would influence the most famous horror franchises games as Resident Evil 7 and 8 would borrow heavily from Alien Isolation.
Eluxi,"Jun 14, 2021",0,Awful non of the slealth works even when crouching non of the hiding places like lockers work the enemies always know your there even when your prompted to hold your breath and the amount of times an alien has chased me even though im stood there making no noise and im 2 rooms away.
JasonR98,"May 11, 2021",7,"I recently replayed this game having knowledge that I loved it the first time through when it initially released. I do really love the majority of this game however the fear factor fades after possibly half way through as you get used to the xeno being around by then. The AI for the xeno is mostly amazing and it is clear they put all their effort into that as the AI for the droids is pretty awful as they forget you pretty easily and they are pointless to fight better off just running past, the scavengers are also annoying and have clunky shooting and running like a Bethesda game. The game overstays its welcome and the final 2 hours are a drag to get through."
okay_jpg,"Apr 26, 2021",10,"One of the most terrifying games I have ever played. Being fully immerse into the world of Alien, with the amazing A.I. of the Xenomorph is a treat for any fan of the series. Most horror games suffer from having a terrifying start but losing steam, but this games keeps the train running through it's whole runtime. This is truly one of the best of the best from the horror genre."
lmcl05405,"Jan 12, 2021",9,"Cuando salió este Juego varios años atrás no me pareció interesante principalmente porque no me gustan mucho los juegos en primera persona pero me lo recomendaron y le di la oportunidad. Soy fanático de la estética del universo de Alien y este juego hace justicia a la misma y sobre todo a la primera película de Alien de Ridley Scott la cual personalmente considero como la mejor.  La experiencia de juego es bastante inmersiva y el juego transmite una tensión y ansiedad que jamás había sentido con otro juego antes, no es una experiencia divertida, digo esto por si alguien quiere jugarlo pensando en que es un juego divertido para pasar el rato. Alien es una una experiencia que recomiendo a cualquier jugador y la cual se debe disfrutar en difícil. Cómo lo jugué años después del lanzamiento el juego solo presentó un bug insignificante que no daño la experiencia de juego, las mecánicas del juego, el manejo de recursos y el sonido es de lo mejor. Un muy buen juego para los que quieren probar algo diferente y no les da miedo probar nuevas cosas"
Be11e,"Dec 15, 2020",9,"Accurate representation of the Alien franchise's retro sci-fi horror aesthetic and atmosphere.
You might feel a bit overpowered towards the end as you can easily repel the aliens with certain weapons, but most encounters manage to be very tense and unnerving.
Surprisingly replayable for a survival horror game too."

Pros : The atmosphere is just amazing and the map is really nice
If you looking for 'living the experience', go for it. If you liked the movie, I really think you will enjoy this game. Play with the headset, without a cat :)
Cons : the game can be repetitive, and there are 3-4 chapters that could not be there (especially at the end)
Really good game, even for people who do not like to make jumps"
Wwilliams23,"Nov 12, 2020",7,"I had fun with Isolation when I played it back in 2014. The biggest thing going for it is atmosphere, which is amazing. You're constantly stalked by the alien and it puts you in panic mode many times throughout. The story isn't anything special but the gameplay carries most of the weight anyway. If you enjoy stealth-horror games, this one does not disappoint."
mande77,"Nov 11, 2020",0,"It's hard to say much negative about this game. Having to construct supplies took getting used to, but it's a very creative and cool choice. The story was great, the cut scenes being better than some of the actual ALIEN films. ISOLATION isn't perfect, but if I've ever played a perfect game, the amount is less than 5, so that's not really a slam. The ending is shocking and impactful and awesome. The graphics are questionable at times, even in the remaster, but those are mostly great, too. Sometimes, the Alien is so difficult that it gets frustrating, but for the most part it's fine. The facehuggers are scarier than the Alien. They're frickin terrifying. ISOLATION definitely brings the horror, though, with one of the most all-around well-made games in existence. Screw the reviews, just hop in and pee your pants."
AngysYoungg321,"Nov 8, 2020",10,Amazing game! One of the best horror games of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!! Must play! 10/10!!!!!!
jon_king,"Nov 5, 2020",9,Nunca fui muito de jogar jogos de terror mas apaixonei por esse. Principalmente porque Alien tbm é um dos meus filmes preferidos e o jogo conseguiu recriar perfeitamente o ambiente do filme e trazendo ainda mais tensão com o Alien que me fez arrepiar desde que ele apareceu até o final.
OCDLancer,"Nov 1, 2020",9,"Great thriller! Changes game mechanics time to time to keep you on your toes, good graphics and scene staging. Feels like a good Alien movie. Only headphones."
omoattas,"Nov 1, 2020",10,I just finished the main story & this game is one of the best western horror games ever seen ... I don't know Why i'm not played it on the release date everything is bulids perfect... I feel sorry that AM not supportted them in time to purchese this awsome game in time... Hope I can see a sequall from the same devloper and SEGA soon & for sure I will buy the collection with Full price from begining this time.... Promise.
redwarriorktf,"Oct 30, 2020",10,Completely under rated game. I can't believe I waited this long to play it. Graphics are unreal even still. The tension and atmosphere are perfect. I feel like this is a true sequel to the first movies.
bhappenstance,"Sep 24, 2020",2,"This type of game only works if there is a rhyme, reason, and logic for how the player survives or is killed. If those mechanics are in place, then ""survival"" is based on your learning -- patterns, stealth, strategies, resources, etc. In Alien Isolation, you just die. You don't know why you died, or how to avoid dying the next time. You just die. Over and over again. If you survive, that survival is more likely a result of luck, not skill, not reason, not logic."
Montes6384,"Sep 16, 2020",9,El juego es increible en muchas maneras. Desde sus escenarios hasta sus inteligencias artificiales. Me gustó mucho este juego. Es un muy muy buen survival horror.
AgentoftheBat,"Sep 2, 2020",10,"Probably the best video game based on the ""Alien"" franchise. A proper, big budget survival horror game with some great nerve-shredding tense moments. How there hasn't been a sequel is absolutely mystifying."
Snipperclips,"Aug 20, 2020",6,"Alien: Isolation seemed like the perfect Alien game on paper, and for the first handful of hours it even seems to deliver on its promise on the strength of its outstanding art and sound that faithfully recreates the ambiance of the classic horror film. Instead, what was the Great Xenomorphic Hope ends in another disappointment for a license loaded with interactive-entertainment potential. It’s a shame that Isolation doesn’t track stats, because I’d be curious to know how many of its roughly 15-20 hours I spent hiding in lockers, staring at the motion tracker, and, most of all, how many hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times I died without a chance to save myself. It may seem strange to complain that a game’s too long, but when the genuine scares of being hunted by an unstoppable predator are so diluted by repetition and padding, Isolation’s epic length really does work against it. Someday, someone is going to make an incredible Alien video game that checks every box. But, sadly, Isolation is not it."
Wittyname,"Aug 13, 2020",0,Glitches make this the most frustrating game I've ever played. Cutscenes will not load and you are forced to go back an hour due to limited saving. While in stealth you will simply stand or walk through a solid object and are again forced to start over. Disgusting.
ViniciusFolly,"Aug 10, 2020",8,"""Alien: Isolation"" deserves praise for its attention to detail. Even though the game world is ultimately a decaying space station on the verge of being decomissioned, with rioting residents and a murderous unseen creature, the environment is incredibly lively and well presented. It actually looks like people lived there, went through economic hardships there, and sadly had to leave their homes and start over. You have a wide range of tools and weapons, which fit the game's progression quite well. The story is driven through context dialogue and archive logs, and cutscenes are (thankfully) very scarce. Item management is a must, especially for offensive purposes. On hard setting, enemies are though and require a lot of ammo/melee hits to be neutralized, constantly worrying the player about having enough resources to avoid being overwhelmed later. The Alien is unforgiving, and just the tension it causes makes the game worth it. The story is very long (19 missions), with many twists and turns, making you wonder what will come next.

I believe the game fails on human combat. Humans' A.I. is poor, and not at all dynamic. When they spot you they go: ""I will shoot you."" (3 second pause) *Pew pew*, and repeat. It breaks the ""serious game"" atmosphere, and makes you want to be chased by the Alien and the androids again. Shooting the head of an Android with the Bolt Gun is extremely satisfying, for example.

Overall, great game with minor setbacks."
CubiReviews,"Aug 5, 2020",9,"The first Alien movie is one of my all time favorites. And seeing how true to the source this videogame is, makes me happy. They really nailed the atmosphere! Seeing the Xenomorph for the first time in game was an amazing moment and after playing through this game multiple times it still amazes me how well the Xenomorph AI works. It's tense, it's frightening and it's just the way it has to be!

The story to me is the weakest part of Alien Isolation and the game is bit too long having some pacing issues. But the overall stealth/survival gameplay, the very good graphics and the superb sound design help to overlook the shortcomings.

Alien isolation isn't only the best movie license game, it's an excellent survial horror game!"
JDSCigano666,"Jul 28, 2020",10,Hands down the most atmospheric and terrifying gaming experience in existence. Still holds up after all these years and what a treat for Alien fans.

marpolaris,"Jun 26, 2020",8,"Excelente juego, me gusta mucho la ambientación retro futurista de  los escenarios  te hace sentirte en una película de alien"
DrummBumm,"Jun 25, 2020",7,"I agree with most of the reviews on this so I'll keep it simple..

PROs

- CPU AI is impressive (especially the Xenomorph, can be hard even on Medium!)
- Sound design (sets a tense and scary atmosphere)
- Player movement (Smooth)
- Overall gameplay
- Aesthetic and environment is it's greatest strength (also abiding to the Alien universe)

CONs

- Backtracking constantly
- Dying after progressing quite a bit before you can get to a save spot (can be insanely frustrating)
- Limited supplies and the weapon wheel is sometimes hard to navigate in the heat of battle
- Near the end of the game, the alien is constantly on your a$$ no matter how quiet you are, thus requiring a lot of RE-DO's
- Story wasn't that great. It followed the storylines of previous Alien's, but, I didn't find it very intriguing. But it didn't have to be.

Overall, I thought it was a really well designed game and I can't believe it took me until 2020 to play it! I love the horror aesthetic and sound design that went into this game. I really wish they would make a Predator game like this Alien game! It would be amazing to have to combat/hide against a smart A.I. Predator in this kind of single player setting. I think it would be worth SEGA or whoever else could develop a game like this to look into acquiring Predator's licenses for it, I would certainly buy day one of release.
The only reason I didn't rate this higher is because of the frustrating moments dealing with the Alien A.I. Even when you think you've outsmarted it, it finds a way to disappear and come bull rushing you from an unseen angle. This happens even on Medium, so I can't imagine the frustration on playing this on the hardest mode. It is rewarding to get through it, but, the frustration is more abundant than the reward IMO.
Worth a buy! But get ready to get beat around a little bit!"
Cameroncoles,"Jun 19, 2020",10,"Don't miss out on one of the best experiences of this generation.
It doesn't necessarily have the best graphics, story or gameplay when compared side by side with other games out there, but as an experience from start to finish, it was a masterpiece.
I really felt that from an art direction they perfectly matched the original Alien movie and the xenomorph was always terrifying. I love that you had to spend a lot of the game hiding or sneaking, because there was no way to defeat it."

MattchewHawk,"Feb 9, 2020",10,"A genuine 10 out of 10 game
It's not often that I finish a game, and instantly want to replay it again, but this was definitely one of them, in fact so far, I've completed this games 4 times and got the platinum trophy for it.
I'm usually not a fan of survival horror games, but my love of the Alien movies tempted me in, and I was treated to a truly scary, visceral and atmospheric experience. Visually the game is perfection, the light and shadows consistently keep you on your toes as you're always looking for a spot where the alien might pop out and finish you off, the look and feel of the world is completely authentic to the world of the original Alien movie too, down to the tiniest details.
and then there's the sound, this is the real star for me. you are constantly hearing subtle noises that may or may not be the alien as it hunts you through the map, you're never sure if what you're hearing was just a steam pipe hissing or the alien, you hear scurrying noises from above that make you freeze on the spot. You are engulfed in perfectly placed sound, headphones or a good home cinema is the way to go with this game for sure.
And then, there's the big chap, the alien itself. A huge slender, terrifying nightmare of a beast, it blends in to the pipes and shadows with ease and then in a split second its chasing you down, staying hidden is key, the visuals and sounds of the alien are as terrifying as the thought it could be around any corner.
With all that said, you cant put the game down, it has a real ""just one more checkpoint"" feel to it. You feel genuinely immersed in the game to the point that you'll think about the game when you're not playing it. And although you'll definitely die, a lot, it won't discourage you from trying again.
There are very few games i would give a 10/10 rating to. but this is well deserved. I'm hoping beyond hope, that this game eventually gets a well deserved sequel."
GameHermisimo,"Jan 19, 2020",8,Es un muy buen juego ya que te hace entrar en tensión constantemente y produce una sensación de adrenalina muy grande
Spainstrong,"Nov 26, 2019",9,"Es un pedazo de juego. Muy bueno por donde lo mires, la ambientación y el sonido te meten de lleno en la experiencia. Por no hablar de lo inmersiva que es la estación, tiene miles de detalles que te harán parar y pensar "" Dios, es que estoy dentro de la p*ta película. Si alguna vez quisiste sentir que sería estar dentro de una pelicula de Alien. Este es el juego definitivo."
TheScort,"Nov 14, 2019",10,"This game is a solid 10/10 title - so rare these days, but if you are a fan of the first two films (the rest got a tad silly) then this will certainly resonate with you.

Creative Assembly have managed to create a game that pays so much homage to the first film, you could easily be forgiven, to think they had a hand in that film - the ship recreates the old 70s feeling of scifi perfectly - you'll sometimes just stand in corridors in awe of how great they look.

As for the gameplay, it strikes a perfect balance of fear, exploration, problem solving and occasionally combat - you never actually feel safe when the Alien is around; and maintain the perfect grounding in reality - you truly feel like a fledgling human trying to survive.

It's such a shame to think that there won't be a follow-on from this game, as it truly is a masterpiece and will forever be a shining gem of this generation."
Peacecraft01,"Nov 13, 2019",10,"This game is a gem. I would say that for the PS4 this is my favorite game on the console to date.

Coming back to it every once in awhile is still a great experience, even though it will never feel like it did the first time I played through the game.

Alien Isolation has influenced in this genre a lot, but any of the games published after this have not got too much success. The main reason is the big amount of horror elements which can scare you and they range from the alien to humans or robots. They may not being new, but they are well-integrated and as result the atmosphere is full horrifying and you never feel safe."

I played the beginning with the voice detection system on and it was tense. Every little gasp of air that gets detected by the mic triggers the Xenomorph. And believe me, he'll find you. The whole helpless feeling gets amplified by use of your scanner and hiding skills.

This game pushes you to take risks and second doubt yourself if you should run or not. The alien is very smart and also extremely unpredictable. It may walk around in circles but I found that that the Alien can just pop out because of one small noise and keep scanning a different route than before."

Alvokun,"Jul 20, 2018",9,"I thought I was going to find this game repetitive and tedious, but the truth is that I have really enjoyed it from beginning to end.

Alien Isolation is more of a survival experience, less action-based than almost any other first-person shooter. Thus, its main strength is the atmosphere and the subsequent feeling of constant tension and fear, as the alien is invincible. The game itself recommends to play directly on Hard (as I did), and I can understand why because, albeit more difficult, it poses a more realistic challenge this way and it forces you to play wisely, hiding and saving ammunition. Even if you have not seen the original films, you may love the game as one of the best of its genre.

I have also played the two DLCs, though they are basically no more than a quick mission. Overall, I am convinced that Alien Isolation is a solid 9."
phoeniix23,"Jun 15, 2018",9,"What a game!! As an Alien fan, this gets a 10/10. From a gaming perspective, it gets 8/10 so I'm going to go for the middle which is 9/10.

If you are into the Aliens universe, and especially if you play this right after watching Alien and it's sequel Aliens like I did, then man oh man are you in for the most IMMERSIVE experience ever. The level design, the art, the graphics, the music, the voice acting, the lore, EVERYTHING makes you feel like you're in the movie but this time, up the fear by 10 times. You'll get sweaty palms, heightened blood rate and holding your breath so many times and when the Alien does get you, man oh man it feels real.

The motion detector mechanic is brilliant! Acts as both an Alien detector and as a navigator so it makes the HUD screen clean. I am a gamer who cannot stand busy HUDs and Isolation nails it.

As I said, from a gaming perspective, the only 2 points docked off, for me, was because of it being a bit too stretched out at the end, and after a while, the Alien doesn't seem as scary as the first few encounters and instead became an annoyance. They should have done more kill/death sequences so it makes dying more scary.

I love the scavenging gameplay where every resource and ammo counts.

I enjoyed the hacking systems. Man some can get really tense especially with the Alien hunting you.

I like that when you're moving around, the guns are automatically kept out of sight just as a real person would hold it by his side instead of having the weapon always taking up screen space. When you press the aim button, Ripley will whip out her weapon along with the crosshair right in front. It feels satisfying each time and more realistic. I wish more FPS games copy this.

I loved the lore hidden in terminals, it gives the world and characters greater depth.

I enjoyed the subtle environment story telling of the opening level. Pay attention to the interests of each crew member in their cryo chamber. I actually knew who they were before even meeting them. And was surprised by one of them. And predicted the nature of another.

I wish the dogtags collectible could have more meaning behind them. It made collecting them less enjoyable and meaningful. I wasn't invested to go out of my way to really find them. They could've provided more lore/artwork/music/anything for collecting them instead of just a picture and job description of each missing person. Maybe there's a bonus ending or video for those who found all of them, I dunno, gotta google it.

TLDR; SUPER IMMERSIVE TENSE FIRST PERSON SURVIVAL GAME. GET IT!!"

Ryko616,"Mar 2, 2018",10,"I guess Alien: Isolation is love/hate for most. This was one of the last games I bought for PS3, but never really got into it back then. Later on I gave it another try on PS4 and was absolutely hooked, after having searched a while for any good space oriented scifi-game. (There ain’t too many).

So why Alien: Isolation is good:
Controls, linear but intriguing maps which accommodate the story, optional item/weapon use and crafting, overall game mechanics just perfect on the par. And real tension one gets so rarely on todays (stealth) games.

After reading some negative reviews of this, the aliens random appearance (?) AI frustrates many negative reviewers, but I haven’t had any unfair play-throughs or moments from easy to hard difficulty levels. (Though there are a few specific parts where you need luck and/or a good headset not to die.)

Currently doing nightmare mode and still loving the game. For me this is one of those few games, of which I absolutely had to gain every trophy. More than often The Collection edition is on sale, so I recommend."

visiblelight7,"Jan 5, 2018",5,"IT gets a perfect 5/10 of which it deserved every single mark! The presentation , the sound and the atmosphere was TOP NOTCH. This game is quality but it had a core flaw that ruined it. They absolutely had the right idea and the talent.

Unfortunately, they completely ruined the game from being fun by turning it into a tedious fetch quest on a space ship. Basically, you spend the whole game being told ""get this generator. Push this lever, go to room C. Ok Go back and push the lever"".  I'm not kidding when I tell you that this is the gameplay. They throw in an alien in the middle while you do this repeatedly. It gets old really fast...

The game was trash to be honest. Don't believe me? Go ahead, you'll get **** in and enjoy the first 3 hours and after that....well... I told you so."
riquelmeone,"Nov 22, 2017",10,"I have read through some reviews, the good, the medium and the bad ones.
While I understand that the game itself might be regarded as quite long (I still do not understand how this can be negative though) and slightly repetitive in the gameplay I would like to focus on something different.
The game should be regarded more as a movie and as an additional part of the whole chronology.
It obviously takes part after the first movie and just does a brilliant job in recreating the original mood and atmosphere. The level design, even small objects, the soundtrack, the whole feeling you get is just so intense and gives you the feeling of watching a movie directed by Ridley Scott.

As the story unfolds you will of course come across some points of frustration.
For me those experiences were, however, fairly similar to the first two movies. And that's exactly what my point is.
You get a crazily good Alien experience for at least weeks.
I have played the game multiple times over the years and am still finding new things.
Essentially you can sort of create your own movie versions. The outcome will be the same, but you can decide if you are a brutal or harmless character.
I do not know what else to say, but similar to The Last of Us, Alien Isolation gives you more than just gaming experience. It really gets you into the story. For me this is what makes a great game.
10 out of 10 anytime.

If you are worried about the repetitiveness of the gameplay, consider using all the gear the game gives you. There are so many ways to interact (or get rid of) NPCs, androids or even the alien itself.
I found myself not being creative with my tools when I played first. Now I am taking full advantage of the complete gear and it definitely helped."

rafaaguilera,"Oct 8, 2017",8,"Being chased by a Xenomorph in this game was certainly the most terrifying experience i ever had playing a video game. That thing is really intimidating and its appearances are not scripted, so if you hear any grunt or steps, be prepared because the Alien may show up anytime and whenever this happens you need to desperately hide as fast you can or move way from him making little noise as possible, because if he detects our presence is game over! Escaping from him is not that easy, you need to be really careful! My heart went all over the place during these sequences and leaving this thing behind was a hell of relief. This is how a survival horror needs to be done, right? It's all about surviving, do not expect a war arsenal like Resident Evil 6 to help you, things here are very scarce.
So amazing was the level of production. Te environments are very rich, detailed and the film elements were perfectly translated to the game. The developers did a great job!

However, even enjoying (and i really did) my playing time exploring and trying to escape from the sinvastapol station, i felt that this would have been better if it was cut 5 hours shorter. I never considered to stop, but you can clearly see that the developers put some content fillers to make it last longer. I lost account of how many times i had to cross the entire station map to turn on a power switch to open a single door located really far, and once there, turn on another switch to open another door where i was before and still have to worry about the Alien showing up and kill me before i reach a save point. Really unnecessary, frustrating  and annoying moments that prevents this for being a perfect game.

Remark: play it on easy, it's hard enough this way."
DirigiblePulp,"Oct 1, 2017",5,"I don't get the love for this game. The stealth is atrocious. The A.I. is broken, it always seems to hover around you and can spot you through cracks and behind walls and if it gets too close. The alien doesn't move very smoothly. It walks around like a hulking nemesis most of the time, waiting to spot you instead of hunting you. First person controls are imprecise for stealth too, good luck trying to escape and do something with precision."

EwanD20,"Sep 18, 2017",10,"Alien: Isolation
I got this game in 2015, about a year after its release. And it's one of my absolute favourite games of all time. The story is very well implemented and the detail is incredible. Every panel has lettering and lights. The attentions to detail is superb. The game has a fantastic storyline and it ties in to the film nicely. The thriller elements of the game are good, it has your heart racing at points. Definitely get this if you have the chance. This gets a 10/10 and a huge thumbs up from me."
MilanYildirim,"Jul 5, 2017",10,"That game hooked me up to my ps4 for hours and l am not even into horror,survival games. One of the best games l've ever played on my ps4. On hardest difficulty game never lets you catch a break! I had a headache when l beat the game due to high level of stress."
BITESCREEN,"Jun 22, 2017",6,"Das Survival-Horror-Spiel Alien Isolation will vor allem eins: Den Shooter-Totalausfall Colonial Marines schnellstens vergessen machen. Das gelingt Entwickler The Creative Assembly schon mit der Optik: Von den in der Dunkelheit flimmernden Uralt-Monitoren über die eckig-sterile Architektur der Raumstation Sevastopol bis hin zum nostalgisch-piepsenden Bewegungsmelder adaptiert man den 70er-Look von Ridley Scotts Über-Science-Fiction-Horrorfilm Alien beinahe perfekt. Die Licht- und Schatteneffekte sind fantastisch, ebenso der in den ruhigen Momenten subtile, in den stressigen drängende Sound. Leider vernachlässigt man bei dieser stilsicheren Verbeugung vorm Vorbild die Pflichten eines Videospiels: Das nahezu waffenlose Versteckspiel mit dem Alien frustriert durch eine inkonsistente KI und nicht vorhandene Checkpoints, während immer gleiche Missionen das Spiel in die Länge ziehen. Glücklicherweise bewahrt eine beklemmende Atmosphäre und die audiovisuelle Brillanz Alien Isolation vor dem Schicksal seines Vorgängers."
Mac2311,"Jun 20, 2017",10,"This isn't a game for a passive or novice player since it will test you on how well you handle stress and takes time to try to understand the Xenomorph's world understanding and what it pays attention to. it's gritty and fascinating.

The world takes you back to the original Alien movie very well. it's a nostalgic ride but at the same time doesn't feel that it just uses that as cover for a crappy game. The stress in this game alone is incredible. you are trying to unlock a door and you can hear something behind you. hell, you can actually feel it behind you.

This game doesn't hold your hand and that I think is the best part. I feel some people feel it can be linear at times. I didn't feel that way except for around the first 20 minutes but to me that was them setting the stage and all the plot pieces.

I highly recommend this game to everyone unless you scare easily or you just like a laid back game. this is not for you."
badgerryan19,"Jun 19, 2017",8,"We FINALLY get a good alien game. The Alien's AI is so freaking awesome in this one. The game is also so terrifying at least for the first 6 hours or so and it starts to kinda loose steam, and I did feel it did drag on too long at around 14 HRS. That could of been trimmed by 2 hours or so. Still a good time though."
theeDarkhorse,"Jun 2, 2017",10,"Amnesia: The Dark Descent was great. It invented the genre. Everything that attempted to emulate it felt trite to the extent that i gave up on the genre. I avoided Alien: Isolation for two and a half years for that reason. The middling reviews confirmed my expectations. After 2 and a half years It was cheap enough in stores to warrant a go (It was the only game on the shelf i hadn't played)

This game gave me the experience you expect from a new console. It felt like Tomb Raider or Resident Evil on PS1. Turok on N64 and Resident Evil 4 on Gamecube. It feels new and exciting. Its genuinely tense. The sound and art design are hollywood level. Beautifully presented. Remember when you bought games because they were unique and fun as opposed to having the quality of being an update or a sequel? This games a reminder of that and I'm so pissed that i allowed external influences to prevent me from playing this. The reviews are mixed because not everyone has the same experience. The a.i makes each playthrough unique. Well done sega.  Games like this are the reason you invest in a games console."
tom_kirkland,"May 29, 2017",9,"Alien: Isolation delivers a unique, memorable and technically impeccable survival horror experience that does the revered Alien franchise proud. It perfectly captures the essence of the original film but also transforms its formula into something new and smart that feels like a natural evolution. The game's incredible atmosphere, sound design, setting, and mechanics make you feel vulnerable and build tension masterfully, but it also gives you power and capability as you progress, rewarding your hardship and fuelling your determination to survive. It cleverly builds on the Alien universe's lore and its narrative and characters fit in well whilst moving in a compelling new direction. The Alien itself is the game's star. its design is faithful to Giger's original, and its behaviour is well conceived and unscripted (for the most part), making it unpredictable and deadly. The game has breathed new life into the Alien and its AI is the best I've experienced in a game which keeps things interesting and intense. My only criticisms are that some of the tasks you must complete to progress can get repetitive and a bit of backtracking is involved when navigating. The single player story is long, intense, and full of twists and survivor mode offers a complementary, stand-alone experience with tons of replay value. Bravo Creative Assembly!"
SimbaUno,"May 19, 2017",7,"Overall, Alien: Isolation is a fun and interesting dive into the Alien franchise, one that anyone that is a fan of the series will enjoy.  The world is beautiful, the Alien is terrifying, and the lore is deep.  My complaints aren't much to do with the story or the characters, but the gameplay itself.  The controls feel clunky and many of the items don't ever seem that useful or helpful in most situations.  The map is all over the place and very hard to follow.  One thing the game nails is the theme of being alone and helpless.  I was legitimately terrified of the Alien and ALWAYS felt vulnerable.  If you are a fan of survival horror or the Alien franchise, this is a must play, otherwise there are other games that do a similar thing, but just a bit better."
BlakDak666,"Mar 23, 2017",8,"The Alien franchise has always been a mess: with terrible sequels in the films, terrible games in its universe and a mess of directions for its future. Despite the issues the franchise had, Creative Assembly were successful of giving players and fans alike a terrifying horror game that traps the original Alien film in terms of atmosphere and setup. The music is sparse, but when played make truly heart-pounding moments that intensify as Gigar's monster gets near you. The technology and retro style is pleasing visually and contrasts extremely well with the Alien as it passes through doors and vents to relive the tension of the first film. The Alien itself is a marvel of AI; though initially it had numerous glitches and bugs that made it hard to see, the post-patch AI adept of the Alien is shockingly amazing. It learns from your actions and strategies and makes pushing it away increasingly difficult and the death scenes at its hands are brutal. The hide-and-seek stealth with the Alien is a wonderful gauntlet that will see you dying and experimenting constantly.

Of course no game comes without problems, as the human and android encounters leave something to be desired, with bugged out AI and/or tedious shooting controls against them is far less fun and engaging.  The save systems are tedious to save at and can prove detrimental if you get killed quickly after. The story is subpar, with wooden characters (including the main protagonist) that makes anything memorable to them that the Alien doesn't amplify. The time trial based mode is alright, but the inclusion of season passes and modes for it just don't feel right. Admittedly, the story goes a bit too long (roughly 20-25 hours max), but I appreciate the attempt to making it worth it by the end. Alien Isolation is a great horror game that will scare you so dam hard with its main Xeno star and prove to be a possible comeback of the Alien franchise."
LordMOrion,"Mar 21, 2017",9,Graphically and plot-wise this is an all-time classic. The atmosphere generated in the game is an all-time classic for any form of media. If you want to literally walk around in Alien then this is the game for you. The narrative is phenomenal and engaging. However the game doesn't get a 10 as it is a little short. Otherwise a great success and I hope there is a sequel.
bellonman,"Mar 7, 2017",8,"If you enjoy the Alien films, this is like playing one out from start to finish. Not too much character development, but the game play keeps you engaged the whole play through. The Alien was a really sporadic enemy that kept me on my toes at all times."
dyinginbeauty,"Feb 24, 2017",9,"PHOAW!

I got this on sale on PSN for £9.99 including all DLC - anyone who likes horror games or is into the Alien franchise should give this a go. It is brilliant! The atmosphere, the sound, the tension, and the possibility of multiple styles of play (use distractions or choose full stealth) in a game that tests your patience is why this is a real gem.

It misses out on 10/10 due to pacing issues - it drags when about 50% through."
mash27,"Feb 15, 2017",10,"This game is a masterpiece of atmosphere, immersion and tension. The vibe of the movie is carefully recreated and the attention to detail is amazing. Only noobs and morons would give it a low score."
Odogreviews,"Jan 24, 2017",9,"Alien: Isolation is a horror game based off the original Alien film created by Creative Assembly and published by Sega. Alien: Isolation is one of the best horror games I have ever played. The game is not perfect and suffers from a few flaws but is overall an excellent experience that should not be missed by fans of the survival horror genre and fans of the original Alien film. Alien: Isolation is the first real AAA horror game to have come out in years that focuses on pure horror over constant combat and empowerment. Alien: Isolation breaks the convention of traditional horror games by including less combat than even the original masters of survival horror such as the Resident Evil and Silent Hill franchises. The graphics are stunningly detailed and look almost photo-realistic at times. The fog and light effects are impeccably designed and really help add to the game’s amazing atmosphere. The alien model is well designed and so are its animations which really help intimidate the player. The setting of the game Sevastopol is well designed and full of detail that makes it look truly lived in and real. I found the character models in the game especially corpses looking wonky compared to the game’s detailed setting. The lip syncing is also bad during cutscenes and in gameplay. Luckily they are not a lot of human characters in the game so this did take that much away from the experience. The excellent lighting makes up with this issue times making the character models look better. The androids that chase you out throughout the station are excellently designed as cheap knock offs of the ones in the films. The sound design is first-rate and really adds to the games uncomfortable claustrophobic atmosphere. The noise on the 80’s tech is loud and booming and so is the score. The noises the Alien’s makes are quite horrifying from the thud of its clompy feet to the heavy breathing of the alien and pounding of your character’s heart make the atmosphere thickly repulsive. Alien: Isolation tells a good narrative that stays true to the original movie but suffers from some pacing problems. The game stars Amanda Ripley the daughter of the protagonist of first movie Ellen Ripley. I recommend that it is best to see the original film before playing this game because the narrative expects that most players have seen the movie at times. The narrative is slow paced just like the original film. The game does not suffer from the same ludonarrative dissonance that a lot games suffer from where there is a conflict between the story and gameplay. Amanda Ripley is a simple engineer and is not a powerful fighter and there is next to no combat in the game to tell that story accurately. I enjoyed every minute of the game but I felt the story was too long and drawn out than was necessary and had a bad cliffhanger ending. I found the gameplay focus on evasion over combat an excellent design choice. Alien: Isolation decides to give the player some weapons including a pistol and shotgun for androids and human enemies but are best not used at all because they often attract the alien which can one hit kill you. To stay true to your character most of the gameplay consists of doing repair work to the station to find a way off. The game has hacking mini games for unlocking doors and computer terminals and superb crafting system. The beginning is tense and only introduces the alien only a few hours in than having it appear right at the beginning. Encounters with the alien are tense and uncomfortable and make the player feel vulnerable due to the Alien’s advanced A.I. The game uses a checkpoint save system where players go to phone booths to save which added to the game’s tension. The player is given a motion tracker that can track the alien and enemies in the area which makes encounters even more horrifying. I liked that the game has many difficulty selections for the player to choose. The Alien can be cheap sometimes. Later in the game a flamethrower is introduced that cannot kill the alien but if used can scare it away which balances the difficulty. The human A.I. on the other hand is extremely dumb. The humans in the game seem to have no self preservation skills and summon the alien killing them and you. The androids which I found at first creepy slowly became a nuisance throughout my playthrough and will often grab and stun the player forcing the player into a QTE event. The game at one point skid the line of ludonarrative desidense by throwing a few hordes of androids at the player. One complaint people have told me about the game is the backtracking which I did not mind because it made me feel familiar with the station and allowed me to see the changes I have caused to the station. Alien: Isolation is an overall excellent game. The game has a few flaws that hold it back but Alien: Isolation’s model for survival horror should be used by all horror games coming out in the future.

Archulysses,"Dec 12, 2016",7,"Story - The game is the direct sequel from the critically acclaimed 1979 Aliens in which Amanda Ripley, daughter of the movie heroine Ellen Ripley, is on her quest to find the whereabouts of her mother and know what happened to her. This leads her to the decrepit and mad place of Sevastapool of which is full of desperate and aggresive individuals trying to survive and the dangerous xenomorph which is the titular alien in the game. The story for me is really average at most and the characters tbh, are forgettable and no one really gave me that emotional impact to feel bad when they die. Overall, it is your typical survival horro storyline with really no new things to show you. A fair score of 5/10

Gameplay - The gameplay can be two ways depending on your enemy, if you are against humans or working joe's you can either play stealthily or play aggressive against them. However, playing stealthily is your only choice when you are up against the xenomorph since that thing is almost untouchable and invincible. guns are useless against it though you can use fire to scare it away. Overall, I really loved the AI of the xenomorph, in fact, it is the most advanced AI i have ever encountered in all my gaming experience, it will adjust to your playstyle, will look on places you usually hide from and will ambush you and trap on some parts of the game, it is masterpiece level of advanced AI mechanic. I really loved it that it gave me the greatest of my scary and uneasy moment ingame. However, the cons of the games occurs on the second half of it when you are up against the working joe, the game will turn from a stealth game to a shooter/action game. Of which despite the aggresiveness of the joe's i never really felt interested in that part of the game. A score of 8/10.

Graphics -  As to the environment, i really loved it. From the narrow corridors, the smoke coming out of the pipes, the numerous tubes you see, the destroyed surrounding. etc. is spot on and gives you that scary and uneasy feeling you should feel in a horror game whether or not enemies are around the corner. The xenomorph design is also detailed and really put their effort in gving it life. My issues in the game is the facial expression of the characters though, they look like they have no emotion whatsoever, Amanda Ripley in cutscenes you wont know if she's scared, worried or angry if you look at her face. Everyone in the game looks like a robot without much face movement. Still though, a good score of 8/10 will do.

Music and Sound - Out of all horror games i played, this game has the most haunting soundtrack i have ever experienced. I cant stop my heart beating from the loud music that plays when the alien is around and looking for you and in timed sections in the game. It also has some haunting music in dark areas in which you are alone and exploring. As to the sound, Voice acting is average if not good. while the sudden loud sound is good and the xenomorph's screams when it saw you is shocking at times. Really a good sound and music system to give you that horror experience. A score of 9/10

Overall score = 7.5

Creative Assembly really put a good effort of making this game. It is haunting, scary and will give you that adrenaline rush in pressuring parts of the game. It needs some improvements, but overall, it is a really good horror game out there that deserves your attention. I was dissapointed when IGN and even Gamespot gave this game bad review of which it doesnt deserves thats why bad sales came to its way. I hope there is still a chance for this game to continue since i enjoy to play it."

sjwilkin,"Nov 14, 2016",9,"Arguably the best in survival horror, drenched in tension, fear and excitement. The game isn't designed for gun-ho gamers running around shooting everything so be warned, you must treat this as if you were actually there! Slow, steady and very quiet. Most of the time you feel helpless as you can not attack or defend very well and the Alien is an instakill - but be patient, weapons come slowly and by the end youll feel fairly confident you can keep yourself alive no matter what the situation. Top of the line graphics and audio recordings just help make this thee best survival horror around and arguably one of the best ever. More please."
Morshlac,"Oct 28, 2016",7,"this game does a lot brilliantly but some things badly also, and in the end could only really recommend to lovers of the franchise.
And on the plus side no game has ever come as close to the tension of the movies. Long terrifying moments exploring and hiding from the alien are when this game are at its best, the whole setting and music is very close to the movies and really well done.
unfortunately though as the game drags on and on the ""unlock, retrace large map area with alien to find key/generator etc""...dynamic gets staler and frustrating. gameplay becomes a chore long before you finally get to the end.
Some brilliant moments and genuinely terrifying at **** there is a lot of room for improvement overall I think there's a lot of games I enjoyed more.."
Ishi123,"Oct 27, 2016",5,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
Tselel,"Oct 13, 2016",8,"Story/Campaign - These are the words to describe the two halves of the game, first half = TERRIFYING, INTENSE AND NERVE-WRACKING, the titular ""alien"" of the game the xenomorph is the worst nightmare you will encounter in the game. Its AI is so advanced he will adapt to where you usually hide, where you go and what you do damn sometimes he can even show he is better than you though sometimes too it is very questionable and a head scratcher how he could teleport from one place to another (Hard mode). Still though, a memorable and awesome horror experience will come your way. As for the next half = BORING AND ANNOYING, this is the part where you will fight a new enemy, the working joe who isnt a one hit kill to you unlike the alien and this is the part where the game becomes a semi shooter/melee gameplay if you dont prefer to use stealth. Nothing was interesting and the game becomes slow and boring in this part. As to the last moments though, the only thing i will say on this is that the game suddenly throws EVERYTHING AT YOU. As for the story and characters, the protagonist Amanda is the daughter of Ellen Ripley (you know who that is if you are a fan of the alien series) and the story revolves of Amanda going to Sevastopool to look for the flight recorder left by her mother. The story is your typical survival horror game. The supporting cast overall are forgettable and uninteresting, nothing really reason given for you to care for them. Ill give them a good score of 7/10 for this.

Gamplay - Really, the gameplay of this game is good. despite it being your typical fps stealth game. The real strength of this game are its enemies especially the xenomorph, It is one of the best if not THE BEST AND MOST ADVANCED AI i have ever encountered in my gaming life. He will adapt, hide, corner you and trap you if you arent careful and **** working joes on the other hand despite being dumb moving blocks are however, relentless and hard to kill. The humans in the game are just your typical mobs in every game, whoot you when they see you and hit you when you are close. Another good score of 8/10.

Graphics - Everything in this game from the environment to the detail of the characters are on spot. I love the smoke that comes out in every corridor you passed through, the paintings and blood on the walls and the lighting of the game. The character design are good and kinda realistic though i have a problem in their facial expression being expressionless and looks no life. A score of another 8/10 for me.

Sound - Well, the soundtrack are DAMN SCARY. It really fits the game perfectly and will really race the beat of your heart in those moments where the alien is around the corner or is chasing you or in those timed events where you will do puzzles. Its music and soundtrack really is the main reason of terrifying you. A score of 9/10 for me.

Total Average = 8.1

Personally, this game is the best horror game in the current generation we have, nothing really was much scarier and intense like what this game did to me. I was really dissapointed on how the gaming reviews like ign and gamespot gave this game bad grades for ""being hard"" and ""too advanced AI"" which really destroyed this game financially. I really hope a sequel and more improvements will be done on this game. Thanks."
XxJoseManuelxX,"Oct 9, 2016",6,"Alien: Isolation is an action-adventure, stealth, survival horror video game developed by Creative Assembly and based on the Alien science fiction horror film series. It was published by Sega.

- Tediously Slow and Boring Some Parts
- Loses the Fear"
ExtaticGamer,"Sep 14, 2016",8,"This may just be the most nerve-racking game I have ever played, and I'm not a stranger to horror games. The alien is hands down the scariest video game enemy I have come across in a while, due to his immortality, and its intelligence that evolves throughout the game, designed to counter your play style. Not only that, but the atmosphere is set in such a way that even when it seems that that thing isn't around, you still feel tense because of the sounds that the station makes, such as pipes creaking, etc. Lighting effects have to be seen to be believed as well. The story is interesting and the crafting menu is easy to grasp. Definitely worth a try if you're a horror fan."
GoodApollo88,"Aug 24, 2016",9,"Finally a great Alien game which also does Ridley Scott's original justice. The nostromo is wonderfully designed and looks great in its simplicity. The gameplay very much requires you to craft items as tools for your survival and to use your wits and instinct to hide. Run and deceive the xenomorph which is ready to seal your fate. The motion tracker is your primary survival tool and is essential as an Assault rifle is in C.O.D. An extremely tense experience with an eerie soundtrack to match. When you do get to grips with firearm in the game, gunplay does feel a little wonky. The xenomorph looks amazing and is the star of the game. Creative assembly have really done their homework. One of the gamea of the year and definitively the scariest"
JoshBtB,"May 18, 2016",9,"In a world lacking in multiplayer experiences to be shared with friends living in the same house (us accounting for a huge population of the 21-35 bracket: one of the biggest gaming markets there is *ahem ahem*!) we make do with shared games, a unanimously decided game to share and play only when we are together, as a three.

Mortal Kombat X was the first (when there was 5 in the houe) but a considerable Mortal Kombat experience gap between two of us and the rest meant it soon fell short in popularity - two quickly returning to their rooms for Fifa and Fifa alone... forever.

Following that, months and months later, once it was just three in the house, along came Alien: Isolation - the best collective gaming experience I've shared with friends since the days of split screen, made up games on COD with buddies and uni and at home.

Of course Alien has no split screen - but when it comes to horror, a couple of buddies by your side helps to shake the fear of being mini-mouthed by the huge hulking horror. Unlike the comando-type versions of the franchise with Isolation you're back to OG Ripley basics: one ship, a few stragglers/survivors and one apex predator: Alien.

You slip in to a room only to hear the rumble of the vents in the next, the huge metallic thump as something weighing three times as much as yourself crashes without caution to the ground - the rippling hiss as it snarls, inhaling the scent of the area, ushering fear in to your human heart, only a worthless pistol with 3 bullets to hand, pipe bombs won't save you now, only creeping, hiding and sweating your palms beyond reason might just help you avert the gaze of the huge shadow of a beast that is stalking it's way towards you.

The rattled beep of a motion sensor, impaired unless you are facing directly towards the target, becomes an all too familiar friend and foe. Your friend when you know the Alien is only several steps around any one of several corners (for every seven steps you take, Alien only needs one) but your foe when your feet away from an objective leaver or bit of intel and that crusty *bleeilp* sounds off, the rumble of a monster in the ducts above... or is it below... letting you know that objective is potentially a disgustingly long, terrifying minute away now, as you're in a room with no hiding spots and you've got maybe five seconds to leave it and find somewhere, ANYWHERE, before he/she/it comes'a lumbering your way.

Graphically it's spot on, you are on the cliche ship, the sliding doors, the bare cables and vents, the 70s vision of the not too distant future; minimalism is the only type of home-comfort style you might find in a small dining area or suit-up room. Otherwise it's corridors worryingly long, loading bays and tight squeezes. Though visually, in spite of the dark and the spray of foggy gases, the sparks of a cable can be stunning, the occasional glimpse of the open void of space through a window a breath of escapism relief from the horror you run from once you turn your head from the pane (out of which you can see the scale of this concrete jungle-hulk of a space-station that has now become the hunting ground for one extremely alien jaguar) and head back in to the dark.

Combat is risky and fun. Enemies non-human come in the form of bizarre AI that would never bother to sprint but once they've spotted  you, the glow in their eyes and the relentless march is enough to send a concise path of escape in to a frantic dance in to a dead-end corner, only to be violently wrenched around and thrown in to the wall by a less than welcoming off-blue cybernetic creature; ""you should not be here"" it tells you, far too calmly for the blood shedding pummels it's delivering to your frail, fleshy face.

You are Ripley's daughter. You are relatively alone. You are the born survivor who, as of yet, I am unsure but hope is here to eventually take down this beast.

As a collective game, we're really enjoying this one. We take it in turns to squeal with terror and joy as we see our more panicky friend make ridiculous wrong turns whilst being chased down by the screeching Alien, only to somehow, by the width of a hair, lose the line of sight and slip somehow beneath a table... unseen... escaped; but hilariously the wrong side of the room/current floor - something that might have taken us 10 minutes to previously get to the right side of. We use our collective brain power to remember pass codes and room numbers and we're constantly back-seat gaming, offering our four extra eyes to spot out enemies, potential loot or mysterious vents. Opening up that map and sharing route tactics to avert the killer on deck.

Sonically this game is just as terrifying. Our surround sound magnifies the scale of the ship: the huge booming and creaking of unknown mechanics clunking in the distant, the shudder of an elevator, the loudness of your steps in the ventilation shafts.

I don't know how you make this game better - but I don't know that any game is 10/10"
EliteGames,"May 13, 2016",8,"AI is an underground hit honestly.  This game should have done better then it did, but unfortunately didn't get enough publicity and the run and hide gameplay honestly wasn't for everybody.  Seriously though this game really nails the Alien world atmosphere and what it would be like to deal with one of these beasts.  If you haven't picked this game up yet, I would recommend doing do as quickly as possible and at a great deal now to boot.  You will be playing the best game of hide and seek you've ever played."
looom,"Apr 24, 2016",2,"Mediocre game - Sneaking, crouching, find that, bring that there - story is like "" I don't care"" AI of Alien is cheat, it always follows you whenever you go. Initially game is scary however at some point it become boring. crouching, move, turn off/on power.... I am glad that I bought it on promotion for about 12 euro...  Save your money, don't buy it."
Dead_Head,"Apr 4, 2016",9,"Amazing game. Great story, graphics, gameplay and pacing. Don't understand the bad/mixed reviews...This game is definitely worth picking up, especially if you're a fan of the Alien franchise. Stay's true to the franchise and is a fantastic new entry into the story arch. The only complaint I have is how poorly the character animations were handled. The voice acting is top notch, but the character mouth and face animations are awful. At times during conversations characters mouth's won't move at all, making it difficult to tell who is talking to you. Certainly not a perfect game, but the hands down the best Alien game I have ever played. Giving it a 10 to boost it's overall score since it is most deserving of a better score than it has received from critics."
SlightlyAbovAvg,"Mar 24, 2016",10,"This game is simply incredible.
The fact that this game was made by Creative Assembly, who has only done strategy games before, this game is an impressive feat. The game's main focus the alien is extremely well designed, with both its look and its A.I. The Alien learns your behavior every time it sees you and adapts to any situation you through at it. Throwing a flare to distract the Alien worked at the beginning of the game, but by the end whenever I through a flare the Alien would look at it for a split second and then search for who had thrown it. The Alien once was easily swayed by fire, but as time went on whenever I raised my flamethrower the Alien would back off on its own and instead search for a way to get behind me. I don't understand how its done exactly, but the AI is the best I've ever seen in a video game.
The humans and androids are less so however. The humans will still react to every movement, but for some reason even knowing that an Alien is around would fire as many shots at me as they could. The Androids were just annoying. Always spotting you at the most inopportune times and alerting the Alien by making noise as it walked slowly toward me. I loved it.
The other NPC's seem to just be noisy devices that hinder your movement and attracts the Alien and in some ways the human response is understandable. Not really knowing what they are up against and scared out of their mind and all. The overall game is incredible believable. I haven't played a AAA horror game like this in a long time and I wish that a sequel or something similar to this comes out in the near future.
Alien: Isolation is Spectacular."
illphil,"Mar 19, 2016",8,no more 1's or 10's.  this a solid 8.  great fun if loved the alien movies and want to experience it firsthand.  its basically just sneaking around doing fetch quests and fighting occasionally but its dripping in atmosphere and looks and sounds good to boot.  its hard but thats part of the fun. for a low price u cannot go wrong!
McBains,"Mar 3, 2016",2,"Before you decide to waste a weekend on this you must and I do not think that it is a spoler but will rather save you some time, you must know one thing and ONE THING ONLY:

The ending...what a joke. Not even an attempt.

Really after going through so much with your character and the game forcing you to sneak SOOOOOOOOO much...
you get what is over in 2 seconds and while the credits role it leaves you with your mouth open thinking ""dont those guys just **** on me?""

If you are like me and are looking for a complete package, story wise and just demand a LITTLE closure(funny as it is one of the themes of the **** game),

SKIP THIS GAME! It is not worth it. Trust me.

All the best."
noahbruhh,"Feb 19, 2016",8,"Scary as hell, especially hen you see the alien in all its glory, prowling around sniffing the air for your scent. This game pays great homage to the original movies with very detailed environments. this game is also pretty lon. the only bad thing about this game is the story can get a bit boring at times, the graphics are treat as well."
redblue87,"Feb 10, 2016",10,"Best surviving action story available on PS4. Good, long and tense campaign, nice gameplay, immersive enough and played in complete dark quite scary even for experienced players.

Surely underrated game, delivers good quality game at a very cheap price currently."
Termin8ter,"Jan 31, 2016",8,"Alien Isolation is exactly what the Alien franchise needed after the terrible Alien vs Predator games and the awful Colonial Marines. The whole game, you're running away from something you can't hide from or fight against, and the Xenomorph's  AI is very unpredictable. What you get is a finely polished horror experience, that gives us what Colonial Marines should have given us. The graphic are also amazing, giving everything finely tuned details, that make you think that you're inside the movies. I do have a couple of problems though. Halfway through the game, the sense of tension goes away, and never comes back, which is sad. Apart from that, Alien Isolation is an overall solid Alien game that you should definitely pick up."
shahdan,"Jan 21, 2016",10,"If there would be two words for this game then it would be “Near Perfection!” Yes, it is all what a game can achieve as nothing quite grazes the ‘flawless’ mark. And for that I am unabashed to offer a full score as the game delivers what it set out to achieve. What more is desired? Nothing at all.

Alien Isolation is a game of cat and mouse, and for all the hoopla and petty click-baiting (and the subsequent long whining sessions stretched across a couple of Ryan’s embarrassing circle-jerking videos) generated by the incredibly mentally channeled reviewers of IGN and Gamespot (and even Polygon) or that god awfully imbecilic Quarter to Three reviewer, it is a game that plays completely fair; it just punishes you for all the right reasons.

Shocking isn’t it? But had dear ol’ Ryan and Co McGees decided to actually read the instructions the game hands out like candy all the time, and maybe (just maybe) light the dimply lit corners of their heads to actually see the clear cut instructions at the bottom of your constructed gadgets, we wouldn’t be in this mess. Or perhaps, look a little carefully around as the items are plentiful, even in Nightmare mode.

Yes, AI plays completely fair and without giving much (as I want the review to be as spoiler free as possible), I would offer a few lines on this. The game is incredibly tense and at times very unnerving. You are literally the mouse in this game who is up against a cat armed down to its last … err … spiked tail?

Well, the analogy is as fitting as it can be as the Alien is a deadly killing machine with incredibly honed senses. You would come to know a deadly adversary in the Medical Bay, as when the leash is off the Alien, it’s just you and it one on one. And all you can do is survive. Yes, people, THIS is the point of the entire game; Survival.

You are literally stripped down to human level and I love the tiny details, as for example when you are putting bullets into the empty barrels of the revolver, Amanda’s hand would shake sometimes and she would do it slowly. Why? It makes sense. She is an engineer not a preposterous Space Marine but an ordinary young woman thrown into an impossible situation for which strategy and quick-wits are your sole modes of survival.

True to its word, the game tosses confrontations (for the most part) out of the window as it’s a hardcore Stealth game dealing with nothing but survival first and everything else later. You are facing a gargantuan threat, an unstoppable force and an apex predator. How do you think it should behave? It should behave unpredictably.

Yes, the Alien is a tough, unpredictable foe. It doesn’t care about your frustrations (I never had them), but only how it shouldn’t see and outwit you. I cannot imagine the infamous Medical Bay sequence going any other way imaginable as its second (or 3rd entry if you count the Axel cutscene) entry here is nothing short of spectacular.

Provided that the player takes notes of the impossible number of easy hints the game keeps throwing at you, I cannot imagine anyone dying in that heart-pumping adrenaline inducing sequence more than 2 or 3 times and that too on Hard Mode.

Your quick wits is all that is needed. And isn’t this the entire point of the game; outsmarting a deadly threat? It just is and its simplicity is even further reinforced by the persistence of the threat.

To be honest, if you love games that demand the attention span **** and draw despicably unintelligent (shoot stuff, save every nanosecond, tell you where to go because, apparently, you cannot read a map a child can) crowd, then AI would prove to be something out of Milton’s parables for you as the manual Save Points and lack of pointless arrows pointing at directions (bar the obvious Motion Sensor aid) would frustrate anyone with a subpar attention span.

This game is a challenge and it proves so by putting you in very different situations to judge your capabilities as a player. You think the Alien is in vents? Try to sneak past humans or Synthetics. How fast are you in these situations to come up with an exit plan? Should I make a noise with firearms or a noise maker and risk drawing its attention or is stealth my option … or is drawing the Alien to hit it with a Molotov more up my alley?

It’s this mixing up of situations and multiple climaxes that hit the nail on Survival and the never-ending tension. You are made to feel vulnerable … and boy is the game apt at this play at mortal fear.

The pacing is incredible, and yes, people a story can have multiple climaxes. Ryan and Co never read anything beyond menu screens for good literature to fall back on as that criticism was probably one of the most idiotic things on the internet; nothing but incredibly ignorant individuals trying their hand at literary devices. I felt nothing but second-hand embarrassment.

A tense Survival game; it would be a crime as a gamer to pass it up as it's a surreal experience par excellence of a lifetime!"
iCSiMarcelinmBR,"Dec 26, 2015",10,"Alien Isolation delivers one of the most harrowing and unnerving survival horror experiences in years. Capturing the vibe of the first film with absolute precision.

the sound design and presentation is impeccable, the alien an unstoppable force whose unpredictable nature makes every second of the game feel nauseating. The voice acting is sublime and it is a universe to get lost in (no pun intended)

Creative Assembly have not only created one of the best survival games in years, but one of the best alien franchise experiences since James Cameron's sequel in the 80's.

it is claustrophobic, violent, heart stopping and you will die over and over again.

the ride will be worth it."
lizardking420,"Dec 19, 2015",7,"Amazing game with some huge flaws. You'll never find the cart to move in rhe first 1 hour. You have to approach it from a wierd angle. Too much back backtracking. The autosave, it's suppose to be hard, but its way too long. Its like playing super mario again i have to play the entite game over. I dont like repeativeness ita no longer that immersive.  Memorzing a Safe path is pathetic. You will stop being steathy and follow the path of least resistance. The ai repeats so thats going to happen. Again stoo making me do thinfs over and over, if there was more ai depth. But elevators and cutscenes should be autosaves i dont want to see them again. Selectable if you choose so. Other then that its a great game. Beat stealth action game. Probably since the first metal gear solid, but seriously flawed. It does alot right but fails in so many ways. Would give its much better review but im only 7 hours in. It also has some replayability but its ai is not very dynamic."
sefrabu,"Dec 18, 2015",7,"This game will make you throw your controller across the room as you used to back in the days when games were actually challenging. It will beat you black and blue, rip your intestines apart and spit in your face. And you will be still coming back for more."
TEDD95,"Dec 13, 2015",9,"Let's start off by saying that this alien is a real bad ass stalker, I was so intimidated at one stage I spent about a half-an-hour hiding from it in locker and eventually when I summoned enough courage to go out in the open it dragged me out of a vent.

Besides the Alien, I love the level design, sound effects and even the lifeless androids. This is a really good game with some interesting gadgets and a really good take on exploration. As a person who is not keen on alien scifi stuff, this game really probed me in a special way... So my advice is if you never played or checked out this game make it a must play, it really deviates from the repetitive titles we finding today."
Leonchi970,"Dec 7, 2015",7,"The story mode is interesting, and the game play cool, but repetitive. There's no online mode, but a Survive Mode. But we have to play if we want to play other modes and maps."
BetterThanSonic,"Nov 30, 2015",8,"This game is scary! Yet, it isn't as scary as how terrible games like Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Heroes, Shadow the Hedgehog, and Sonic Unleashed are."
wing1,"Nov 27, 2015",10,"When I would go into my local Gamestop to purchase a game, I would see this on the shelf and be scared away by IGN's review.  I would always pick it up and think that when the price would go down, I would buy it and wouldn't care as much.  One day I went in and it was on sale used.  I purchased it and went home where it sat on the shelf for a while.
One day when exhausted from work and chores, I popped it in and WOW!!!  I was completely surprised.  This is the most impressively scary and one of the best playing games I have ever played!  I rank it right up there with the very best.  It mimics the Alien movie theme perfectly.  Everything from computers to the mechanics of the alien are very realistic to the movie.  The alien is scary.  I have played through this game 3 times and the alien still makes me jumps and has me scared out of my wits as I crawl through as quietly as I can trying very hard not to attract it to me.  There is never enough fuel to make me not fear this beast!
IGN dropped the ball on this one!!!!!  Buy this game!!!!!"
GuyFromFinland,"Nov 24, 2015",9,"First, this is the scariest horror game what I have played. The game isn't gore and the jump scares will not cause a heart attack. Nope. The game atmosphere is very intense. You can't run away, which creates more excitement and fear feeling. You're in space, without knowledge of the can you survive until tomorrow."
drlowdon,"Nov 23, 2015",5,"With its excellent presentation and fantastic audio Alien Isolation captures the feel of the movies better than any game has done before, unfortunately the game built around it just isn't particularly entertaining.

Even by survival horror standards the gameplay is very slow paced and almost entirely involves sneaking around the space station pulling levers and pushing buttons as directed hoping not to be spotted by enemies, enemies that include other humans, androids and of course the Alien itself. The game does feel suitably tense on occasions but even this is spoiled by having to constantly repeat up to 20 minutes worth of gameplay every time you die (and that's something that will happen often). When you are sneaking along the same corridor avoiding the same enemies for the third or fourth time that tenseness more often than not gives way to boredom and, as a result, I gave up on Alien Isolation well before the 20 or so hours it supposedly takes to finish."
homer4president,"Nov 18, 2015",8,"After playing the horrendous Colonial Marines, I was very skeptical about this game. But I'm glad to have been proved wrong. Although there were some levels that seem to drag a bit too long, Alien Isolation restored my faith in the Alien series. The gameplay is genuinely creepy. I'm happy to report that the Alien is scary again!!!!"
wade22fan,"Nov 16, 2015",6,"Alien: Isolation is the highly anticipated horror title developed by The Creative Assembly and published by Sega. You are put in the shoes of Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, who was played by Sigourney Weaver in the films Alien and Aliens. The game takes place in 2137, 15 years after the events of Alien and 42 years prior to Aliens. The creators of Alien: Isolation do a fine job crafting their own story and tying it in to the old films. The game even opens up with a VHS-like 20th Century Fox presentation. This makes Isolation feel like it fits right in with those classic horror flicks. As Amanda, aboard the space station Sevastapol, you must find the flight recorder of Nostromo, but things take a turn for the worse as you discover an alien is on board, relentlessly killing all crew and passengers.

The first thing you’ll notice about Alien: Isolation is the presentation. It opens like a movie from the 70’s, with those classic VHS lines and quality hitches. It’s complete with retro music too. You’ll literally feel like you are watching one of the old Alien films. Soon enough though, after a somewhat laggy but mostly realistic cutscene, you’re thrust into darkness and horror. The opening gameplay set pieces truly invoke terror. The superb graphics help add to the realism and fear. The detailed environments make you feel as if you’re really in Amanda’s shoes…and you know you are not alone on the space station. Lighting effects are especially great, along with the little things, such as smoke and fire. Everything looks pretty darn good. The weakest aspects, visually, would probably be the characters themselves, but they still look great. Being that you have little ammo and minimal weapons, it’s easy to be afraid in the opening stages of the game. The sound effects are implemented with precision, as you can hear every detail around you. Sometimes, it’s the alien scampering around in the air ducts, while other times, it’s lights exploding or enemies approaching. Whatever it is, you’ll be impressed and probably pretty scared.

The gameplay in Alien: Isolation is good, but not great. Sure, the visuals and audio are both superb, but things tend to die down and unravel in the latter part of the game. It is about 20 hours, which some claim is too long. This does in fact, water down the experience because the story and gameplay wither after a while. If the game was only 10 hours, the game would have actually been better. For example, later in the game, you get better weapons, which sort of defeats the purpose of what the game originally set out to do. You will feel overpowered, even though you can’t kill the alien. Also, the alien ‘disappears’ for a while in a certain section of the game, which leaves you to deal with the computer-generated human-like enemies, who are albeit creepy, but are not as imposing as the alien. All of this combined makes for a less impressive second half. On the positive note, the gameplay gets some diversity via the weapon/item crafting and puzzle-solving. The crafting is very much like The Last of Us, as in you combine different pieces of scrap you find throughout your quest and build items such as noisemakers, first aid kits and mines. The puzzles in Isolation are somewhat easy but they are also needed, because they freshen things up in cool ways.

The alien itself is pretty scary, but the real fear comes from trying to proceed to the next objective without being seen or found by it. Most of the time, you’ll have to be very patient and of course, stay hidden. There are plenty of places to hide such as lockers and boxes. Near the beginning of the game you will get a radar device that tells you where the alien is, or more specifically, if it is near you. By the way, it’s much faster than you, so if it sees you, you’re dead. There will be times you’ll have to re-play certain areas, which will become frustrating for some players. But then again, it’s all about survival in Alien: Isolation.

As a whole, Alien: Isolation nails the look and feel of the classic films it attempts to replicate. The developers did a nice job tying the story into the original films as well. This adds some cohesiveness and intrigue as you play through. The audiovisual presentation is fantastic. However, even with its strengths, Isolation fails to capitalize in the long-term, with a transition from fear and terror to guns-blazing, overpowering gameplay. This also takes away from the story because it changes the whole mood and feel of the game. Isolation is also upwards of 20 hours long, making things drag for too long. It’s not the Alien game you have been waiting for, but it’s still the best Alien game on the market today."
Laser0pz,"Nov 15, 2015",9,"This is quite possibly the most stressful game I have ever played. Playing through on Hard mode the first go, it's taken me 10 months on-and-off playing this game.

OptiMystik,"Oct 18, 2015",10,"It's really awesome! Just outstanding game in survival/horror genre. Atmosphere, sound, graphics .. all is fantastic! Many thanks to Creative Assembly for such pleasant surprise for all Alien fans especially after Colonial Marines fiasco. It feels like Ridley Scott himself help them with the game. So it's horror game and it's audience is not so huge as shooters and so on.. so if You don't like true horrors, this game is not for you."
Puffer2002,"Oct 18, 2015",9,"This game captures exactly what an Alien game should be: a tense and terrifying thrill ride that captures the precise look, sound and atmosphere of the original movie. Although the ending is a little stale (and I won't spoil it) and makes you question what the developers where thinking, the rest of the game is absolutely phenomenal and must own for fans of the franchise or horror games in general."
BaronMonaco,"Oct 16, 2015",9,"This game is a love letter to the original Alien movie(s), far away from all the shooters Sega used to deliver with this franchise.  Creative Assembly clearly loved the world created by Rydley Scott and wanted to stick to it, simply adding a new story and it gives a great Survival game.

First thing first technically the game is flawless, very good visuals at the time, specially the astonishing light effects which was so important when you're fighting for your own survival in a space station, the IA is also very good (the androids are more predictable, the alien is a true hunter) maybe even too good in the hardest mode where the alien seems to always know the room you are in (well at least this mode was really challenging), the sound is also excellent and a true provider of stress, like it should be in any good horror game.

The story is also a true selling point, it's generally this point that makes the difference between mindless gore and an engaging story that will make you care about all the horrors that you see, and with isolation even if it's clearly a mix of the 3 first movies with new characters, it's very well done with good voice overs. The campaign will hold your breath approximately 15 hours, which is a good average for a survival, even if I would have loved if they add some optional quests (others than collectibles) that would give you more resources/gear and extend the game.

Gameplay wise, the game is pretty simple: run, crouch, hide, collect resources, make an item (a few of them are truly useful), but effective, it would have be nice if there was more interactions with the decor, maybe in a sequel, but I don't have any big complains about it, it was very entertaining to play and it worked well.

Sega just said they weren't very hot for a sequel (even if it's without a doubt their best occidental game since years) due to sales that didn't match the expectations (without being a failure), I'll strongly advice them to continue with the "" Isolation franchise"" after years of bad games  Alien finally regain some good publicity and hype, please build on that and more and more gamers will buy Alien games.
And if you're reading this and still on the fence whether or not you should buy this game, my personal advice is : if you like survivals and/or Alien movies then YES, absolutely !"
SicknessInc,"Oct 16, 2015",8,"Well let's see. I have given the game an 8/10. My reviews are only based on the play/fun factor. If you want graphics then check videos on YouTube. The graphics are nice though. So is the sound.

So do I think you should play this game? That depends if you like a challenge (I played through on HARD), if you like ALIEN and if you like sneaking around. I can say yes to all of those questions.
This game got quite some **** because the Alien is so hardcore. Well duh, it IS the Alien. I mean, have you ever watched the films? The Alien is badass. As a human you are royally f*cked. So that is what I expected. The game manages to get it right. Being hard, but not unfair. Something loads of game developers never manage to do.

The game also captures the whole ""Alien-feeling"" REALLY well. You feel that you are in danger and when one of those synthetics sees you and starts talking and you just panic thinking ""shut up shut up!!! The Alien will hear us!!"" And then trying to hide. Ach, a great feeling. There are also a few nice twists in the game.

I can't really write any more without giving away the story.

So in short: you like Alien, you like a challenge, you like stealth? Yes? Then play it.

Thanks for reading."
Velsuan,"Oct 3, 2015",7,"That's a decent game for sure. Not as good as SOMA (more recent this one). The production value is really nice. Graphics are superb. In the sound department, that's a joy! The Alien is a s.o.a.b, and sometimes he seems a little bit too persistent (like mentally ill ""focused""!). I've found that if you don't hide inside a box or a locker, the beast tend to keep his distance a little more.... and that walking is an option as long as there's shadows. I almost forgot about the story... err, maybe because the Hide & Seek game with Big Al is waayy to tedious and repetitive. I don't know. I'm not that impressed about that aspect of the game. Good game overall."

valtorf,"Aug 31, 2015",10,"This is a real gem for anybody who love sci-fi and and watched Alien movies in the childhood. Such games appear once in 10 years. It is created with great love and attention to smallest details of the Alien world. Walking around on the space station alone would have made this game worth playing. But with an alien aboard it becomes one of the best thriller-stealth-survival experiences of all times.

I'm really hoping for a sequel to this."
DrakeGarrison,"Aug 26, 2015",8,"Alien: Isolation is a first-person survival horror game which captures the fear and tension evoked by Ridley Scott’s 1979 classic film. Players find themselves in an atmosphere of constant dread and mortal danger as an unpredictable, ruthless Xenomorph is stalking and killing deep in the shadows. Underpowered and underprepared, you must scavenge resources, improvise solutions and use your wits, not just to succeed in your mission, but to simply stay alive."

zmmby,"Aug 13, 2015",9,"Well, i dont know what to write tbh. Im speachless. This is one of the best horror experiences i've had since Dead Space, Silent Hill.

You can tell the love from the developers to this game and its pretty accurate. The enviroment is even more scarier then the enemies, and i've never experienced such stress and tension like this before.

The game is beautiful in its own way and you feel like a 12y helpless little girl struggling for your life.
I love it! Amanda is weak but smart. Opening doors takes time, and distracting your enemies will benefit you later in the game, due the weak choices of weapons.

The only thing i would complain about is the human models of this game and how they move. It's not the best and it feels like budget when you talk with other survivors.

Other then that, this is a really good game. But it's horror-survival. So this aint like dead space when you just stomps on enemies and shoots everyone. This is more like Thief + Silent hill.

Pros:
Graphics 9/10
Sound 10/10
Gameplay 8/10

Overall, im satisfied. I completed the game yesterday, gonna take a break for a few days and play it again on Nightmare mode.

You dont really have to be a Alien-fan to like this, i like the movies but im no geek within that area, yet i loved the concept and the idea.

Hoping for a sequel. This is a fantastic game."

obligatory_user,"Aug 8, 2015",8,"I almost gave up on this game.

I only purchased this title because of the strong reviews, and through some odd disconnect in my brain I didn’t clue into the fact that I didn’t much care for the 1979 film or survival horror games in general.

The first few missions did nothing to alleviate my concerns, either. The opening chapter was rather abrupt, not much in the way of introduction to the characters or the situation before you were thrust into the thick of things. The dialogue wasn’t particularly noteworthy, the graphics were solid (if a little plastic-y), the cutscenes choppy and stiff, even the plot elements were tired and an obvious rehash of Alien stories gone before. It didn’t help that I saw Dan Abnett’s name in the credits, a comic book writer whose work has never appealed to me. After the first couple of the hours, the game became a chore to play and the only reason why I continued was because I had already spent $40 on it, and also because I had a walkthrough that guided me through every step of the way.

Then came the first cat-and-mouse scene with the Alien and I was hooked. I think this might be the first game I’ve played where you are essentially powerless. You can never actually kill or even harm the creature; even when you acquire the flamethrower and more powerful IED’s, at best you can only temporarily distract it. I’m used to playing invincible, genocidal powerhouses, so this was an exciting and exotic feeling for me. It was also rather novel that the noise from running and even the light from your torch can alert an enemy to your presence; combine that with the first-person gameplay and it almost feels like this is all happening to you, not you’re avatar Amanda Ripley.

From that point on, my enjoyment and appreciation for the game only grew. The story still isn’t strong enough to stand on its own; without the gameplay, I’m not sure this would be anything but a blatant and someone unimaginative rehash of the first movie. And if you break down the gameplay, it’s rather mundane; throughout the entire game, all you do is go from one end of the space station to the other flipping switches, pressing buttons and taking out the occasional android.

Regardless of that, somehow I’m still impressed by how enjoyable the game is. There isn’t one particular aspect or feature that I could point out as the key to what I liked. Rather, all of the little bits and pieces that went into this title (which I’m sure was the result of a very extensive and exhaustive production period) add up to a unique but very exhilarating package. I still used the walkthrough for the remainder of the game, but only because I’m somewhat OCD and didn’t want to miss any of the audio recorders or ID tags.

Still, it doesn’t quite work as a horror game (if that was the intention). The scariest part of the game for me was the initial mission when you first arrive at Sevastopol, before you encounter any humans, androids or aliens. It seemed like every step you took, no matter how carefully, no matter if you were standing or crouched, made an unbelievable amount of noise and I was terrified that something would leap out and devour me. The silence was deafening; before I understood the rules of the game and how it worked, anything was possible—especially since I hadn’t seen the alien yet and didn’t know what form interactions or combat with it would take. All I heard were constant creaks and buckles, hinting at the danger that lurked just out of view.

But, as soon as I reached a corridor and someone ran across a hallway in front of me in a very obviously scripted “jump scare” bit of programming, the game stopped being scary. Sure, it was still intense at times, especially when I was hiding from the alien, sneaking behind tables and crates for minutes at a time. But if it did finally catch me, it was more frustrating than frightening, mostly because I’d have to start again from my last manual save (having no automatic checkpoints was a nice touch).

It also didn’t help matters that while the AI was certainly better than most games, it still had some glaring flaws. The fact that I could be crouched only a couple of feet from a passing android or alien and it STILL wouldn’t see me (and this was on HARD difficult), when in real life I would’ve been easily detected by peripheral vision sort of broke the immersion.

Overall, this was one of the better experiences I’ve had on the new generation of consoles. I finally took the plunge and bought a PS4 last October (coincidentally, around the same time this game came out), and this is only the second game I’ve played that’s made me think I made a wise investment (the other, of course, being The Witcher 3). If, like me, you’re tired of what has so far been an unremarkable couple of years for games, you should give this game a shot. It takes a little while to get going before it **** you in, but once it does be prepared for one hell of a ride."

neil77,"Jul 28, 2015",10,"Truly the greatest game I have ever played!  If you choose to lose yourself in the atmosphere, it will take you right into the heart of the alien universe. Every step is an achievement as you cautiously follow the path from start to finish from one glorious save point to the next, unaware of the terror that awaits the next turn.

A great story to add to the movie franchise and plays mostly on the suspense of the first film. It does have its action points too which break up the pattern nicely when needed. These are not of any fps standard by any means but that's not really what it's all about.

For those like me, fed up of the open world games, spending hours achieving very little on side missions, it sets the stage in a linear design with a more direct story driven approach. For me, this classic format triumphs every time in holding my attention, maybe not for you if you prefer your freedom to roam, though there is still plenty opportunity to search areas for items and build your weapons cache.

Some say the game is too long, some mock the alien... All I can say is that beginning to end, I immersed myself in the surroundings and used my imagination to bring the game to me and didn't stop to even think about any negatives. Neither did I feel I was let down by either of these points anyway.

Remember, you're playing for fun right? After all, surely that's what great storytelling and game design is all about? This title has all of this for sure."
nascent,"Jul 12, 2015",9,"Alien Isolation is a fantastic yet frustratingly and punishingly hard game. It's great atmosphere, and style of gameplay create a true survival horror, akin to Resident Evil. The level and equipment design are straight out of the Alien film universe. Retro tech mixed with sci-fi weapons, and dark, creepy organic alien nests. flickering lighting, and dark areas that can only be viewed by torchlight, which of course has low battery make Alien Isolation a perfect spiritual sequel to Alien. Ammo is practically non-existent, and weapons are found much later than you'd have liked to receive them, but this is all part of Isolation's charm. This isn't the typical action/shooter game that is more similar to Aliens, this is a survival horror where all you can try to do is survive.

The enemies are relentless, and literally nothing in this game is dumbed down for you. If you're clumsy enough to get seen by something, be it Alien, human, or Android, you will regret it. If your reactions are fast enough, you may be able to hide and wait it out, maybe not, and even if you do you still may get found, maybe not. Your pursuers don't give up as easily as you'd expect from other popular games, and puzzle elements of the game can cause you to get caught while you back is turned.
All you can depend on is your motion tracker (which doesn't work properly in hard mode), and even then, it will sometimes delay in showing you an enemy, or will randomly beep where nothing is there.

Quick-time events are saved for simple gestural tasks, such as pulling levers and blowtorching doors open, but kept away from enemy battles which is a compromise I'm very happy with. The controls otherwise are straight forward and navigating levels and solving puzzles is relatively easy to figure out but also challenging. (There are a few puzzles/minigames when 'hacking' that are not as well explained as others, and I feel could've used more than a few words of what buttons to use and more about what the goal of the puzzle is though).

The biggest flaw of Alien Isolation is just how punishing and relentless some enemies can be. Even quite early on, I came to realise the typical trope of hiding and waiting out the enemy before re-emerging and continuing on is fairly useless here...there's even a hint during loading screens warning you hiding is only ever temporary. You cannot wait out an Alien, it'll always stay close by, and your motion tracker only shows you a small area nearby. So if you hide somewhere and come out of hiding you may find yourself coming face to face with the Alien. Also you will be overheard using motion tracker if the enemy is near enough.. There break standard tropes and I love the game for it, but after dying 50 times in a row trying to get through a corridor or two it will start to frustrate you. Supposedly only a fifth of people that play Alien Isolation complete it, and I'm not that surprised. Even on normal difficultly it will put you in situations that cannot be beaten by skill, only a mix of luck and skill. In one particular area (fortunately near a save station) you must circumnavigate multiple armed human enemies and an Alien, yet sometimes they attack each other, sometimes not, but either way you will still be the primary target if seen. Another part of the game I feel is flawed is the crafting system. I don't feel it was explained well, and honestly I don't find any of it particularity useful. Smoke bombs/noise-makers/flashbangs won't work on all enemies, and for the ones that do, it won't work for long. If anything it'll slow you down too. Pipe bombs are the one useful tool in this game, but the ability to make them is rare. Medkits seem like a false hope, if you get seen by something you will be killed. I do wish that the crafting system was simpler and had more merit, or just didn't exist. You can't craft ammo which is the one thing you would want to have.

The characters and the acting is great, the enemies and npcs move realistically and calculatingly. The sound effects perfectly complement the level design, and build suspense and tension. The plot is revealed through documents on terminals, and through audio tapes, as well as the cut-scenes and character conversations. To me Alien Isolation is a perfect spiritual survival horror successor to Alien, and also to the survival horror genre, with very similar gameplay style as the original Resident Evil.

If you like Resident Evil, or survival horror in general, or just love the Alien franchise and don't mind that this isn't an action/shooter, then you will love Alien Isolation. Save often and use your motion tracker constantly. Patience is your best friend in this game, and if you do get frustrated, take a break. You will die, and die often, and there are times it will feel like it's not being fair, it's not. Just persevere and enjoy the atmosphere. If you can't sneak, then run and hide, either way you'll probably die."
MaximumD,"Jul 8, 2015",8,"Alien: Isolation is a game that is a must for a any fan of the Alien fiction. The production values and attention to detail in terms of the original film are fantastic. This could easily have been the sequel to the first movie. The Alien itself is terrifying yet fantastically detailed and creates tension throughout the whole experience. Honestly, technologically the game is brilliant, especially the sound. However, I still can't get myself to give the game a straight 10 for a few design issues, namely the spacing of the save points and ultimately too much exposure to the Alien.

At first I almost hung up the game completely out of frustration. I died a lot during the first main Alien encounter and had to restart countless times. There was a lot of trial and error and many things I didn't understand. I got killed hiding in lockers too petrified to move for fear of having to reload again. The Alien seemed to just be everywhere and I had no chance but get my brains pushed out the back of my head over and over and over again. I nearly quit the game at this point, but boy am I glad I stuck with it.

I gradually came to see the genius of the save system. Without it I would not learn how to survive against the Alien, since I would have nothing to lose if I could just reload wherever.  I realized that I started adapting and learning the nuances of how the Alien moved and sensed. I was learning how to survive against it and gradually started to make it further and further on every attempt. I really needed to be aware of how the level was laid out  to understand where the Alien was lurking. The sound cues are amazingly well done and after a while everything becomes second nature. The game strikes a perfect balance between the tension of getting caught and the thrill of pulling off a risky move to get through a room and to (relative) safety. Mix in some human enemies and the game really took off as I watched the Alien rip some poor shmo to shreds while cowering under an operating table. Reloading was no longer such a pain since I was learning how to swiftly move through a level with carefully calculated risks and shrewd use of gadgets. Basically, if you stick with the game long enough, you will eventually ""get"" it and it becomes quite enjoyable.

In the end though, there is just too much Alien and too much sneaking around. You end up seeing the Alien so much that it just kind of loses it's terrifying nature. When you eventually get your hands on a certain weapon later on the Alien becomes more of a nuisance than a real threat, although it will still surprise you every now and then. Simply put, the game is too long and It has too much backtracking and sneaking around non stop. Objectives are essentially the same as you need to trek through a long level to get some thing in order to power some other thing back at the start of it. The whole time the Alien is prowling around but at this point you'll have it completely fooled.They needed to change it up a bit further along in the game. It got to the point where I was just racing to the end to finish the story.

The sum it all up, this certainly a great Alien game first and foremost, but also a really solid survival horror game, at least in the very early parts. The Alien starts out as an absolutely terrifying antagonist and then sort of loses it's luster form overuse by the developers. Still, a solid 8 out of 10 for the technical achievement and definitely the best Alien game ever!"

papadrew7,"Jun 22, 2015",8,"Great survival horror game. I'll say this game is not for everybody but if you are a fan of survival horror or a fan of the alien franchise than you will enjoy the game. The game captures the look and feel of the alien franchise very well and it captures the claustrophobic and terrifying feeling of being trapped on a spaceship with an alien that has an intelligent ai. I'm not saying this is the greatest survival game ever made but it deserves its place next to silent hill, resident evil 2, and resident evil 4."
Jollukka1,"Jun 21, 2015",9,"Alien: Isolation is very harrowing horror game. It's not the scariest, it doesn't contain lot of brutal or jump scare -scenes, but sound design and atmosphere are like Alien -horror movie. You are not alone. You can't run away. Hide and survive. // 9 points"
PhilosophyRex,"Jun 17, 2015",9,"Un videojuego que provoca tensión como pocos, gracias a su tremenda ambientación, gráficos, doblaje, jugabilidad y efectos de sonidos, bestial, extremadamente recomendado."
Proctorious,"Jun 11, 2015",10,"This game is one of the best this generation, I can't believe how much this game was overlooked with critics and users, it has a very small but dedicated fanbase and I am proud to say I am one of them, this game exceeded every expecation I had for this game, it was simply unbelievable and should be praised a lot more, anyone who is a fan of Ridley's classic will love this, 10/10"
aaronb0209,"May 5, 2015",5,"i bought this game just last week and expected more from it. i don't like it. i will not say it's a bad game but it's just not my type of game that's why i gave it a 5. i find it boring, sometimes it takes long to actually know where you are and what you must do and where you must go."
GlobalNightmare,"Apr 30, 2015",10,"A true next gen title. Looks amazing, sounds amazing, and tells a story worthy of a hollywood blockbuster.
Alien fans get all the fan service they're looking for here, and more. The Alien itself is truly frightening, and really does feel alive, almost as if its being controlled by a human player. The best AI I've encountered anywhere.
Its not an easy game, and does require patience, but an experience and tense as this, is not to be missed."
Wade_VC,"Apr 18, 2015",10,"This is, without a doubt, one of the most intense, adrenaline-fueled horror survival games I have played in many, many years.

The atmosphere and tension is truly awe-inspiring, the graphics are exceptional, and the overall game-play is just amazing. Coupled with some of the best sound ever to appear in a video game and an exceptional story to tie everything together, Alien Isolation is a gem **** that will keep you on the edge of your seat for many, many enjoyable hours.

If you like horror survival games, this is a must-have on every level."
gamingfanatic,"Apr 9, 2015",10,"This game really exceeded all my expectations. i absolutely love this game, it's even better when you play it in the dark with no lights on and curtains drawn. This is my second most favourite survival game i have ever played as this really delivers on SEGA's promises. But my favourite part of this game is the story as players immerse themselves into the world of Alien. I would say this game is a definate buy for all survival fans, horror fans, even for the players who are looking for a great game to play through."
Alexgunner,"Mar 31, 2015",10,True to the original film an absolute joy to play. Great story with very tense moments which will have u hiding behind your controller. A must buy!!!!
mhay78,"Mar 28, 2015",5,"Unfortunately for me Alien Isolation is almost unplayable. This is the first game in almost 30 years of playing games that makes me feel physically sick. Of what I have been able to play of the game I can say the sound design is great, atmosphere created in the slowly falling apart space station is good. Certain minor gripes include not being able to jump or climb over small obstacles like a couple of suit cases or over e barrier etc are a bit naff in this day and age.

The rectile is small and hard to see and certain crucial items and gear are easily missed. I've only been able to get a couple of hours into the game so I can't say how nerve racking other bits are but then this is my review based on my experience."
WilmarMarquetti,"Mar 19, 2015",10,"As a middle-aged player i'm i little bit overwhelmed of brainless action games. There are zillions of FPS games available so why i really enjoyed that this game works different. As an Alien franchise fan i couldn't be more pleased about this game. It is way way higher them others attempts to bring the alien franchise to life. Everything that you want is there, the gore, the psychological terror, the mood of the first film, the tension e man, the thing, the Alien, it really is the ""perfect organism"", i mean, it really is a killing machine and it makes you scared, like i was in the first movie.

I love the way the game goes slow paced, its like a movie actually and you get so immersed that sometimes you forget you are playing a game.

This is a different game for sure and i don't, honestly, recommend it for everyone. It's like a old book, a classic so you should approach it with respect e enter the world instead of being criticising.

For me, it achives what most of games of this genre aren't nowadays. It captures the truly meaning of FEAR in all of it's forms. And to menage that with this franchise alone is a respectful achievement.

I could be here all day talking about every single aspect of the game, but to be short i'd say there is no other title that captures the feel and mood of the first film as this. it's a must play for fans and a great addition to a nearly extinct genre: Survival Horror."
nighthunter,"Mar 16, 2015",8,"Im giving Alien Isolation a good score, its a good game with its atmosphere and gameplay. The only thing that makes no sense its 1 alien stalking you... can pick up guns flame throwers etc and you cant kill it just P it off alot, I know the game is to run but accuracy would have been good too. Overall though a great game but must be in a dark room with good head phones on with emergency service number on speed dial in case of heart attack lol"
peterphnguyen,"Mar 7, 2015",10,"IGN's review of this game actually nearly put me of buying it. But let me warn anyone who is interested to not watch their crappy review, this game as an alien game is amazing. Graphics and sound are amazing, the atmosphere is just perfect. I was never interested in Aliens but since playing this game my interest has soared.
It may seem a bit dragged at certain times but it just means you are getting your moneys worth. The Alien in Isolation definitely portrays the Aliens in the films perfectly and even though you may feel just a little bit op near the end it remains suspenseful hiding and trying to trick your way around Aliens, humans and androids.
Just so you can have an example scenario of what may encounter randomly in this game... I bumped into two humans holding machine guns, one asked me to back away which I did and they let me go. However I had to go past them for some loot in order to create certain items. They saw me and opened fire nearly killing me. But their gunfire attracted the Alien and within 2seconds they were torn to pieces by it which then led to my death as it saw me cowering in the corner of the room.
Love this game."
yestoinfinity,"Mar 5, 2015",8,"voice acting is good and story is engrossing. Alien: Isolation does a really good job of creating a good atmosphere with fantastic visuals and sound design. It's one of the scariest and most stressful games I've ever played. Mostly, this difficulty is well chose but there are quiet a few parts to the game (particularly towards the end) where some of the level design or difficulty feels really poorly designed. It ruins the immersion and really frustrates. It is obviously much less stressful when played on lesser difficulties however, so that could potentially solve that problem.

It's easily a game that I will play again even thought it has a very large campaign. The larger the campaign the better in my opinion. Some it's too long but how is that a drawback?

If there is a sequel (and I hope there is), I'd like to see weapons and tools be more accessible. The tools and weapons mechanics were good, but there were too many cases where the game prevented you from using the weapons which for me was a waste of potential.

Overall though, the aesthetics, level/sound design and long campaign warrant an 8. If the game allowed for more combat or tool utilization, then I would think this game a solid 9. I'd also love a feature where you can explore the colony without the alien being there at all. (at some areas the alien is there at other it's not there) but the option to face off against humans and mechs only would have been really good."
logan_c,"Feb 25, 2015",10,"Wow! What a great game. Beautiful to the core, great stealth gameplay, seeing the alien give you the shivers. deserted on a ship where the people have turn against eachother, androids are going mad, and alien is on the loose. Feels like bioshock but with less wepons and more stealth. none the less. great game."
PrinceofNessus,"Feb 23, 2015",2,"Boring and formulaic. If you aren't unnerved or freaked out by being suspenseful music and a BOO! mechanic you can skip this game. It's like being a **** guy in Texas, you're just in and out of closets till you can get the hell off that station.  For me this isn't survival horror, it's hide and seek."

Twentyand1,"Feb 15, 2015",9,"After reading IGN's review of Alien: Isolation I found my excitement for this game quickly waning. Fast forward a few weeks and I continued to see positive reviews from players flooding in here on Metacritic and also on Reddit. Enough so that the life-long Alien nerd inside me finally won over and convinced me that I must try this game. I am beyond ecstatic that I did. Not only was IGN dead wrong, leading me to new sources for my reviews from now on, but I am also extremely proud to report to fellow Alien fans that this is an experience that belongs right up there with the first two films in the franchise. If you grew up lovig the movies as much as I did then you absolutely owe it to yourself to experience this game.

The graphics and visuals are gorgeous, perfectly capturing the look and feel of the first movie. Despite all the terrifying things occurring around me I could not satisfy my desire to explore this world enough. I felt literally transported into the movies I have loved for so long.

The gameplay takes many of the things you expect to find in good horror games and combines them with very strong stealth elements. You will find yourself scavenging for scarce supplies forcing you to make your shots count and think strategically about each encounter and what to craft to get through it. There are a myriad of tools and weapons you will find and upgrade as you progress, slowly giving you more and more strategic options as you near the end of the game. But enough about all that, lets get on to what separates this game head-and-shoulders above the rest.

The Alien.

The presence of the Alien is what turns this game into a masterpiece of the survival horror genre. Unpredictable, invincible and always hunting you, the Alien makes every encounter feel dynamic and every save point feel like a glorious and hard earned achievement. Ive seen a good many people complain about the Alien's aggressiveness and the lack of automatic **** these elements turn this game into something special, an experience that I have never had in any game before, which is a good thing. With how well executed this game is from start to finish it becomes a great thing. After completion I fully realized how I wouldn't have it any other way and how accutely these elements combine to make it an experience unlike anything else out there. As a gamer I want more experiences that strive to separate themselves from the pack and this one fully delivers.

The only negatives I had revolved around character and backtracking. Some of the characters are a little flat and some of their animations can be a little stilted, but the overall quality of everything else tends to drown these nitpicks out. There are some sections where you will be required to backtrack, enough where I feel it needs to be mentioned. However, that being said, by the time you get to these areas you will have upgraded your tools and found new equipment that will allow you to access new areas all together. So as soon as I began to recognize the area I was in I would soon find myself accessing something brand new making this a minor grip at best.

If you are a fan of survival horror and have been looking for a new experience that drives the genre forward, then look no farther. This game is well worth the investment of your time and money. If you are a die-hard fan of the first two Alien movies then you are simply doing yourself a disservice by not playing this. I cant wait to see what Creative Assembly will do next."

JacklegJack,"Feb 9, 2015",10,"It's been a long time since a game has instilled such a genuine sense of fear and trepidation in me, but playing through Alien Isolation provides those feelings in spades. Creative Assembly have done a phenomenal job recreating not just the sets and physical elements from the original Alien movie, but also the tense atmosphere and edge-of-your-seat thrill the whole way through. This isn't a mindless first person shooter, you need to carefully plan every course of action and always have a Plan B and C prepared. CA has certainly put the ""Intelligence"" back into ""Artificial Intelligence"" as encounters with enemies will rarely turn out as straightforward or simple as you might've hoped going in.

Alien Isolation will completely absorb you right from the start and with strategically placed save points scattered throughout the game you will truly learn to appreciate the value of survival. The visuals are stunning and the Alien is an unpredictable and terrifying monstrosity. My only qualm about the game? No free-roam mode. I would have loved to be able to go back and marvel at the beautifully detailed work that went into the environments. Unfortunately for me I was far too terrified to stand still for more than a moment to do any sight-seeing during the campaign."

JayLightBar,"Feb 9, 2015",8,"The industry used to say horror wasn't a profitable genre....yeah, right. Anyways for the actual review. Alien Isolation is probably the best game I own on the ps4. The game looks great, runs well, all of course is important with it running as smooth as butter. The sound design is probably the best part, really bringing in the same cheesy sci-fi vibe that the original Alien did. I love this game to death, and the length for me anyways was just right. A lot of filler parts, but for me personally I loved all of it. Though the games ending is garbage, noticing that a lot with recent games, but other than that this game was completely worth every penny I dropped for it."
Taggen86,"Feb 7, 2015",10,"One of the best games for ps4 this far. The atmosphere is amazing and captures the film almost perfectly, The gameplay is awesome aswell and you really need to manage your resources on the higher difficulties. Do not listen to the people that tell you that the game is too long or too hard, the game is awesome! Currently on my second playthrough."
Shynmas,"Feb 4, 2015",9,"Wow... This game remembered me the exact reasons why I love SO much the Alien universe (probably the my favourite one all time)!

At start, you could say that graphics are not that impressive.. then you quickly realise that this is exactly the same universe that you felt in love some 20y ago. The visuals of the PCs, the emergency alarms, the creepy but realistic sounds, the monumental structure floating in deep space that you are exploring... and of course this fantastic creature that has never been so well rendered.

This is an epic game! The storyline captures all the best moments of Alien and Aliens. The atmosphere is great, the path-finding  very good and the creature's reactions are so natural.

My only wish is that I would have had to play more with all the toys... but as in many other games, I'm so much thrifty that I ended up the game without having really tested some in real case situation."
allanon04,"Feb 2, 2015",4,"A new stealth game...! This time part of the Alien franchise. I could not wait to play :) The beginning was great - no ammo, I need to build everything, scattered and scarce resources - perfect! Then I saw the BAD ""guy"" - awesome. My hands were sweaty!

Bottom line - Alien Isolation is a poor implementation **** concept!"
pjcritic,"Jan 31, 2015",9,"Alien Isolation es un juego alucinante e imprescindible para los fans de la saga Alien.

sejanus,"Jan 22, 2015",10,"I like Ridley Scotts Alien and have been waiting for a great game adaptation to come along and now its here.yeah so first thing creative assembly did great was the design. They totally recreated the world from the movie  and gave it a retro sci-fi feel makes the experience, authentic. Secondly, they managed to make the alien as  frightening,  and as menacing as it was the first time we encountered it.Thirdly this is  not a FPS shooting gallery, where you can plaster the air vents with acid blood. The alien is almost invincible and if it comes for you , you cant outrun it. Your only option is to hide which creates a lot of **** thing I didnt like was the cliche game objectives(get this keycard to open this door and restore power to this door) and the story is typical tie in canon. none of the characters except Amanda are very interesting. But all in all A great game for fans of the series.I hope they come back with a sequel and give Amanda a pulse rifle."
swotam,"Jan 22, 2015",9,"A great game for fans of the Horror Survival genre and an excellent offering for fans of the Alien universe. Creative Assembly have delivered a top notch game that is incredibly faithful to the look and feel of the original Alien film and right from the start you feel as if you have stepped into the world created by Ridley Scott in 1979.

Despite some sites giving this game less than stellar reviews (IGN), the game itself if solid and appealing. The Alien is merciless, relentless, and terrifying. Survival isn't just a matter of hiding in a closet until it goes away, it's a matter of situational awareness, response times, and threat management.

Personally I loved the game and had no issues with the difficulty level (easily adjustable if things get too tough) or the length. The story was solid, the gameplay enjoyable, and the attention to detail was incredible.

If you've been holding off on this because of a couple of misguided reviewers I'd suggest looking at the overwhelmingly positive reviews from actual players here and elsewhere. Very few who own the game dislike it, so odds are if you pick it up you'll like it too."
Darko84,"Jan 20, 2015",8,"Alien: Isolation is with no doubt the best survival horror game available for next gen consoles as of today.
However I must say this is not a game for everyone, it takes a lot of patience and planning.
The atmosphere and graphics are amazing. The sensation to be in danger all time is just unique (it does not matter if it is humans, synthetics or the Alien).
If you are a survival horror fan, you must play this game.

Positive things:
+ Next gen graphics.
+ Survival horror elements.
+ Crafting and saving system.
+ Alien design is terrific!

Negative things:
- It may became a little bit repetitive/predictable after the second half.
- AI can be improved."

Miuku,"Jan 8, 2015",7,"You don't need to be an Alien fan to play this nice horror game, but if you're familiar with the first movie, then you will definitely notice how the developers have nailed the atmosphere of the first film. Dark hallways with blinking retro computers, and creepy rumble on air vents will keep you at your toes almost all the time.

If you liked games like Amnesia or Outlast, you will be in love with this one. But if you dislike sneaking in video games, then you should pass this one.

Game has a lot of variety. You will be hiding from the Alien. Avoiding androids. Exploring the station. Gun fights with human hostiles. Solving small mini-game like puzzles. Crafting items & equipment, and the list goes on. Also the Alien AI is great!

But why I didn't give this game a higher score, is because of the pacing of the game, when you've completed the first half. And the ending that you'll see after all the struggle, isn't that great. At the final missions you will face a lot of instant death-scenes, which you will only solve by trial and error, it doesn't feel like a challenge. And after the game, you wont unlock any bonuses or new game modes etc. There isn't that much replay variety.

The common complaint  about the game is that the save stations are too far and between, but i greatly disagree. There are plenty of save stations making sure, that when you die, you wont need to start all over again. If player misses these beeping stations, they can only blame themselves.

Over all its a good horror game."
AnimeUnknown,"Dec 30, 2014",10,"Wow. I am blown away. This is a piece of art not just entertainment. This game isn't for everyone, its not perfect and won't hand feed you fun... but it will leave you feeling completely satisfied. I haven't felt this way after finishing a game since Mass Effect 2. Sometimes I was swearing at the screen in frustration, other times I was marveling at the smallest details. This is not for every gamer, but if you value the small details then this will provide it in spades. It won't get game of the year as it doesn't spoon feed entertainment to the masses.... but this is a masterpiece just like the Alien and Aliens movies.

Not perfect.... but I feel so satisfied it still deserves 10/10"
ChaosBreakGamer,"Dec 22, 2014",6,"Alien Isolation, a much anticipated title among all fans of the ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" franchises. Taking a path reminiscent of survival horror games over 2013's disappointment ""Aliens: Colonial Marines"". The story is a very strong part of the game, following Allen Ripley's (Protagonist of all 'Aliens' movies) daughter, Amanda Ripley. Amanda has made it her life's mission to find out what, really, happened to her mother during the events of the movies as she has gotten no word from or about her mother for 20 years. As she and her crew mates get a distress signal from a space station they rush to help as it is discovered that her mother's story may e intertwined with the distress signal from the station. When arriving you are separated from your crew, left to wonder aimlessly through the station's claustrophobic halls and breathtaking environments.

The gameplay is solid and impressive, without many bugs to speak of and controls that keep you engaged through the entire story mode campaign (Approx. 13 hours). The atmosphere of the game is very clear and simplistic, yet, terrifying as you are always aware that the alien is - to some extent - always watching you. This causes you to never feel at ease (even in the air ventilation systems) as the alien has the ability to crawl into those as well, causing you to stay on your toes at all time. The game introduces another type of enemy, a 'Working Joe', which are androids who work for the station and attempt to 'assist' you on your journey; Unfortunately, as you soon find out, you have to sneak past them, causing them to consider you an 'enemy' and attempt to kill you on sight. The game also implements some clever mechanics when it comes to avoiding the alien: use the motion tracker when he is too close and he will hear you, when he is near the locker that you are hiding in you must lean back and hold your breath, and so much more. The atmosphere is also very tense and the art-style is very clear and unique, opting for the retro-futuristic view of the original movies; which in turn, only help in making the games that much more involving and enjoyable.

The story mode is enough to pleasure all fans of the franchise, but that isn't nearly it. The developers have bothered to include some worth-while collectibles such as: ID Tags (Scattered around the stations with the faces of all of the developers on them) as well as, potentially, the most involving audio logs in any game I have ever played which has the original cast of the movies leaving behind audio logs for the distress team (you) to receive in due time.

Some of the game's drawbacks, however, are sourced from the fact that you are facing off against malfunctioning androids as well as the alien (alongside the occasional humans) and sometimes deaths may feel cheap as supplies are scarce and may cause you to restart the game if you feel that you cold have resolved the situation more efficiently. The story also seems to focus a bit to much on the androids rather then the alien, whom the game is titled after, also, it seems as though the story drags on a bit and could have been a few hours shorter as the game is not only punishingly hard but also sequel baits in the end. I know many would argue that a survival horror game should, in fact, be very difficult and slow (The latter, I have no issues with) but the fact that the game seems to not reward you enough seems odd. I have also found many strange annoyances in the game, one of which was when i killed my first human, they had a fully functional hand-gun which (for some reason) I was unable to pick up (Neither the gun nor the ammunition) whereas a few minutes later i got the same gun, which used the same ammunition. which although being a minor annoyance, was seemingly very odd as you would assume that Amanda wishes to survive and therefore pick up the weapon.

Overall I consider this game to be entertaining and very clever in execution as it is very clear that a lot of time and effort being put into it. However the drawbacks of the game seem to, for me personally, bring the game down a bit and harm its final verdict which was meticulously calculated to convey my feelings towards the game.

Before anyone outrages at me for only giving the 'Masterpiece ****"" a mere 6, please consider the following, 5 is an average game which means that a 6 (At least by my standards) is a game that is slightly above average as I have annotated all that i consider good and bad with the game."

STEPHpunisher,"Dec 18, 2014",9,"A sci fi-horror game faithful to its movie counterpart, dripping with creepy atmosphere, constant suspense, and retro-futuristic scenery. This game has all the chest pounding (and bursting) that you could possibly endure. The tension I experienced while playing it for the first time, tiptoeing around and hearing my friend shout ""look out!,"" could never be recreated. Cowering in a locker, climbing into a vent, hearing a save station beep when you're defenseless and you can hear the hiss of the Alien-- these are memories I will never forget. If played on a normal or hard difficulty, Alien: Isolation has the feeling of an old-school game: it doesn't hold your hand, the enemy is truly powerful, and the only way to survive is through quick thinking and luck.

Also, the Xenomorph AI is actually incredible. The Alien will learn your typical mode of escape -- and adapt. A perfect organism indeed."
670Gamer,"Dec 15, 2014",8,"Love hide and seek when you were a kid? I loved it and still play it with my son. This game is well done. The action is not much, but the stealth and suspense/horror I believe makes up for it. Enjoy this and the Evil Within as much as you can cause we probably won't play good horror games like this for a while."
fijiboy,"Dec 8, 2014",8,"alien isolation is a very unique experience and I think that's the best word to use to describe this game, an experience. one of the most immersive games I have ever played, and is genuinely frightening at least for the first half of the game, and then often the challenge of the game over takes the horror sometimes, which is ok because I enjoyed the challenge, but unfortunately there is not enough variation to hold the frightening tension through this surprisingly long game. the thing that this game does best though is that it truly recreates the atmosphere and setting of the first alien movie to perfection. the AI of the alien has been fine tuned to near perfection, but the humans in the game frustrated me a little bit. in the game tips are given during loading screens stating that some people on the ship will leave you alone if you back off, but never have I had a person not try to kill me after they have seen even when I tried walking away from them, so I feel that the people could have had a bit more work done on them. the ending of the game wasn't anything special infact it was a little underwhelming considering how grand and climatic the game had been so far. the characters are pretty well lifeless except for your character Amanda ripley, who ever did her voice acting did a really good job in my opinion, because I felt I was really able to empathize with her fear and other emotions. there is a lot to say about this game but in the end I found that this game is definitely worth playing especially if you are a fan of the alien franchise."
angryw0mb4t,"Dec 4, 2014",5,"Very fun and thrilling for the first hour or so... then quickly devolves into a repetitive stealth game. The good: Fantastic atmosphere, the sounds and design really feel like the original alien movie, the first hour or so of the game has the all-alone and claustrophobic feel of the movie. The bad: once you actually get past the awesome intro and into the meat of the game it's frustrating, there's so much potential, but no story, poorly designed AI (humans repeat what they are saying about every 30 seconds when you are hiding) and nothing that really motivates me to keep playing."
OutDorJustice80,"Dec 2, 2014",9,"First off please disregard the first day reviews if you have any sense of intelligence. The game is well presented in many ways. The atmosphere, sound, intuitive AI just to name a few. In my opinion this is a must buy for an Alien fan or a fan of adventure, horror and sneaking around. I applaud the devs for making a truly amazing IP."
Turbodowg,"Nov 28, 2014",9,"Real Alien fans rejoice! We finally have a game that is worthy of the Alien name. This is one hell of a scary game. The graphics are stunning, the sound is perfect and the mechanics work beautifully. The story line works well and the characters are memorable. Everything has that retro Alien feel from the old school computer screens to the swipe card save points. Alien is tense and using skill and intelligence to outwit the alien and other 'life forms' on the ship makes for some real heart-out-of-your-chest moments.

The level design is imaginative and the game looks so authentic. It feels like the original Alien movie. And the Alien! Oh the Alien! You will **** it every time you come across the super tough super intelligent creature.

This is survival horror at its greatest. Buy it now!

The DLC is also great as it has the original cast and allows you to play through missions from the film. All look realistic and make you feel like you are in the movie."
cstrang,"Nov 27, 2014",5,"Alien: Isolation is a bleakly beautiful game that makes the player feel like prey. It does a great job of presenting a strong survival horror atmosphere by making the player feel constantly under-equipped, overwhelmed, and sometimes out numbered. And, to the game's credit, there are transcendent moments of heart-pounding tension and relief. However, that tension quickly turns to tedium and frustration. The name of the game here is stealth, but there are no mechanics here to help. The first time you get grabbed by your stalker, the xenomorph, it's startling. Maybe even the second and third. By the fourth or fifth, it'll become annoying. It would seem that the perfect hunting machine is a little too perfect, seemingly having ESP or a Lojack chip implanted in your character, so it can sniff you out no matter where you are, how little your moving, or how quiet you're being. Couple this with a ridiculous and archaic checkpointing system, this game is not for those with less-than-saintly patience. The story is flat and degrades to Ripley running errands for her worthless comrades, and the game runs far, far, far too long, probably clocking somewhere between 15 and 20 hours for first-time completion. I'm sure fans of the Alien series will be satisfied if they're willing to put up with the rough patches but for the gamers with no investment in the series to this point, it'll probably be a hard sell to finish."
Lodge1960,"Nov 27, 2014",8,I was a bit premature and hasty with my last revue and so I am submitting another and increasing the score. Initially I stated that the game was too hard but once you get your head around the idea that your character is not a fighter and you persevere with it you will find this to be quite an exciting and atmospheric adventure. It is obvious that a lot of work has gone in to making this game fit in with the look and feel of the original film and it is in fact a lot of fun.
darknesswhale,"Nov 26, 2014",10,"Alien isolation es un juego con un gameplay mas ambientado al sigilo y a la tension, si estas buscando un juego de disparos aquí no lo encontraras, el alien es rápido e impredecible hay una gran variedad de herramientas que sirven de gran ayuda al jugador,es un juego bastante desafiante en altas dificultades, tiene un gran apartado visual y una historia bastante decente es el juego de Aliens que habíamos estado esperando"
Tom360,"Nov 23, 2014",8,"Incredibly bold game. I'm not especially fond of the horror/survival genre but this game is an experience that can't be missed.

It prefectly captures the atmosphere of the first Alien film. At times it can be a slog through sections that demand replay after replay but the presentation of the game more than makes up for it's shortcomings. It gives me hope for other licensed titles due out in the near future."
Rarewarefan64,"Nov 23, 2014",8,"A very solid title, marred by a little bit of technical and third act pacing issues. The graphics and atmosphere are both wonderful with the creepy, nearly abandoned Sevastapol with only usually hostile survivors and the creepy alien lurking most of the time. If the alien does not scare, the working joes are oddities that may freak you out when they spot you, but not the best of substitution for the alien and certainly more vulnerable. The game has atmosphere, but not much in the way of combat. It's somewhat clunky and really not meant for combat. The stealth is a bit better, but the alien latches onto Ripley's ass like a coked up chimpanzee. The clunkiness though cones somewhat from the frame rate which is not terrible, but with any serious action on screen, the frame rate does dip to 25 fps which is not that great. Though, the game's teases the end quite a few times and is the biggest issue and causes the pacing issues of the third act. Overall, with decent but not perfect gameplay and pacing issues, the game makes up that issue with strong atmosphere and sound."
IxianD,"Nov 22, 2014",8,"This game is so pretty, with such a high level of attention to detail and design, that it should win award for graphics alone.  As a game it's not perfect but a lot of fun, creepy and full of jumps and tension and fight or flight moments.  If you loved the original movie you'll be drawn into this game straight away."
Davdak7,"Nov 13, 2014",10,"If you like stealth games, and you like the Alien franchise, GET THIS GAME NOW! For you, this will absolutely be a 10/10 experience. At it's roots, this is a (fantastic) stealth game, and not a survival horror game.

If you're really not into stealth games, you probably wont have as much fun as I had with this."
unluckydice,"Nov 13, 2014",8,"Move over Lara Craft this female protagonist sets the bar high in terms of ace voice acting and flawless willpower, that aside minus the horrible lip sync, character animations and an overblown spectacle in the last few missions Alien Isolation is a step in the right direction with breathless atmospheres, a chilling horrific alien (which i never lost my sense of scariness with even throughout this long game) and a ton of meaningful tools that are required to progress throughout the game. (PS the non autosave function works perfectly with this game, i hope its a new trend in horror games)"
tofusoup,"Nov 12, 2014",8,"This game is fantastic.  It has a few glitches.  Sometimes the AI is wacky, but overall, possibly the best Alien game made so far.  There's enough here for the player to try different things in the setups.  Though the game does drag on near the later half of the game.  I mean how many of these doors and levers do you need to open.  Also the alien does become less of a threat once you get the flame thrower.  Still, despite these few minor annoyances, the game is very good, and amusing."
True_Beleiver,"Nov 12, 2014",7,Finally a Great alien game downright scary at times however the cutscenes were a bit choppy to the point where I was concerned about my hardware if you can overlook that it is a game worth playing
foxviewchannel,"Nov 12, 2014",8,"Finally, the intelligent and merciless killer is back.  Alien: isolation is a survivor horror video game inspired by the first film.

You play as engineer Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Ellen Ripley.  The game is set 15 years after the original Alien.  Amanda is looking for the whereabouts of her mother and she is informed that a flight recorder from the Nostromo space station her mother was on is in another space station called Sevastopol and she accepts to go and retrieve it; however, little did she know that this will end up being her worst nightmare.  The plan doesn’t go as expected, and everyone is separated.

You are now all alone and in the middle of nowhere and right from the beginning the game gives you a sense of isolation.  The pacing of the game slowly builds up until your first encounter with the unforgiving Alien.  From that moment it becomes a game of cat and mouse and the only thing that you will be thinking about is escaping the deadly space station

Encounters with the Alien are unscripted.  It moves dynamically and you will never know when and where it will appear.  You will hear it as it moves through the ventilation and hear its footsteps when it is near you.  The Alien moves slowly and runs when it hears a sound to check where the noise came from.  It will sometimes appear in front of you and your only option is to hide before it is too late.

The Alien's unpredictability is scary.  If you are hiding in a closet for example, you will have to hold your breath when it is near, one wrong move and its game over.  The Alien will evolve slowly and becomes smarter,  if you throw a lot of noise makers, then it will search where the noise came from.

You’re the prey the whole game and your only option is too hide and even though you feel you have to run, you can’t and therefore moving slow is the only option. The game is very tense and there were times were I just wanted to hide and not go out.

Patience is key in this game and you will spend most of your time hiding and crawling.  The tension is built up slowly and you will gradually have access to other items such as the motion tracker which is the game’s most useful item.  The motion detector will beep to notify you when anything is near.

There are other dangers in the space station, androids and hostile humans.  The androids are hard to kill, their vision isn’t very good and are slow,  while the humans aim good so it is better to avoid them.  You will collect various items to craft smoke bombs to noise makers.  Ammo is scare and you will have to make every shot count.  The flame thrower is effective against the Alien to scare it off for a while.  The main campaign took me around 16 hours to finish; however, i felt that some parts do drag a lot.

There are no check points, only save points spread across the station.  The overall story isn’t that interesting but the dark and lifeless atmosphere is just so immersive that you really won’t mind the story. The characters should have been stronger and more charismatic. Instead,  we are left with irrelevant characters that are forgettable.  The station is very detailed but I did find some frame issues during cut scenes.  The PS4 camera has a nice touch as you can move your head around corners and if you make a sound in your room then the Alien will hear you.

This is the Alien as it should be.  Alien Isolation doesn’t have the jump scares; however, what it gives you is a tense experience that is very faithful to the mood of the movies."
krzyspmac,"Nov 10, 2014",10,"Absolutely wonderful in a horrific, scary way :) Didn't have so much fun since ages:D The PS4 controller
works as a sound source for the motion tracker, the music is impeccable and the game itself is quite long. There are some really nice effects. It's one of the few games I'm going to play again :D"
ryancomstock,"Nov 9, 2014",9,"I thought this was a very good game. Some of the negative reviews I've seen seem overly harsh and sometimes include misinformation (you are not done with the alien halfway though the game). In general, I think people need to understand that this is a stealth game requiring patience and caution; if you become reckless in your approach, you will be punished, much like the Souls games. If you're not into stealth, this game is not for you, probably even if you are a big Alien fan. It is also very challenging (I played on hard, so I don't know what the lower difficulties are like, though I'm not sure how much easier the game can be made) so keep that in mind.

In my view, the game nailed the atmosphere and mechanics of dealing with the alien, creating a tense, exhilarating experience. I don't recall another game that made my heart pound so much for such prolonged periods; I felt as though I really was trying to avoid being killed by an unstoppable monster. I found the game extremely immersive. Perhaps if someone is looking for a strictly fun game, this should be avoided until they are in the mood for this type of experience.

All in all, I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging video game set in an immersive, atmospheric world, provided they enjoy stealth. I will likely play through again in the future."
gerardroxburgh,"Nov 5, 2014",9,"Played it on hard. Took approximately 20 hours.

I don't often review anything, but I want to help boost the score of this game. It deserves it. I can't believe the nonsense that IGN and Gamespot spewed. The developers deserve a lot of thanks. They gave a genuine  experience to fans of the saga.

GRAPHICS: 10: Solid lighting, the atmospheric elements only add to the look. Authentic from top to bottom. Might be the best looking game on PS4. Minor details like rack-focusing on the motion tracker are great touches.

SOUND: 10+: As good as it gets. Sound design / surround mix is incredible. Score is solid. Not much else I can say.

GAMEPLAY: 8 The stealth mechanics is fun and the alien being invincible feels fresh. Reminds me of the survival horrors of yesteryear (Resident Evil Nemesis). I’d have liked the ability to climb over boxes and desks/barriers. It feels a little stiff when you have to walk around everything. My other gripe is Amanda’s throwing ability: it’s awful. I know she’s not some seasoned pitcher, but you can barely toss a noise emitter with any sort of accuracy.

LEVEL DESIGN / SET PIECES: 10: Makes you feel like a part of the universe. Constantly ups the ante throughout. Good use of covering the same ground by shifting environmental hazards etc.

STORY: 7 Typical lore, doesn’t expand on much. Feels authentic, but the dialogue from the lead is a little hokey at times. Without spoiling anything, a lot of people complained about the abruptness of the ending, but I thought it was unapologetic and I appreciated it.

(Not a normal criteria for review, but IGN and GAMESPOT complained so much about it)
VALUE: LENGTH / DIFFICULTY: 10: The difficulty made the alien feel dangerous to the very end. It didn’t hold your hand. It’s what a single player experience should be. At this point I haven’t touched upon the other game-modes, but I already got my money’s worth. It never felt repetitive. Once you learn the Alien’s behavioral patterns, it opens up the freedom to explore a bit more. Looking forward to trying the other modes and future DLC.

9/10 - Superb. Creative Assembly made the xenomorph scary again. Hopefully they build upon this franchise with future titles."
Lionite,"Nov 5, 2014",4,"Its not awful but it certainly isn't good. The atmosphere started out as very scary and i was anxious and excited to meet the alien. The graphics are ok, not as good as some next gen but better than ps3. But then i had to use stealth. I like stealth games. But when enemies start to see you and say you make a noise when you were well hidden and standing still is really frustrating. I appreciate the fact that your human ingame and not invincible but you die way too easily. The fact you have to load a past save and cant save anymore is so frustratingly dated that its a wonder it was even used. The game is too unforgiving for little mistakes you make (and dont make) that doing things that took yoh a long time over and over when you get caught by the Alien makes it not very fun at all. I do not reccommend this game."
mosconstein,"Nov 5, 2014",9,"Wonderful.
Whoever loved the movies, will definitely love this game. The atmosphere, the characters, the locations and the tension of being hunted by the xenomorph are perfectly replicated in this piece of art. A must buy for every alien fan. Plus: wonderful graphic and state-of-the-art sound system.
Beware: Not suitable for children with 'mindless-shooting-syndrome'"
sbc72,"Nov 4, 2014",8,"solid game, great sound effects create some very tense moments specially if playing at the hardest level...  lot of nice details from the movie.  if you are a big fan of the movie don't miss this game..."
Blackulakilla,"Nov 4, 2014",10,this is an amazing game play it for **** sake you little **** **** **** i just came after i completed it on ass **** mode all down my trousers time to clean up
babaganush,"Nov 4, 2014",6,"giving it a 6, stuck it out to the 13th or 14th mission, which every trophy it auto gives you for completing a mission, after mission 3 each trophy was considered ""rare"" so lots of people are not sticking the game out so far.

it is a stressful, long winded game that is very difficult when running from the alien, it was good and has been the 1st game in a long time to give me that kind of challenge. otherwise the game is slow and doesnt give those good kind of challenges enough even though i was always glad when i was done being hunted by the alien but that was still the best part.

until they come out with more updates or much bigger expansions or better online stuff, this game is only a rental or worth buying if it ever gets down to 20$ or less. good game but choppy cutscenes like they were unfinished or cant handle their own graphics power. plus the game also crashed a couple of times which would have been bad if i had not saved recently.

a step in a good direction for alien, they just need to add better combat when fighting the alien or androids, speed up the pace because it is really slow when your not around the alien, it goes from crawling to fast sprinting, it doesnt seem like they got a good balance going on. also as i said more multiplayer stuff. so unless i want to torture myself and throw it on hard then there is no replayability for me just yet."
Jellybean15,"Nov 3, 2014",9,"After the huge disappointment that was Aliens: Colonial Marines, fans and critics were begging for an Alien game worthy of the license. SEGA and Creative Assembly responded with Alien: Isolation, a survival horror game meant to capture the magic of the original Alien film. Fortunately for the fans, Isolation succeeds where Colonial Marines failed.

The game centers on Amanda Ripley, Ellen Ripley’s daughter, a Wayland-Yutani employee who is still currently searching for clues to her mother's whereabouts. She’s invited on an expedition to a space station, the Sevastopol, which has recently recovered information to Ellen Ripley’s whereabouts. Amanda and her colleagues arrive to find the station in ruins, all caused by a hostile Alien stalking the Sevastopol’s halls.

The first thing you'll notice in Isolation is the amazing graphics and sound design. Everything in this game is perfectly detailed, from the character models, to the sharp textures, and some of the best lighting you'll ever seen in a video game. The voice acting is well done (even if the lip syncing ****), and the sound design is perfect. The creepy music and sound affects combined with the creepy dark environments make the intense atmosphere truly live up to the name Isolation.

As mentioned earlier, this is a survival horror game, so it was important for the Alien to be done in a terrifying fashion, which is what Isolation gets right. The Alien looks and sounds great. Everything from the way he stomps which causes your controller to vibrate, crawls through the vents, hisses, and drools spit are all done right. The Alien’s presentation is absolutely perfect for a terrifying experience, but the best thing about the Alien is his unique AI. The Alien’s AI is unpredictable and has no set pattern. Whereas other enemies usually move like they're on a set track or route, the Alien goes wherever he feels. This prevents you from knowing what the Alien will do next, so your stealth skills must be sharp. Sure, you can distract him with items you have, but the Alien will learn and adapt to your moves. Use an item too much, and the Alien will catch on, and find you. Pull out a flamethrower, and the Alien will hesitate, until he finds an opening. To top it all off, the Alien can't be killed, but every one of his attacks are instant kills against you. All of these factors combined make Isolation a paranoia inducing experience on every playthrough.

The only real complaint is the Alien’s annoying habit in staying near your area for too long. Even when he as a whole wide open area to explore, the Alien will stay near you, despite not knowing where you are, which means you’ll often wait minutes at a time in certain areas before you can make a move, which can be frustrating.

Despite being the main antagonist, the Alien is not the only hostile thing on the station. Scared survivors litter the station, and will likely shoot you rather than hear you out. They’ll have guns, and you must outmaneuver them or take them down to survive.

The final enemy type are the Working Joes, mannequin like Androids that have become hostile to humans. Unarmed and slow, but durable and strong, they more than make up for their weaknesses and become terrifying in their own right, but they also center on the story’s biggest weak point.

At one point in the story, the Alien takes a backseat and the Working Joes become the primary antagonist in the story. It’s an interesting concept, but it feels more like a misfire, especially since it takes too long for the Alien to take the spotlight again. Also, the suited Working Joes feel incredibly cheap.

In all honesty, I do believe that this game has small problems. Clunky UI, slightly buggy, a dull story with a sequel bait ending, and an okay but underwhelming character (you can see the parallels they were trying to draw with her mother), but I do believe that the game’s problems have been exaggerated greatly.

The backtracking is not nearly as bad as reviewers make you think. You do revisit areas, but there’s always new nooks and crannies to explore with new items and different enemy arrangements to get around. There may not be any auto save feature, but the manual save works fine, and there are only a couple of stations that may be too far from each other. Lastly, the difficulty is way overstated. In a 15 plus hour campaign on hard mode, I only died ten times. This game is not nearly as difficult as everyone says it is. I'm even going as far to say that they're just bad at stealth games in general.

Overall, the game is fantastic. It more than makes up for SEGA’s previous Alien game, and if you’re a hardcore Alien fan, this is the game you've been hoping for. If you're not a fan of horror, are impatient, or don't like stealth focused games, you should probably avoid this title, as you'll either grow impatient or turn bitter after dying so much. Still, this game is absolutely amazing, and an experience I don't regret."
HenriqueV,"Nov 3, 2014",9,"Alien: Isolation is definitely one of the best games of the year. Perhaps the first truly ""survival horror"" ever. If you are a sci-fi lover, then you must play this game. The atmosphere is just amazing. It feels like you are inside a 60's/70's sci-fi movie. The graphics are the best produced for the next-gen at this point.

This is not a game for everyone, tough. If you are used to games like ""Assassin Creed"" or ""Call of Duty"", perhaps you won't enjoy it. That's explain the criticism this game is getting from some press reviews. First of all, its a game where you barely needs to fire a gun. Your best way to survive in this game, is hiding. Sometimes you need to spend some minutes hiding while the Creature walks around looking for you. So, if you are expecting something similar James Cameron's ""Aliens"" you won't find it here.

A:I is a perfect recreation of 1979 classic. Its a nerve wracking experience. The Alien (called the Creature in the game) feels like its is supposed to be: a perfect organism. As I said before, the atmosphere and the graphics are amazing. For sci-fi and Alien fans there are some magical moments (at some points you feel like you are inside 2001 Space Odyssey).

The Creature is unpredictable and is not scripted. The save points are not friendly. The creature cannot be killed. The sound design creates a tense atmosphere (perhaps its one the best gaming sound design ever). Thats the perfect formula for creating a real horror experience in video-games. Its almost impossible to get scared playing a game when you can save your progress any time you want, when your enemies have predictable behavior and when you know if you fire some bullets you will kill then all at some point.

Its not an easy game. My advise: in your first play-trough, choose the ""easy"" difficult, otherwise your experience can be more frustrating than scary. I also believe in ""gamma settings"" you should choose a configuration with more shadows. The game design gets more beautiful with its lights and contrasts, and the sci-fi horror atmosphere gets a little better.

Its also a long game. But it never gets boring. Its not a movie. Its a game, a sci-fi one. There are other issues you have to deal with, the creature is not the only one. It means you need to explore Sevastopol and discover some of its secrets. Its a vey satisfying journey.

Sega and the producers deserve credits for taking risks with this game. I think A:I will follow the same pattern as some sci-fi classics like Blade Runner, 2001, Alien and even Prometheus. Movies who received ""mixed"" reviews when they were released, but got ""classical"" status in the following years. This game will be a classic one day.

I won't give this game a 10, because since its a PS4 game, the characters facial expressions and movements doesn't feel super natural, and sometimes some of them are speaking but their mouths are not moving. Last Of Us raised the bar in that aspect. I also believe that the fighting against the androids should be more dynamic. Other issue I found in the game, was the use of some video-game clichés, like ""the path is blocked, find and alternative reach point x"". Despite those minor flaws, its a solid great game. One of the best of this year so far.

A game changer for sci-fi and survival horror gaming. Worth every penny."
Smilingandroid,"Nov 3, 2014",10,"Absolute gem ****. Yes you die a lot, but if you played the games from the 80s and 90s, you died alot too. The atmosphere in the game is 10/10, the music is incredible, **** you into the game and ramping up the stress at the right time.

This is very close to Dead Space and I enjoyed that game immensely but IMHO, this game surpasses it immeasurably with the atmosphere. I have read opinions of whether this would have worked better as a 3rd person, but I think this is perfect as a first person. You feel completed immersed in the space station.

I am playing this game slowly because it's too stressful to play for more than an hour at a time. Stressful not in bad oh-this-is-a-lousy-game kind of way but, in a this game scares the crap out of me way.

This is easily my top 2 game of the year, the other being The Last of Us Remastered - which wasn't scary in any way but had amazing production value and quality."

cowboyntoronto,"Oct 31, 2014",10,"Alien Isolation is an astounding experience from beginning to end, this game really raises the bar in the horror genre. Absolutely the best alien game to date, and  I would even say that they finally made a game worthy of the franchise! I was blown away with the graphic's, and completely fell in love with our new heroine Ripley! I felt like I was really watching Sigorney's daughter maturate, through out an heart racing ride of sci-fiction terror. The pace of this game is spot on, and my best comparison to game play would be alien's meets outlast. However you will be able to wield makeshift weapons, and there is a fair amount of gathering material to do such. This game won't appeal to everyone, as its not a COD or Battlefield 1st person shooter. Quite the opposite, this game is a breathe of fresh air, and at a time when we have been over saturated with the same type of shooters/and story plots. Be prepared to play this game in the dark, I recommend surround sound or a very good pair of headphones. No distractions, and go into this game knowing this game requires a lot of stealth and patience! Not much to complain about in this game, anything its lacking most likely would have taken away from the suspenseful pleasure of being stalked by a super smart and always moving ALIEN! So charge up your controller, bust out the beer/soda and enjoy the ride."
BigBiggo,"Oct 30, 2014",10,"Think Doom 3 with a lot less shooting. The alien is big and scary but the androids are significantly more disturbing, in my opinion anyway. The A.I patterns of the alien are randomised (like in the STALKER games) but there are some occasional scripted sequences for dramatic effect. Lots of nods to the original film and a few to a Blade Runner even! The cutscenes look weird and stutter and most of the facial animation is quite unconvincing but these are trivial issues. It is a very linear corridor shooter type of deal and there are aspects which are quite stupid (no jump button etc) so it is not a game without its quirks. This game is highly immersive and memorable and these traits are what really count in a game. If you are an avid fan of good things then you should definitely check this out."
kev709,"Oct 30, 2014",3,"You fight working Joes, that's most of the game. On the odd occasion the Alien is in the game a quick blast from the flamethrower sends it running once you receive several missions in. Im a huge fan of the Alien franchise and this left a bitter taste in my mouth. Since when did the Alien ever walk around hallways randomly on its hind legs? Since when were working Joes the main enemy you fight? The controls are awkward too, having to hold multiple buttons at a time to do even the most basic commands"
jstanothergamr,"Oct 29, 2014",9,"9.5 - one of the first times I've cheered at the end ****

Because I felt like I had just been through a grand experience.  The game achieves the nuance of the 1979 and then brings a scope and intensity that can't be achieved in film.  I've noticed a lot of complaints about the second half of the game and I completely disagree.  I can only explain it like this: the first half is 1979 ""Alien"" and the second half is if Ridley Scott had returned to do a sequel.  The gaming experience opens up and you go places and see things you didn't expect.. then sheer terror ensues.

The graphics and sound design are of course top notch.  Everything is perfectly recreated and the atmosphere is thick (something missing from a lot of games these days).  If you've ever had a chance to play Penumbra, Amnesia, or Outlast then you'll understand.

The campaign is relatively 20 hrs (definitely play it on Hard) and the Survivor mode is a great touch.  If you want to have close up and fast encounters with the Alien then that extra mode definitely adds to your dollar value.

The only reason I can't give this game a 10 is because the ps4 version has significant frame stutter issues with the cutscenes (hopefully this will be fixed in a patch) and there are a few audio glitches in corners of the map.  Other than those two things, this is a game worth your money and time.

Creative Assembly did amazing work on this one and crafted the best Alien experience to date. And yes, I'm saying it's better than the James Cameron inspired AVP2... way better."
PEdiPRANTA,"Oct 29, 2014",9,"This is is a game that is not for everyone.
It's a really slow paced game with a old fashioned save system that may upset the most impatient persons.
With that said, I have to say that I loved this game and I think it's a really masterpiece.
The Alien is the most intelligent enemy I found in a game ever. It's tense and intense.
I was decided not to buy this game after I saw the IGN review, but after some days, I decided to see it for myself, and thanks god I did this. It's the most fun I had in a game this year, by far!
Like I said in the beginning, I know this game is not for everyone and for sure this is not the king of game for the guy who made the IGN review.  But I thought their review was too irresponsible. The fact that I didn't like one game shouldn't be the motive to give it a very low score. It may not be my kind of game, but this doesn't mean the game is bad, for god sake!
The graphics are fantastic, the enemy AI is the best I ever experienced, the light is amazing! And the **** my god!!!
One piece of advice. Try this game for yourself. Borrow it from a friend or rent it. You may don't like it, but if this is your kind of game, I guarantee you will love it.
One more thing. I'm just a gamer. I don't work and even don't know somebody who works in the game industry. I just loved this game and. I'm looking forward for a sequel. Please, just do it!"
nezzko,"Oct 28, 2014",9,"Brilliantly stress-inducing as a horror game and spot-on as a licensed game, Alien Isolation delivers a near-perfect take on the xenomorph and its frightening power."
raypeterson2424,"Oct 28, 2014",9,"Want to give the game an 8.5 but can't so rounded up to 9.  Completed the game and spent some time with the time trial missions.  Enjoyed the story and the atmosphere.  Graphics and attention to detail were pretty good.  There was some frame rate issues with some of the cut scenes and a a few action sequences but not enough to ruin the mood.
The alien AI is good but not great.  Sometimes it can't see me as we circle a tool cart and other times it is quick to find you if you make your presence known.  The tool building/weapon selection wheel is ok, but can be a pain if you need to switch to something else quickly while in battle.  Voice work is well done and Sigourney Weaver sounds pretty similar to 1980's self.
If you're an Alien fan that likes stealth and tactics games then there is a chance you'll enjoy this.  This game is not for everyone, and could've been a couple hours shorter without a few extra missions thrown in for padding.  For those who don't finish the game you're missing out on some of the better plot lines and levels.  Its at least worth a rental for those who are curious."
Heater,"Oct 28, 2014",7,"Prepare to be a little scared and sneaking around most of the game. Remember that in the movies the people who survived moved in the shadows and kept quiet. In this aspect of the gameplay it actually feels very much like you would expect. The sounds, environments, and support characters' dialog all lend to the feeling that one wrong move will put you in deep trouble real fast. Quick thinking and a being aware of the hiding places around you will get you out of tight spots but save often and approach each area with caution and you'll do fine.

Sadly the game gets very repetitive after a few hours of sneaking around the station. The AI is not exactly predictable when it comes to where enemies will wander but if you sit still long enough you'll find the openings you need in tough spots. And believe me you will be sitting still a lot trying to wait out enemies you can't kill. This does give you a feeling that you're up against something you just can't beat but that's what Alien is all about, overcoming impossible odds to survive long enough to be rescued.

One of the things that actually intrigued me about this game was the way they tied the story into the Alien universe. If you take some time to listen to the recordings, read the emails, and catch on to the dialog you'll notice pieces of the movies shining through. Not only that but for those who didn't catch on during the movies you'll start to better understand the nature of the xenomorphs. Although this did tend to get me more immersed in the game, already knowing what happens to Ellen Ripley made me feel like the main character's objective to figure out what went wrong and what happened to her mother was somehow irrelevant.

If I choose a rating based on how much I enjoy a game combined with how long it takes to finish and how replayable it is, I'd have to rate this below average. The gameplay gets so repetitive that I was glad when the game ended even though it only took about half the time that I was expecting from a survival horror game. I didn't like hiding so much but it made finding ways around enemies fun once you had devices to distract them or secret places to hide. Sadly the replay value doesn't seem to be there because the objectives were too linear to hope for any variance from my first playthrough. That being said, if you're a fan of Alien this game is a must play and you will have some fun leading Amanda down memory lane."
seil3949,"Oct 27, 2014",9,"Alien Isolation es una experiencia cinemática en primera persona, se juega y se siente como una película más de Alien, ambientada en el microcosmos que Ridley Scott creo con la Nostromo, en la primera película de Alien. El gameplay es fluido, con mecánicas de sigilo, y el uso de herramientas que faciliten la infiltración y el recorrido sin ser descubiertos por la amenaza continua e impredecible del Alien. El Xenomorfo posee una Inteligencia Artifical muy por encima de las expectativas, su comportamiento suele ser impredecible y es una verdadera fuente de tensión durante todo el juego. Alien Isolation no es un Shooter, es decir, tienes un Revolver y una Escopeta pero puedes pasar más del 90% del juego sin utilizarlos. Muy buen juego, le doy 9."
Zyglroxenon,"Oct 27, 2014",7,"This game is a prime example of a very good game that is simply bloated and loses some of its appeal after a while. The first several hours (5-6) are very entertaining. You are playing hide and seek with the alien, and whenever he shows up, your heart will jump in your throat. It will be a tense experience. Unfortunately, this is the whole mechanic the game is based on, and the fact that they expanded it into approximately 15 hours of gameplay, is kind of silly. The game just started to drag, and I lost the sense of tension, and the sense of suspense, as it gave way to frustration and tedium. There are a lot of instant death situations that you will be put into that are, well, nearly unavoidable. The game is challenging, yeah, and I like challenging games, but not this kind of challenging, this is the trial-and-error kind of challenging. The encounters with the androids are kind of daft too, as the game isn't really built to be a first person shooter but they needed to add some variety into a long game of hide and seek.

However, the game's presentation is fantastic. It really nails the vibe of the first Alien movie as the art direction, sound design, and lighting are spot on. Overall, it is a great game, but it's a chore to finish it. If they have another bash at this, I really hope they get the pacing right next time."
Ed_Kel,"Oct 27, 2014",9,"Having played Alien: Isolation for awhile now, I can say with complete confidence that this the best Alien game to date and one of the best next-gen  releases so far this year. The level design is pristine and makes you feel as if you're actually in the 1970's - 80's Alien films. The Xenomorph is equally well designed and truly terrifying. Since the majority of its movement is randomized, you never know when he'll show up and how to deal with / track his movements. It's truly unnerving. Whats more, it can be a lot of fun to use it to your advantage as well. There's nothing like approaching a group of humans, popping one with the revolver, waiting for the Xenomorph to investigate, and allowing it to annihilate your enemies for you. That is of course, if it doesn't annihilate you as well. The Working Joes (androids) can be equally as horrifying as well. Without knowing what to look for, you never know if it will be friendly or hostile and if it decides to be hostile it can be just as frustrating, albeit rewarding, to get away from them as it is the alien. To the credit of the lower scoring reviewers out there, it can get frustrating having to replay certain levels time and time again until you get your movements just right. It can be even more frustrating to think you're hiding safely away in a locker only for the Xenomorph to find you, or that you're killed just before you reach the ""holy grail"" - save point but I think this works in favor of the game. It's extremely rewarding when you do reach those save points and it's intriguing enough to keep you pressing through. When you  see people scoring this game low because it's ""frustratingly difficult"" rest assured that these people were not the individuals the developers were targeting -- it isn't for everybody. But if you're looking for a truly terrifying survival horror that will keep you on your toes and rewards patience over belligerence, then Alien: Isolation is definitely worth your time."
Folstar,"Oct 26, 2014",0,"Are these other reviews jokes or getting paid? This game is a boring, walking around pushing buttons and turning levers then occasionally encountering a poorly rendered Alien that has severely impaired vision. Strip away the pretty graphics and this game is just pushing a series of buttons to outfox laughably bad AI. The alien isn't scary or immersive or anything good."
Notonlytheend,"Oct 25, 2014",7,"Suspenseful but not truly scary. There's a good deal of trial and error in attempts to stay alive. I started on hard, which was a mistake unless you enjoy reloading every 4 minutes. Isolation is fun on lower levels, but again, you're still going to end up reloading a bit. It's not because it's too hard, but because luck is a factor later in the game. If you're a big suspense and stealth game fan or if you can't get enough of the Alien universe, you should definitely grab this game. All and all, it fits better with the universe than anything else with an Alien title after Aliens."
googegamer,"Oct 24, 2014",9,"I loved this game! I am not a huge fan of horror/thriller games, mainly trying for my love of stealth.
The music and scenes were simply amazing, the developers definitely hit the spot when trying to capture the essence of the first film. The corridors are dim, the computers reminiscent of the 70's view of the future and the fog and smoke finish of the unnerving atmosphere. Cue the alien.

All the elements combined make you think you are the first Ripley running around the Nostromo.

Although some may argue that the unpredictable AI is annoying and the Alien is not true to the original Xenomorph, it is one of those arguments of pure opinion.

While the AI can be annoying, there are many tools to use to make sure you can keep an eye on where it's at. Like listening to it in the vents above you, using your motion tracker and then the age old trick of keeping it in sight from afar. Another area of conjecture is how loud the alien is when it walks. Put it this way, if it wasn't loud you would die a hell of a lot more.
Also, I love the way you can't run, it adds so much more suspense to any level. You have no option but to crawl, excruciatingly slowly, through the corridors, unsure of when the alien will jump out next, but sure that if you run, you are as good as gone. I will admit that is it slightly repetitive, but when the suspense never lets up you really don't even realise.

The only point lost was for the shocking save system, although it too adds to the suspense, it is impractical for a game like this, where you will most likely die 20 odd times throughout any single level."
FreeSnaks,"Oct 24, 2014",8,"-Atmosphere is fantastic
-Packed with tense moments full of stressful delight
-At times can be quite unforgiving (Pro and a Con)

djwille88,"Oct 23, 2014",9,"When I play games I'm often looking for games that offer me an experience and bring forth that ""wow, I can't playing this game"",  feeling.  It doesn't happen often but games that did bring this out were game's like Killzone 2 mp, TLOU, Demon's ****.

I'm going to cut to the chase here...Alien Isolation is hands down the best game I've played this year.  I've never  before had a game bring out the terror and tension that Isolation has.  It's a slow paced, methodical game, and it's not going to everyone's cup of tea though.  Sound, lighting, graphics, and Alien is top notch.  They only real negatives I have with the game are minor, the NPC lip syncing stinks and the framerate on a few of the cutscene's seriously chugs along.

If you're any kind fan of the Alien franchise this game is a must buy!"
mjv3585,"Oct 23, 2014",10,"With the sting of Colonial Marines still fresh in my mind, I approached this game with cautious optimism. Happily though, it has turned out to be a marvelous game that has truly captured the genius of Ridley Scott's initial movie.

If you love the first and second alien movies, this game will be a rewarding and artfully crafted universe that is as dark as it is beautiful. The game manages to pay homage to the source material in so many ways while also building in its own nuances.

If you think of this game as a stealth game, you would be mostly right. Instead, it might be best to think of it as a survival simulator. This is no exaggeration. The level of difficulty in avoiding the alien is matched by the feeling of relief when you manage to escape to a new area.

If you play nothing but fast action paced games where you have 10 guns and a sense of invulnerability, do not pick of this game --  its not for you. This is a game for people who want to be terrified, want to have a true challenge, and most of all -- love the alien universe."
Percussius,"Oct 23, 2014",9,"True Survival Horror is back. I cannot stress enough how much of a breath of fresh air this game is. After being so disappointed with Resident Evil 6 I was very much looking forward to both Alien Isolation and The Evil Within. Both games have delivered on their promises in my opinion but Alien Isolation stands out as what I feel is the first true ""next-gen"" survival horror experience.

Survival horror franchises have devolved in the last few years to being more akin to an action movie than their roots as slow-burn high tension horror experiences. Resident Evil in particular has changed from a game about surviving what seem like insurmountable odds to putting you in control of a player who is basically the unstoppable hero of a Hollywood sci-fi action blockbuster. Where Alien Isolation's brilliance shines through is in just how much emphasis the developers put on the ""survival"" aspect of survival horror. For the majority of the game, when you are seen by the titular Alien it equates to instant death. Even after acquiring the flamethrower later in the game you are only given a few seconds of respite before the Alien returns to hunt you. The gameplay consists of a cat-and-mouse scenario by which you are constantly avoiding confrontation with the Alien and human looters trapped on the Sevastopol space station. The sound design and lighting contribute to a feeling of tension and, well, isolation that are unlike anything I've ever experienced in a game before. The human and android enemies that are still populating the station are hostile but the game gives you plenty of creative ways to use them to your advantage to distract the Alien and progress to the next area. One of my favorite moments in gaming in recent years has been the joint sensation of maniacal joy and terror as I threw a noisemaker into a group of looters and watched from a locker as the Alien ripped open their chest cavities and chased the remaining looter down a hallway only to later hear his cries for help and screams of terror. It's macabre, but ultimately the game is about putting your survival before anyone else's.

Speaking of the lighting and sound design, the A/V aspects of this game are beautiful. I've played it on PS4 and seen the footage of it running on a high-end PC and the current-gen consoles do the game a lot of justice. My one gripe with the performance of the game is that during the cinematic sequences there's a lot of frame rate dipping which causes the video to look staggered and the audio to not quite sync up with the lip movements.however that being said, this may be an issue with just the console version of the game. Other than that, the game pays a loving tribute to one of the greatest sci-fi/horror films of all time. Costumes, lighting, smoke/fog, environments, even the ""future"" MS-DOS looking computer terminals have all been created by an attentive reference to the source material.

This game is built towards a very specific kind of gamer and if you respect and master the mechanics you will be rewarded with one of the greatest experiences of any console generation. Helpful tip: don't be afraid to use your motion tracker."
Jack300,"Oct 23, 2014",10,"This is a fantastic game that Alien fans have been waiting for. Creative Assembly have done a brilliant job in reviving Alien franchise and I really do hope they create a sequel in the future.

Pros -

. Scary atmosphere, the brilliantly crafted Sevastopol Station creates a tense experience throughout the lengthy story.
. The sound design is also great, the soundtrack really makes you feel like this game was influenced by the 1979 Alien movie.
. Alien AI is completely non scripted which makes for some extremely tense moments.

Cons -
. The cut-scenes seem to lag quite a lot and the lip syncing is very bad.
. Using the map pauses the game and breaks immersion (minor con).
. The survival mode, while great, is largely locked behind a pay wall."
DATAcrusher,"Oct 22, 2014",10,"Returning to the roots of Survival Horror, the games starts with an eerie cinematic setting, and turns from bad to worse in the best possible way. Limited and randomized resources means using devices and bullets are hard decisions, as you can quickly run dry.
The alien runs around as it pleases, so loading a savegame after memorizing its pattern means piss in the wind.
When playing on the hardest difficulty, as recommended by the developers, the Alien is truly terrifying: And like many horror games, it is the sound that makes the atmosphere, and this game 'gets' it.
The story will take you in, albeit being slow at times, and feels like its a lost part of the ""Alien"" movie series.
The game has minor bugs here and there, but none which hurt gameplay.
The only negative part is the laggy cutscenes."

MrFlankster,"Oct 21, 2014",10,"Thank you Sega and all those involved in making this game. If you loved the first 2 movies, especially the first then this game is a must play. This game is a true ""survival horror"" in the fullest sense of the term. This game truly is unlike any other game out there. If you buy it and go into it knowing that it requires a lot of patience and thought, and that its not a ""action"" game, then I think you'll enjoy it a great deal.

I did myself a favor and took the advice of a post on IGN and I watched the 1st film before playing it. I even watched the 2nd. That got me all primed to play this game. There are some technical bugs, but I'm giving this the 100% rating based off of how much I enjoyed the game. It has story, gameplay, and probably the best atmosphere that I've ever seen. I really hope they find a way to create a sequel and enhance gameplay features. (Like jumping over obstacles; it's pretty silly that there is an item behind a counter that anyone can hop over, but the game requires a keycard to the door accessing behind said counter.) I spent 30 hours in this game. It has a Metroid type feel to it, making the backtracking worth it. Not once did I feel like I was unnecessarily repeating a level. The dialogue and messages you can find scattered throughout the game really add to the experience, giving you a sense of a community going crazy.

All in all, if you like the movies and want a true survival horror feeling, there isn't another game out there that embodies what it would feel like being trapped in a relatively small habitat with man killing demon while trying to battle the elements, threats, and people trying to do the same as you... survive."

Thanks Guys!!!"
Jimmytwotimes,"Oct 20, 2014",9,"Alien isolation is a masterful experience . One that won't be forgotten if you play it properly .

I am an older gamer . Now I don't mean to bore you with I walked 2 miles in snow type of stories . Video games were way harder in those days . Now most games take the player by the hand these days . Alien Isolation is a hard game . It's very clear from the start this is this is an homage to Mr . Scott's films . As well as Mr. Cameron's . Albeit in a more covert manner . It is also a love letter . Not only to alien fans but also to those of survival horror as well .

The story is pretty good . It's obvious where this game draws its inspiration . I personally love when a devoloper embraces the source material . Yet refuses to compromise its vision . The game has a very clean minimal interface . Allowing for a more cinematic presentation and feel . This game is an homage to the alien film and is essentially a companion piece . As such I would recommend watching the film before playing the game . If only to give you a better appreciation and understanding of the universe you are going to be playing in .

This is a very old school game . It took years to develop the developers took their time. As such they want you to take your time with it . Play it on hard and in the correct manner and you are in for experience . Alien is very old school . Checkpoints ?. Nope extremely rare . Manual save points are spread throughout the game in the form of phones . Ratcheting up the anxiety you are not safe anywhere even while saving . Which brings me to the AI. Of the alien itself .

Throw everything out the window and take the conventions learned from other games and forget them . They will not help you here . Think you can sit in a corner and figure out patrol routes nope the alien will find you . Think you can run away ?. Guess again the alien is an amazing athlete . Covering 40 yards quicker than megatron . Think you could hide in that locker ?. Well if you're in there too long the alien will find you . This is not the only danger on this station . There are several human bandits aboard the ship as well as working joe androids . This is a stealth game and combat is to be avoided . This is a stealth game after all . Making noise is almost always a bad idea . Do not run that's the best advice I can give .

The art design and sound design of this game are stellar . The game is best played in the dark with a good set of cans . The alien is not the only threat aboard this ship . Usually you can tell where the alien is by sound . However all that goes out the window as some objectives sound alarms which will surely attract your new friend . It's in moments like these isolation shines brighter . As the alarms rage and smoke and fog fill your vision you will need to think quick to survive .

Alien isolation is an uncompromising vision . This is the best alien game ever made and definitely one of the finest most unique survival horror titles ever . If played properly you are in for a real treat . Now obviously this game won't appeal to everyone but those aching for a truly different game pick this up . Play the game on hard and you are in for a compelling and rewarding experience you won't soon forget . It'll leave you frazzled and shaking in your little space boots ."

The entire game is based around the last 40mins of the 1st film, which is the most boring imo. Where is the plot?

I enjoyed the AVP games, Aliens 3 (game) was alright but my favorite was Aliens Trilogy. Although looking at ALIENS in games I'd say the best ones aren't actually ALIEN based game. Super Contra and Metroid were my favorite games of all time and I knew the reason why was because there were hints of H.R. Giger's work in there. Then there was.... ugh Aliens Colonial Marines and I wept for my franchise as we might not see another game based on the lore for awhile. The chance to have a good gaming company do a new age ALIEN game had been blown on crappy FPS Call of Duty Alien Warfare. A game that had no sense of the sci-fi horror I knew and loved.

But then we got Alien Isolation... thank you. This is the ALIEN game I've been waiting for. It's beautiful and does the franchise proud. The intro alone made me nerd out pretty hard, hearing Ripley's audio recording from ALIEN as the intro?! I don't care if they threw in ""oh and Ripley had a daughter this whole time...."" storyline. They make it work, and I see a lot of Ripley in her.

As for the actual gameplay, now this is going to be different each fan. I am a big fan of ALIEN the first movie. It had more horror themed elements to it and as the series went along it became more action. Not a bad thing but I just liked how they did the first movie, with such a isolated experience with the Xenomorphs Ripley had nothing else to rely on but herself. I remember the first I watched it, saw a Xenomorph (Kane's son for all you hardcore fans out there) for the first time and man it scared the crap out of me.

This is where the game seemed to draw the most influence from because Alien Isolation is not only a great sci-fi game and a nod to the ALIEN franchise but it's one of the scariest games I've played. Tension, atmosphere, sound and the environment are just downright awesome. Usually modern horror games these days seem to be nothing more than a fest of jumpscares. They are cheap thrills that only lost for a few seconds. Real fear is much worse, its what drive you mad. It's the reason you slow down while playing. It's the reason you're afraid to go forward. The reason you're looking around you in all directions. A jumpscare will cause your hear rate to flutter and you'll go ""ahhh"" then it's gone. Real fear has you talking, saying to yourself everything will be okay. Real fear stays with even after you turn off your game. And this game does that with ease. Lately I haven't been scared by many games or movies. I'm not saying I never get scared but it's hard to get me. Yet somehow with this game I feel fear, and I love every second of it.

I highly recommend this."
Tgooding01,"Oct 17, 2014",7,"This game does some things very well and others... not so well.

I'll begin with the positives. The graphics & atmosphere are amazing. With regards to creating a place that you could believe was real this is up there with Bioshock. The problem is the Alien.

While at first it creates tense moments it soon becomes more of a pain. For something that is meant to be roaming a massive space when its on you, its on you like glue. It can disappear through a door at the end of the corridor then fall from the ceiling right above you. You can ride trains to new locations for it to be there ready to kill you on arrival.Fair enough its an alien and how do I know how it would behave but its almost like you're a dog on a lead and its never far away from you.

You will die a LOT. While fun at the start as you curse yourself for walking under than ceiling vent without thinking it might be there after the 10th time you'll be annoyed, After the 50th you'll be ready to give up. At this point its not scary, its annoying.

To give them credit they tried something new and brave here and they almost pulled it off, I'm not sure how things could be fixed, its almost like they came up with a good idea without the knowledge of how it would actually work."
J4MESOX4D,"Oct 16, 2014",9,"Alien Isolation is one of the most terrifying, gripping and exciting survival horror experiences out there. The fact this scored 5.9 on IGN and was reviewed in the fashion it was; it is an absolute disgrace. Thankfully many people have gone against this and thoroughly enjoyed what is a truly memorable and challenging experience.

Ryan of IGN; a self-confessed Halo fanboy who enjoys primarily simple and generic shooters didn't enjoy this game because he couldn't accept it wasn't a fast paced, action-rife FPS title with guns galore and enemies aplenty. He couldn't understand the concept of the game and how to play it and the review aside from the score showed this. This is a challenging game which demands patience, stealth and timing - it's not some run of the mill FPS and Ryan simply could not understand this.

You play Amanda Ripley who's job is to retrieve a black box from the Sevastapol space station. Sounds simple? Wrong! Upon arrival, it is clear that there is some strange goings-on at the staggeringly beautiful station which propels a simple narrative into a gripping story where survival is all that matters. The pacing of the game is brilliant as the tension and atmosphere become unbearable. You never know what is going to happen next. Most of the game will see you battling against a unknown specie which is prime instigator for the havoc you discover. You must do all you can to survive its clutches with only a few tools and the environment to hide. You're not alone though - there are plenty of characters to meet on the way which develop the narrative and other enemies who you can use as bait against the Alien to help progress. You can access a few weapons but how you use them and when can determine if you survive or don't. Save points are also manual and scattered around the ship which adds to the unbearable horror and makes you play very carefully and cautiously. It's just a remarkable horror title designed in a very clever manner that ticks all the boxes. No game has achieved this level of tension since the early Resident Evil games.

Overall, Isolation is a fantastic title that redefines the horror genre. It's incredibly hard at times but feels very rewarding just to get to the next room unscathed. The visuals are stunning, the atmosphere is horrifying thanks to some epic audio and the lasting challenge makes it a must buy title. If you are expecting a simple, linear fps title with lots of guns, enemies, action and a short but sweet campaign; this game is not for you. If you enjoy horror games or sci-fi; this is a must buy."
gizmofix,"Oct 16, 2014",10,"This game is all about hiding, patience and feeling helpless. This is true horror at it's best, and people who complain about Alien: Isolation being to hard and slow paced, look at the genre again. The game has that perfect original Alien feeling that is a true must-have for all Alien-fans. Some have complained that the game is to hard at Normal. I played it with difficulty set to Hard, and I never had problems playing it. The feeling of always being helpless and not being able to feel secure actually makes the game even better. The inventory and amount of items you can find is perfectly balanced through the whole game. The game has its flaws, such as being a bit repeating in the end, since it turns out it is a very long game. But I can't call it a negative thing. If I would point out on thing though, it is that the horror is somewhat lost in the last few hours. The developers have really put their hearts in this product and I really hope we will see sequel. Because this is survival horror at it's best and also one of the best games of the year. It is like the AAA-version of Outlast, with a fantastic retro-feeling and without Outlasts lack of variation. A survival horror-gamer shouldn't miss this."
mattpl89,"Oct 16, 2014",10,"I never do reviews, but I feel this game deserves one. The people giving this negative reviews don't understand the game. The climate of the game is outstanding. When I play in the dark with headphones game is even better and scary. Great connect of movement detector and dualshock 4. Really realistic felll like you  actually hold it in your hands."
Deschain89,"Oct 15, 2014",7,"With excellent voice acting, an eerie atmosphere, and a masterful soundtrack; this game finally does good service to the first iteration of the Alien franchise. This game is what Alien 3 should have been.

Outlast is tense, you have to hide from the enemies since there is little you can do... wait, I lost my train of thought for a second: Amnesia: the Dark Descent is a powerful game in which you will feel overpowered while you try and find some fuel for your light source... Again, I apologize, it seems these games are terribly identical to the source matter.

On the other hand, it would be preposterous to give this game a bad score, since it is a functional piece of software that will satisfy those who desperately crave a survival horror experience. But truth of the matter is, we have already seen many a game with the same premise, same gameplay, and this falls short because of it.

Was this not a blatant copy of the whole Amnesia: Dark Hide and Seek, was this game to come five years ago, it would have blown everyone's mind, twice, possibly three times. Nowadays, it is a good experience, a deserving game for the franchise, but nothing else.

Besides, once you learn the simplistic AI can't do anything but run around in circles doing the same interactions over and over, you will grow past this game, feel bored by the premise, and never touch it again. You have weapons, but on the hardest difficulty, which is the recommended setting, you might as well not have them, since you will waste all your ammo on an android, only to have a couple more come and join the fight, and the alien is invulnerable to everything. You can craft items, but this feature is far from enjoyable, it feels more of a chore; just give me a chaff grenade instead of making me collect 3 stupid sensors, go to the crafting menu, select all solitary components, and then create the improvised grenade. Pointless features, the fighting and crafting in this game.

Don't let the nitpicking discourage you from playing this game, for at it's core, it is a good game, with a nicely acted story, deserving of at least one playthrough, just borrow it in a week from one of your wealthy friends, they will surely be bored of it by then, and give it a go."
neilrieck,"Oct 15, 2014",8,"This game is best played with the lights off but it will scare the crap out of you! (I used store credit after returning Destiny to make this purchase; what a welcome suprise). Warning: This is a survival game and you need to use your wits. For example, I wasted a bunch of time getting around a fire only to realize that you log into a nearby computer to kill the flow of gas to that section. ﻿"
partyintheback,"Oct 15, 2014",10,"Easily the best Alien game ever created. Attention to detail, stealth gameplay, and A.I. is top notch in this game. You must buy this one. Creative Assembly and Sega created something special with Alien Isolation."
hemmo1986,"Oct 15, 2014",7,"Alien: Isolation is at heart the closest recreation of Ridley Scotts original Alien movie. The atmosphere is just amazing, the Alien,truly frightening. The look and feel and the amount of detail that has been achieved in this game,pays true homage to the Alien universe.

Where Alien:Isolation stumbles is in its repetitive game-play and at times truly frustrating design. Where the Alien is at first truly terrifying,over time it becomes more of an annoyance and becomes a relief when its not around, simply because when its not around it means you wont die and have to repeat what just took you thirty minutes to achieve, simply due to the lack of save points.

Alien:Isolation is almost the Alien game we all have been waiting for.......almost."
VitaGamer12,"Oct 15, 2014",8,This game is great and truly gives the scares. The ai is so good and is done randomly. The game is pretty hard too. The voice acting is average at best and the cutscenes are just meh. The gameplay is great though. Creative Assembly have really done a great job.
hydaway1,"Oct 14, 2014",9,"I'm so glad this game is not another Colonial Marines! This is what happens when a game is put into a competent developers hands! Alien Isolation is a Superb game, and you should play it!

You play as engineer Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley from the first and second Alien film. Amanda has been searching for Ellen, and is informed of a lead on the space station Sevastopol. As usual in a horror story things go horribly wrong. It's awesome. Alien Isolation plays like a stealth game, well a cat and mouse game, and you're the mouse. Your enemies are significantly stronger than you, especially the Alien. So it's usually in your best interest to crouch walk through the deserted and dead hallways to your next objective. That's not to say you can't fight back, the game gives you an arsenal, but if still makes you feel weak and vulnerable. You have that gun? Ok, it's gonna take a few shots to put that enemy down, oh, and the Alien will hear you! Oh, you have that flamethrower that scares the Alien away? Well, he will come back, and he will be pissed! Alien Isolation is terrifying because of this constant one-move-from-checkmate feeling, and it's excellent atmosphere further drives this feeling. Walking down a deserted hallway and hearing the Alien bump around in the vents is heart pounding! Your only source of comfort is your motion tracker, which alerts you to near by enemies. But you dread pulling out your only savior because you don't want the Alien to be near you, and you don't want to confirm that it's near you. Ignorance is bliss, unless you're standing in the fire (speaking from experience here.) This is all topped of with a manual save system, which also acts as your checkpoint system. I liked this, and thankfully the save stations are evenly spaced out. So you won't have to repeat too much if your die. Gameplay wise Alien Isolation exceeds with flying colors, it's terrifying, and it's a lot of fun.

The graphics are impressive. The attention to detail is incredible! When the game first gave me control of Amanda I was running around looking at every nook and cranny. Some textures are pretty low res however; computer consoles, tools, desks, etc. Along with the cut scenes. Which went from stunning to ugly, it was annoyingly inconsistent, and they're littered with a horrible frame rate. Sometimes the facial animation would look alive and believable, but in the next scene all of the characters would look stoned and detached. Same with animations as well. The pre rendered cut scenes are few and far between when it comes to the narrative, so it makes me wonder why they even bothered. Why not just make it all first person with the in game engine? Not that interactions look better there, character animation is stiff and sometimes their lips don't move when they talk. It's obvious that The Creative Assembly focused on the environments more than anything else, which is great and annoying.

Narrative is also where Isolation falls short. The story isn't bad, but it could have been more! It's so disappointing because there was so much potential with the premise. I hardly cared about the characters and forgot all of their names (except for Amanda for obvious reasons.) It's annoying, because the game clearly wants you to care. The only time I was anywhere near emotionally invested was when the plot focused on Amanda's search for her mom, which shockingly takes up a VERY small part of the story. Seriously it's sad how little it's focused on. All of this is coupled with a disappointing ending.

Over all though Isolation is fantastic. Despite my issues with the narrative and it's inconsistent presentation I loved it. It's easily one of my favorite horror games."
Jetmech1488,"Oct 14, 2014",5,"I had high hopes for Alien. While the mechanics and the story are compelling enough to keep you going, my copy of the game on PS4 had crashed multiple times and one part of the story wouldn't even trigger so I couldn't progress further. The Alien albeit scary and realistically hunting me down, wouldn't back off enough for me to get where I needed to go. The fear had worn off and it just became frustrating. The graphics and sound quality are truly immersive and realistic. I just wish my experience with the game were more technically pleasant. I really wanted to love this game and even the difficulty wasn't enough for me to trade it in, until it repeatedly kept crashing. I wouldn't have minded playing an 18-20hr game either. But for it to become monotonous and tedious to get from A to B without some sort of glitch, was more than I had expected. I can't say I have finished the game, but I definitely would have finished if it hadn't been so hard to ignore the flaws I encountered. My review only reflects my opinions and I am still going to recommend giving this one a **** I recommend renting it first. The fear and tension of dying are definitely there. And you WILL die. A LOT! I play a good game for the story, but when the bugs and technical faults get in the way of that story progressing, I stop playing and find something else worth my time."
DomMacca,"Oct 14, 2014",10,"Brilliant game. Unique, fustratiing and addictive.

Perfects Sci Fi in a game that is not all about; Kill 5 grunts, proceed through a door and repeat.

More respectul to the original film than any of the sequals that have followed and deserving of your time.

You will die alot, you will get stressed and sweat; but your meant to. The game is hard, but always fair."
SlasherX,"Oct 14, 2014",9,"I went in this game with low expectations, as you can imagine due to past experience.

I was instantly taken by the atmosphere and setting. It was an absolute perfect replication of the classic Alien movie, which directly sparked an interest to re watch the movie just to see how well it was made. As I do, I will point out the bad and the good directly:

The bad:
- Sometimes the unpredictability of the Alien AI makes you shout out of frustration when you thought you had made it, just to find out you have a freaking tail coming out of your stomach just when you were about to close the door behind you. As I said...sometimes it is bad.
- Felt a little dragged on at times, causing some repetitions for the sake of longevity.

The Good:
- Atmosphere and graphics are very good.
- Gameplay mechanics are well made making you feel well in control of the character.
- I liked the way the story slowly built up to bring you in confrontation with the alien.
- I absolutely loved the strong tension felt with the amazing music build ups in crucial moments of confrontation. If you play with headphones, you will endure mini heart attacks from the tension. Love it.
- Voice acting is good and acting good enough.
- A bit of old school ""find the key to the door"" kind of scenario in many levels, I like it.

You will get lost in this universe and many unexpected events after 2/3rds of the game will make your heart pumping, especially when you are left alone with the alien.

You feel isolated and struggling for survival.."
slim1985,"Oct 14, 2014",8,another great game this year survival/horror is my fav genre and feeling happy to play this game and waiting for the evil withing you guy should support this kind of games
DaniVR99,"Oct 13, 2014",8,"Alien: Isolation is hands down the best Alien game ever made. It has an amazing atmosphere that resembles the original 1979 movie, a fantastic and terrifying sound design, and a perfectly tuned stealth-survival horror gameplay. Of course, it is VERY challenging, but we are fighting the ALIEN, the perfect organism, right?"
HelderP,"Oct 13, 2014",10,"This game is da Bomb!! Seriously, what a gem.

If you like horror, sneaking and the Alien movie this is for you! That's all i'm going to say, I'm honestly loving this way more than I thought I was going to."
monks99,"Oct 13, 2014",9,A great game...survival horror next gen is finally here. A must play in the dark with headphones. You must have patience to play this game. Everyone will have a different experience with how often they will be killed by the **** thats a good thing.
LeChucksBeard,"Oct 13, 2014",10,"This game is a (terrifying) love letter to any person who prefers the original Alien movie to its also fantastic sequel. Even players who don't usually like horror games will feel compelled to go on and explore the picture-perfect recreation of the dark, low-high-tech sci-fi vision of the 1979's movie, filled with CRT screens, mechanical computers and steam vents.

This is not a shooter, so be prepared to hide, crouch through vents, and peer in horror at your motion detector as the beeping green blip comes closer and closer to you while you try to hold your breath and not make a noise.

The game is difficult, occasionally unfair, and has a checkpoint save system that reminds me of Dark Souls' bonfires. It all works great to build an incredible level of tension and fear, but it will also be frustrating to players who don't want to try something different to modern straightforward shooters with quicksave systems.

Technically, the game is a wonder. Graphics are the best I've ever seen, and sound is even better. Every mechanical noise will bring you back to the original movie, and the music feels dynamic and oppressive, including some cues from the original movie soundtrack. The surround audio is also brilliant, and it's just as useful as your motion detector when trying to guess where the creature is.

I can't recommend this game highly enough for fans of the first Alien movie, OR fans of horror games. For everyone else, it will probably not be their cup of tea."
Movieman4,"Oct 13, 2014",0,"This game is amazing and terrifying. This game can get too difficult at times, but its usually under control. This game is great for people who want a great lasting horror game with unscripted A.I. and force you to keep on your toe"
wormwood14,"Oct 13, 2014",9,"Difficult and strongly atmospheric, without becoming tedious and repetitive. Supplemented by nice story, evolving game-play and my favorite science fiction nightmarish terror with very good unpredictable (but logical!) AI. Definitely worth a try. Don't get put off by negative reviews. And don't expect FPS shooter - this isn't Alien vs Predator 3 or whatever."
tdebug,"Oct 12, 2014",5,"I have to say I love the original Alien story and the way how it was reproduced in this game.
However, gameplay is as clever as it was on NES consoles.

Pipes/other environment blows right when you come close to it - check
Right all of the androids suddenly became aggressive, despite all the ""impossibility"" and all, anyway they're are aggressive because it was EASIER for developers to make them so. Otherwise, helpful (as they should be) androids - boring and story enriching job - check.
Especially funny in some locations - try to run and alien will teleport to the vent right above you - check.
Alien's ""AI"" can see through walls and travel in no time between distant locations within the station. It is specifically looking for Ripley, who cares about other ppl on the station. Alien always knows where you are and always endlessly searching exactly in the premises you are now.
Tons of clichés and thinking inside the box - this is how gameplay can be described at best.

No, actually NES games were often more clever and unique.

Story, surrounding - 10.
AI, gameplay - 0."
FlyingSnotBogey,"Oct 12, 2014",8,"As usual this review will contain some spoilers and contains un-biased opinions based upon an experience of playing and fully completing this game.

**It is worth noting that for this review the PC version of this game was used on a high end system.
Graphics settings Maximum and Difficulty on Normal (Not Easy or Hard).**

Survival Horror Isolation:
Take a sprinkling of alien a dash of human a bucket of machinery and just a pinch of ""where the hell am I?"" will leave most consumers with a pleasant taste in their mouths. Although not everyone likes their steak served ""rare"" this is one prime cut that really shouldn't be overcooked.

Here's Looking at You Kid:
In accordance to routine we start with visuals and to be honest, despite it's somewhat humble approach to environment design, Isolation has some really neat graphical wizadry under the hood.  The character designs themselves ""could"" use some gloss and there are many features which seem to be lazy.  Lighting and Shadows however are masterfully done and often places would be too dark to appreciate blinding beauty.  A completely suitable design visually with credit where credit is due; the areas of exploration in the space suit, outside the station for example give you time to appreciate some of the finer visuals in Isolation.

Why the Hell Are We Here Anyway:
Moving on to first impression aspects the title ""Isolation"" doesn't really befit the game....  The station in its own right is generally populated and very rarely will you find yourself truly ""Isolated"".  As would be expected in times of dire strife, survival instincts begin to kick in.... people are desperate to stay alive and would sooner kill and ask questions later.  The autominous systems on board duely dubbed ""Working Joe's"" have also begun to go rougue (for reasons later explained in the game) and will happily request you ""Remain Calm"" while they stamp on your head and if that's not bad enough there is a highly intelligent alien assasin on board which EVERYONE is expecting YOU to get rid of.....  Sounds like the perfect scenario for a honeymoon.......

Get Under the Goddam Desk Will You:
Despite a few small pretentions; Isolation is far from being an FPS.  It has probably been said before and will be said again.... this ""flavour"" of survival beef won't tingle on everyones tastebuds.  Playing like John Rambo is rarely going to cut it.  Paitence, planning and timing are your biggest guns here and that is heavily reflected in the Alien stalking sections of the game.

Isolations contents itself are genearlly quite long and should give you enough to get your money worth out of your time.  That being said... I sure it would have felt shorter if the amount of time dying was a little leaner.  And you will die......again and again.....

Puzzles are mediocre but in contrast do not take away too much from actually having to hide most of the time, after all focus should be about staying alive. Some variety of tools seem a little pointless in difference when traversing different areas and the added frustration with some save-points being too far apart (good thing or bad thing? not sure here).

Dying a Lot:
While frustrating, it is also one of the key elements of the game.... this has to be said and because of this, it is easy to understand why some will absolutely hate this game.  The game is MEANT to be tricky..... it is meant to keep you on your toes and keep sitting under desks for 5-10 minutes at a time to avoid getting another backstabbing.  Be creative and use the crafting system to ""Make"" useful distractions at key points in order to progress, that is where this game will really shine for those with the survival instincts.

Personal Taste:
One of the greatest points for me on a ""personal"" note seems to one that is a ""beef"" for many others.  The Alien non-predictive AI.....  Not knowing exactly where and or if the Alien will show up during the Stalking sections of the games... this for me is one of the main elements I wanted to push forward.  It makes you listen... makes you pay attention and be creative.... failure to do so will probably result on you trying to predict a pattern OR indeed a ""Patrol Route"".  So after about the third time you know exactly who is going to be where etc etc and you progress......  Isolation just looks at your and declares ""Computer says no"".....  players should at least be willing to appreciate this is some nice coding..... you are not just following routine here...... you are ""Actively"" being stalked...... kudos...

Overview:

Graphics: 8/10 nicely done but could use a spit shine
Sound: 9/10 pretty damn ambient in my opinion (think of the era)
Gameplay: 7/10 nothing groundbreaking but done well enough for the purpose
Story: 7/10 progressive and relatively well done, just not enough interaction generally

Overall: 8/10 a well-rounded attempt that fills a somewhat massive gap in the Alien ""Game"" franchise with enough action to make your mum jump occasionally....."
Ayaz-Ali,"Oct 11, 2014",8,"I went into this game not thinking much of it, I didn't watch any gameplay off the game and I hated Aliens Colonial Marines. On the day of release I scoured IGN to see what score they awarded it (5.9, I didn't bother reading the actual review) I have only recently learned the credibility of IGN when it comes to review and this is in large part because of Alien: Isolation.

The only thing that inspired to me to pre-ordering the game was that I found it cheap online, could make a small profit from the game and had recently watched the brilliant 1979 Aliens movie for the first time.

That being said, the game more than exceeded my expectations. I am a big fan of horror games, dating back to Resident Evil 2 and in my opinion, Alien: Isolation wasn't scary. Yes, there were more than enough moments when I heart skipped a beat from being surprised - but they were jump scares. Alien getting you from my vent, being grabbed from the foot by an enemy - i never truly felt scared during the game, not even when the Alien was lurking. The biggest aspect of the game which did make nervous was that there were no checkpoints in the mission - your progress needs to be saved manually in whenever there is a point to do so, this meant that during long stretches I would be every scared to find a save point!

The game has eighteen different missions - so it is very lengthy, I am writing my review after completing the game which took me around 20-25 hours to do, some critics are saying that the game can feel repetitive, I don't think this is fair nor true, i appreciate longer games and this game was great almost every minute, at times I did feel like the game was dragging and was counting down how many missions were left, but I felt truly satisfied once the game ended and felt it was the perfect length.

The enemies in this game are awesome, you fight or escape from other survivors, the Alien and my favourite the Android bots, it is all very intense, the story to this game was also very fascinating. The gameplay was great and it was addictingly challenging - I found myself dying by the Alien in certain sections of the game at least 20 times, but each time I would replay it would be just as exciting as the last.

There are definitely some  negatives from the game is that Ripley the main character looks very masculine, this in no way affects the gameplay but i wanted to mention this, what does affect the gameplay and my overall experience was the lip syncing - which was way off it was frustrating. The load times were extremely long and when you call a tram to travel to another section of the game this would take very long as well (May be for suspense but still) The game was a little glitchy at times as well. There is also hardly any replay ability in the game either.

Still a fantastic game."
xale,"Oct 11, 2014",10,"I have been playing this for many hours now and it is amazing. The alien is freaking me out! I watched the first alien movie today and it was really cool to see what they have used from the film in the game. The sound in Alien Isolation is really cool, as it was in the movie. I like that you can't save when ever you like (no autosave), you have to find a station to save at. It makes it more tense and you don't want to die.. because then you have to repeat some stuff. I'm really glad they did it this way! This way I'm really careful when trying to sneak away from the alien. Story is good, same for gameplay. From crafting stuff to fun mechanics. 10/10 from me! Must buy! :)"
Anfraxx_,"Oct 11, 2014",9,"Now normally I can't play horror games as I get so drawn in to games that I jump at the simplest of games (I've been known to jump at games like Minecraft if caught off guard), but with my love for the Alien saga, I decided to give this game a go.

This game's setting is perfect, really captures the original movie perfectly and the gradual build up is amazing, you really get the feeling of something is wrong creep over you slowly after a while, whenever the lights go out you instantly panic and wonder what's going to happen, every slight movement really does get you.

My only issue with this game is the physics - for a game that did so much right it feels more like you're floating rather than walking and when you look down and see your feet, the last thing I expected was to see Ripley turn around as if she had a stick up her *** and was been turned on it.

But that really is a small issue (just don't look down) other than the odd frame rate drop there is very little wrong with this game. The main complaint I see is people saying save points are few and far between, that isn't the case, it's just finding the save point, clearly people who moan about that aren't exploring very much.

Love the Alien franchise? Get this game.

Love survival horror settings with the most bad*** hunter of them all chasing you? Get this game.

Looking for a quick fix game that you'll burn through in a few hours? This isn't that game, this game requires a lot of time and planning before making any moves otherwise game over and try again."

This game makes you feel like you are actually in the movie, as if you were on the ship trying to survive. The atmosphere is completely spot on with the movies. Just wanted to keep this review short because I am in the middle of playing the game."
SpongyTwinkies,"Oct 10, 2014",8,"My initial expectations of this game being shaped by reviews on some of the bigger game review sites, this game is far better than I had expected.

There is nothing new to this game that you haven't seen in other horror survival games. Alien Isolation borrows play mechanics from other titles such as the Last of Us, Dead Space, and Bioshock, and sets those playable elements in the Alien(s) story. That's fine, because it works in this game, too. Just don't go into this game expecting original gameplay; instead, just enjoy this game.

But even though the gameplay isn't groundbreaking, the game is woven well enough into the character's plot and most things make sense. And while I've read some complaints about the Average Joe synthetics, I did not find them to be surprising or a disconnecting story issue. They are introduced appropriately and gameplay isn't jarred by them.

What I really like is that the game doesn't try to hold your hand all the way through the experience. There are times when a character will provide guidance but you can usually explore the station somewhat freely and not follow any objectives in order. You can also quickly get yourself in trouble. Oh, and the developers presented the Aliens setting extremely well.

I had also expected the Alien to constantly hound me through the game but that's not exactly true. (Maybe that was my incorrect impression of the game based on reviews.) While there are trigger events that bring the Alien into gameplay, the game plays out a story that involves other NPCs and threats, such as the Average Joes (synthetics). You are not left flat with just a cat and mouse game with the Alien.

So despite the somewhat overdone gameplay, I am having fun playing Alien Isolation. I bought this title wanting to have an enjoyable Alien experience. I believe I've finally found a game that does this."
DumbRoDent42,"Oct 10, 2014",10,"Run, hide, get killed, do it again. And it's freakin' great.

The Alien game of my dreams, given life. A 15-20 hour session of cat-and-mouse between you and a giant, growling jungle cat of a critter, sprinkled with encounters with both humans and unnervingly third-rate, cheaply produced androids with paper skin and camera eyes. The stealth is svelte and refined. The design takes cues from the greats, especially with the brilliantly, tensely anarchistic presence of actual hard save points like the typewriters of RE's past.
Great horror setting; great horror writing; great horror game.
Oh, and the Last Survivor DLC was an Alien fan's dream gameplay experience. It left a grin on my face.

To be played in the dark, on hard, with headphones. Not for whiny, spoiled people who want to feel empowered and perfect and get through on a single golden run, so much as those that want to overcome their fears in a cold sweat and feel stronger for doing it."
pre_-cision-_,"Oct 10, 2014",10,"Alien Isolation to borrow a quote from gearbox, is a ""love letter to fans"" of the franchise. There is no reason to be skeptical this time around as Isolation might go down not only as one of the best Alien games but perhaps even the one of the best survival horror titles to ever be released. New comers who are not familiar with the movies would have no problem at all picking up this title and I would be willing to bet they would get **** into the universe of Alien franchise. For those of us who are diehard fans I can not knit pick anything with wrong with this game. Graphics, voice acting, storyline, atmosphere, gameplay mechanics, ai behavior and fan service are all at or near perfection in my book. On the hardest gameplay setting this game can be brutally difficult however you have to ask yourself, would you really want it any other way? Alien Isolation is a game meant to challenge you to survive against the deadliest killer in universe and it at all times feels that way. I'm so happy for Creative Assembly and thankful for the work they put into this game."
J227BR,"Oct 9, 2014",10,"In my opnion of Alien isolation,Creative assembly has proven themselves worthy of making a decent Alien game. the visuals are superb and just in style and tone of Ridley Scott's 1979 original, the AI overall is unique, challenging and adaptive as promised, it has a script in which I think thats worthy of the franchise. the game makes use of the PS4's gimmicks the speaker and light bar on the controller is interactive the motion tracker, where as at the same time it makes use of noise detection ad head tracking through the camera in which i  thought added to the experience. The game had good premise for survival horror"
Andred84,"Oct 9, 2014",9,"So, you think you felt fear? Trust me, you haven't, not until you try this gem. Other than laggy cut scenes, and stiff mokap, this game delivers. Although the difficulty can be frustrating at points, those of you who grew up playing games like Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden on NES won't be phased. Gamers who are fans of mindless shooters that require little to no skill may want to stay away from this one, or borrow a friends copy before buying, chances are, you won't like this title. Those seeking an adrenaline filled ride(I'm still shaking) with the most deadly species of the universe, put on your best headphones, turn off the lights and stock up on adult diapers, you're going on a hell of a ride. If your a fan of the franchise (finally an actual good Alien game!) or enjoys a good survival horror, this title is essential to your game library."
Fallun,"Oct 9, 2014",9,"Isolation does what any fan of  the Alien franchise wants. Authenticity, fear and helplessness. The game gives tools when needed but you must make them fram salvage making scarcity a prime element. The game has a very strong introductory segment that is gripping and doesnt fall into the trap of throwing the player in withought knowing at least somehow how to survive. You quickly learn that the trademark vrute force objective based mentality we are bathed in will only get you killed and is a stark reminder we are in a whole different genre.

The game hits aces on making the player feel afraid but also gives options. Something other games dont have time for. The story is riveting top notch, while me only complaint is in the PS4 version there is work to be done on non-cutscene animation fluidity and authenticity.  But never once took away from its storytelling abilities.

You really feel alone. Or better off alone. Ive waited a long time for an Alien game to please me. And i still have hope for the other side of the Aliens franchises ability to use this as inspiration for future games. This ishow the alien was meant to be seen. 9/10"
Justmatt101,"Oct 9, 2014",9,"Critics or gamers who try to down play what these developers have done are clueless.  This is one of the bravest and boldest games to come out that I can ever remember.  Not perfect.  But incredibly entertaining and unquestionably faithful to the source material.  Unscripted events abound in this game.  Whether it's the alien hunting you, or you battling it out with other survivors or the alien turning those same survivors into kibble thanks to a confrontation you ****'s simply amazing.  And scary.  Holy hell is it scary.
People who claim its too frustrating or that they died too many times....this isn't the genre for you.  And you're not playing properly.  Sorry.  You're not.  I've died.  But never to the point that it's frustrating.  Careful, considered gameplay pays off.
People who whinge that you can't fight back.....sorry, you're wrong too.  Unless shooting, braining, or burning  androids and human adversaries doesn't count.  It's simply that you need to consider whether the risk is worth that approach.  And understanding that Amanda Ripley is not ""Master Chief.""
The AI does not cheat.  The AI simply doesn't follow set routines.  If you make noise, odds are it will investigate.  If there's no reason to think you couldn't have left a corner of the map, that SOB will look for you with will and a purpose.  You just need to figure a way out.
The length is fine.  Could it have been trimmed a little?  Sure.  But it's never tedious.  And frankly, I enjoyed every minute...every image..every sound.  It's like you're in the flipping Alien universe.  All that's missing are the smells.
Replayability?  Yep.  Survivor mode is awesome for a quick fix.  They'll be adding to it as part of the season pass (yes, season passes are  separate discussion but I think this one will be worth it). And even with the campaign, understand that outside of a few set events the alien will never be in the same place, never act exactly the same way every time you play.  Items are in different locations.  There are not guarantees.  Hell, I'll play again to see just how far I can get without dying.
If you're a fan of the franchise or horror games, period, you need to pick this up."
an55192,"Oct 9, 2014",10,"Have been playing this with headphones at night in completely darkness and what an amazing game. I'm big Alien fan and this is that game what I have always been wanted to been made from the Alien movies.
It's for sure, that Isolation isn't for everyone, but if you're familiar with the movies you have to try this out.

Greetings from Finland."
Chad11491,"Oct 8, 2014",10,"I never do reviews, but I feel this game deserves one. The people giving this negative reviews don't understand the game. This is a survival horror game. It will be slow paced, stressful, and the AI is unpredictable. That's on purpose, it's the nature of the beast. The Alien has tricked me a few times, and it's impressive. This is the best AI I've seen for this type of game. The setting is perfect, the suspense is right on, and the game can be genuinely terrifying. The sound is amazing, and you owe it to yourself to play it with high quality headphones. I have absolutely 0 complaints about this game. It is not only (in my opinion) the best alien game ever made, but among the top survival horror games I have ever played. This is my game of the year, and simply one of the best games I have played in a very long time, even though it's probably taken a year off my life at this point! And that's probably the best compliment I can give a game like this."
Kikuchiyo,"Oct 8, 2014",9,"Finally an Alien game worthy of the name and the license.  Rarely have I been so tense playing a video game.  The atmosphere is spot on from the original film and completely immersive.  Periods of atmosphere followed by nail biting moments were you cower under a table as the alien stalks you, your breath in your throat as it skulks about your hiding spot.  This is not a game for the faint of heart or for those without patience.  If you hurry, you will die, if you don't choose your moments carefully, you will die, if you don't plan ahead walking into encounters you will die.  And even if you do everything right the unpredictable nature of the AI may still turn around at the most inopportune moment and you will die.  Many complaints about the game are that there are limited save points coupled with long stretches of frustrating deaths to reach the next.  Contrary to nay-sayers there are actually plenty of save points along the way.  The challenge is reaching them undetected long enough to save.  That is part of what makes this game great.  It is merciless, hard and unforgiving.  That unto itself is part of the horror.  Knowing that you have played for an hour or more of progress with that save spot just next door and you being desperate to reach it.  However, the alien is skulking and hissing around it, or about you in your hiding spot hampering your ability to reach it.  Or upon reaching that save point you screaming at the screen to “hurry up and save” as Ripley punches in the 3 second code necessary to save your progress before being spotted.  However, as scary as the game is we all know that it is just a game and our real lives are not on the line as the creature devours your face time and time again.  So how to simulate that same tension level in a gamer sitting in their cushy living room couch in “Everytown” USA?  Make it so that you have something to risk and not just the virtual life of Amanda Ripley on your big screen TV.  Make it so it has something tangible to you, something every gamer fears…lost progress.  Not only are you afraid of the alien lurking about with crescendoing horror music blaring through your speakers, but of also losing your precious effort and game time to reach that next objective.  Yes you will die, yes you cry out as you lose an hour or more of progress.  And it will happen often.  Unlike CoD you will not respawn were you left off ready to frag another player a half block away from your derezzing corpse.  This is not CoD and if you are a gamer that likes that genre and expect that type of gameplay from a horror game than this is not the game for you.  This is about heightened stress and terror and the developers have made it to be as such.  You on the edge of your seat through this ride and if it was an easy go there would be a flurry of complaints that the game is too simplistic and over and done with too quickly.  On the contrary, every objective here seems an accomplishment, every save point a victory.  I found that after hitting a save I would regularly slump back into my chair sometimes mentally and emotionally drained from an hour long Epinephrine rush.  Pausing the game to catch ones breath is a luxury that Amanda Ripley wouldn't enjoy in that virtual world being stalked by one of the deadliest creatures in the galaxy.  A real challenge would be to be to eliminate the ability to pause and to keep that tension going to experience how the character would truly feel in that situation.  Complaints about the scripting of the alien AI are bogus.  There few sections where the alien is scripted to appear at story driven segments as it is dropped into a level with you or to force a particular plot point.  Beyond that the AI is brilliant, unpredictable and adaptive.  Every encounter feels unique as it moves and hunts in seemly random patterns.  It will stalk a circle of rooms or halls 3 times only to suddenly jump into a vent or reverse direction catching you in mid stride when you think you have it figured out.  You will pat yourself on the back for outsmarting and ditching the blasted thing 2 rooms back only to have it drop out from an overhead vent in front you, sending you scurrying for cover.  Overall the game has delivered what it promised, a tense horror game from one of the great movie franchises in Sci-Fi history.  It is tribute to the original material and worthy of Ridley Scott's vision and the roots of the series.  Top that off with DLC from the movie it is a must for any Alien fan.    Hopefully the remaining DLC still to come will add more levels from some of the other films.  Would love to see a scene from Alien 3 with the dog alien bounding down a prison vent shaft toward you.  Turn off the lights, crank the volume on the surround sound, make some popcorn, and be prepared to bite your nails and fire off a curse word or three.  Alien: Isolation is a murderous mistress and will challenge your patience and sanity.  Kudos to the developers for their effort!"
AhmedShehab95,"Oct 8, 2014",4,"Run,Hide,Run,Get killed and do it all again.

Alien Isolation is not what you are expecting it to be,The gameplay is stressful and unstable with a mix of repetitivity,The AI is
unpredictable which may cause some problems during gameplay,Save points are very poor systemized when you need to travel from point A to Point
B just to save!they should've added checkpoint autosaves.

The single player campaign is good lengthed but it's poorly told with no excitment at all it's really slow you'll get bored of it after an hour or two and you'll be wanting just to leave the game
ASAP.

The envoirment here is running on closed space ship and there's not too much left for the player except for those closed places in that ship IT'S REALLY
BORING ATOMSPEHERE.

Final Verdict:
It's another hyped game like Destiny,it may be slightly better than Colienil Marines and it's def. not worth your money and time,it could've been better but unfortuntely it's medicore
soundtrack and graphics may help to rise the rating up a bit but still it's not worth wasting your time."
Alexa431,"Oct 7, 2014",10,"What an amazing game, I will say that its difficult but an incredibly tense game as well. Just what I was looking for in a horror genre. I would get desperate to find a save point before getting attacked by the Alien.
About the survival mode, its even more intense, as you are being timed and aiming for a high score, the only bad part about it, is that included in the game you only have one map and if you want other maps and characters you would need to get the season pass. But overall A really good game the Alien AI is sick especially in hard, I would call it a simulator to the Alien movies."
justin_cantrell,"Oct 7, 2014",10,"This game's setting (if your an Alien fan) is so amazing.First off the sound design,it's amazing,the atomisphere is breathtaking.This game is not for everybody,gamer's who want a quick fix,or are looking for something that give's them immediate gradification,may want to look elsewhere,it's a slow burn,but one that pays off,it's can be chilling at time's."
Makaveli,"Oct 7, 2014",9,"Well, all I can say is that this game is a step in the right direction.. I wasn't too hyped for this game because of what they did to  the last installment, but I felt like I had to buy it as an Alien fan..
The atmosphere is just great, the sound is awesome. feels like a true horror experience with decent A.I for a change.., I could see non Alien fans really enjoying this game.. So why didn't I give it a 10?

Well... it's a step in the right direction for sure, and it is a great game, just at times I feel that the game can be ""slow"" I found that at times I had a hard time paying attention and I do not even have A.D.D, however once you start to get bored the ""action"" picks up again.. I also found a few bugs where I got stuck on a few things and couldn't move but I guess they will patch that.

Great game- 8.5"

Is flawed, I admit. But not at all overshadowing the quality of a title that has come on tiptoe without making much noise. This is not a AAA but that is why it deserves all my love."
Noble-Saint,"Oct 7, 2014",10,"the game're very good, and well done the hard **** not have a game of alien so good, congratulations for sega could fulfill What had promised........"
mileswayne10,"Oct 7, 2014",9,"Alien Isolation delivers everything that it promised, that being a unscripted A.I the Alien, authentic atmosphere and ultimately a survival horror experience reminiscent of the good old resident evil and silent hill days.

The game play is nothing groundbreaking but it doesn't need to be. The game made me feel how i did during my time with resident evil all those years ago, with locked doors, key cards, special items and gradual weapons and gear to be found. This experience really makes you feel isolated and vulnerable, you also feel powerless and every step feels like progress and a achievement that you have survived.

Comparing the game with the original 1979 Alien, the game is ultimately immerse in fact id go as far as saying its most immerse experience I have ever had the delight to play especially with authentic the atmosphere is. There is a crafting system in place to help you along the way, those who have played The Last Of Us will appreciate the system. Although Alien Isolation requires a balance of skill, patience and luck to use the system to your advantage due to how under powered you are and the enemy difficulty. Unfortunately you will die allot but the crafting system is here to aid your progression and ultimately the game wants you to learn from your mistakes this only adds to the suspense and immersion that you are trying to survive.

I wont go into detail about the story as the first 10 minutes is very self explanatory and ties in perfectly with the first film, the story does progress nicely with plenty of cut scenes, twists and scares to be found along the way. My only negative is I have been unable to use my pre order pass on ps4 for nostromo edition due to an error and a few minor bugs such as stuttering and frame rate drops. I believe a patch is in progress to fix many issues.

Overall i rate the game 9/10 and believe this to be one of the best survival horror experiences ever to be made. 1979 Alien fans will appreciate all the art work detail and the authentic soundtrack. Play with headphones for a more immerse and satisfying experience."
hb1209,"Oct 7, 2014",10,"If it has a Alien game so far managed to bring the atmosphere and the subtle horror of the first Alien movie is over, then that is certainly Alien: isolation. To be delivered, the helplessness and the constant feeling captivate us even in quiet passages and provide pass for voltage. The fact that behind every door and around every corner death could be waiting for us, offers exactly this kind of horror that made the first Alien movie so famous. Fans would appreciate any more aliens, but are likely to feel comforted by the neat fabulous atmosphere. Who's afraid of the dark and prefer to defend against opponents rather than avoid them, should avoid this item. Horror enthusiasts can with Alien: nothing wrong isolation."
audreyvixen,"Oct 7, 2014",10,"Alien Isolation delivers one of the most harrowing and unnerving survival horror experiences in years. Capturing the vibe of the first film with absolute precision.

the sound design and presentation is impeccable, the alien an unstoppable force whose unpredictable nature makes every second of the game feel nauseating. The voice acting is sublime and it is a universe to get lost in (no pun intended)

Creative Assembly have not only created one of the best survival games in years, but one of the best alien franchise experiences since James Cameron's sequel in the 80's.

it is claustrophobic, violent, heart stopping and you will die over and over again.

the ride will be worth it."
