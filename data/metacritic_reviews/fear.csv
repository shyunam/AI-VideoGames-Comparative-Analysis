adamflame7,"Jun 14, 2024",8,"A solid old school shooter. It's not trying to do too much and pulls off what it is doing quite well. I pretty quickly understood why the game gets mentioned and complemented on the enemy AI. They take cover, they flank, they're pretty accurate and pose a very real threat in most encounters. I couldn't get the idea of this being Half Life plus horror out of my head. Some of the level design, shooting, physics, and movement felt very like that of HL. All in all, a pretty solid horror fps, that both makes you feel very powerful at times yet still manages to keep my hair standing up at times.
I am a mega scaredy cat when it comes to horror and I did ""okay"", not super friendly, but not too in your face. It does need a couple easy tweaks to play well on modern hardware."
Cristiano_Lin,"Apr 4, 2024",4,"First some good things, really good Ai even for today. The Graphics are also good for 2005 and the controls aren't bad, nothing special. I really don't know what is happening in the story, you follow one guy and more I don't know. The game feels like a mix between Doom 3, a new guy have to fight against some randomn enemys on his own. The other part of the mix is a generic shooter. This game is nothing special,if I have to discribe it in on sentence I would say: It is like Doom 3, but Enemys have guns and they are smarter."
OzgurOri,"Mar 15, 2024",9,"I don't understand how it is possible to make a game like this in 2005. Its artificial intelligence is smarter than most people I know and it often feels like it is reading your mind, but despite this, it offers a very balanced difficulty. IT IS DEFINITELY A GAME THAT EVERYONE SHOULD TRY AT LEAST ONCE."
legitretard16,"Feb 1, 2024",10,"Truly amazing. The feeling of shooting in slow-motion with the shotgun is just superb. It's a shame we don't get games like this anymore. True, the story is obviously a b-movie plot, but the way they have carried it forward with the cinematics, you just have a keen interest on what's going to happen next. The A.I. of the enemies are also outstanding. Definitely a must try!!"

Richard_dias,"Aug 15, 2023",9,"The first of its kind, F.E.A.R. is high regarded as one of the best FPS games ever, and I do agree with that! Very good level design, art direction and pretty fun action packed combat."
M300,"Aug 3, 2023",5,"The game **** at scaring you, and if the scares don't work it turns out to be mostly a corridor shooter but with quite good AI and decent gun mechanics.

I can't leave a negative because this is a review from 2023, for 2005 this is an epic level of technical achievement that can be felt whilst playing, it's quite eye opening just how bad some newer games are at AI and gun play.

The game becomes repetitive by around interval 5, it loses all of it's magic if any it had to start with.

There is zero difficulty to any enemy engagement if you are around average or above average at shooting with a mouse.

I played on medium difficulty and thought I was playing in a hospital because there were so many med packs and I was always full of them, I also forgot I had a slow-mo feature because enemy encounters were that easy.

Other than that though? yeah it's a run of the mil shooter campaign not bad and by today's standards not good either."

O3liveon,"Dec 18, 2022",8,"This game for the standards in 2005, is incredible! They really did a good job here adding not only a fantastic horror story but implement and take bullet time to the next level. I was 15 when this game was released and I can remember being scared, intrigued and loving the excellent combat! Admittedly it's not great in 2022 (at the time of writing this) but still pretty darn fun actually.
You can see how cool and technically built it was back then, but it is very old. You have to be willing to allow yourself to enjoy old games to like it, but I think you should. This is a must play and a great addition to the books of gaming history."

r03vg,"Feb 22, 2022",7,"Враги умны не по годам. А ещё так страшно, что я кирпичный завод отстроил."
piglordofallham,"Feb 17, 2022",7,"F.E.A.R. was an absolute classic that, at least within its own genre and series, has yet to be dethroned, but is it quite as remarkable as people remember it?  I played F.E.A.R. or ""First Encounter Assault Recon,"" -which doesn't really roll off the tongue as well as the accronym, but I digress- way back in 2006 and you can for sure bet I barely had a computer that could run it at the time.  Of course over the years that issue has been made null and void, but coincedentally what was once difficult to run on older hardware has become even more difficult to run on modern hardware for various reasons.

Let me just rip off the bandaid here for anyone who's still too hardheaded to admit it:  F.E.A.R. is not as good as we all remember.  The first hour?  Pretty great, but even after multiple playthroughs the entire Armacham office is a total blur and I don't care how many times someone reminds me what the last few levels were, because I could not recall them from memory without watching a video or reading a synopsis.  F.E.A.R. as a game is weak in areas that at the time we weren't too upset about.  Doom 3 had come out the year before, as well as Half-life 2, the latter remaining probably the best (but not perfect) shooter from that decade, though F.E.A.R.'s first foray still collects accolades for its particular blend of combat.  For one, its like May Payne, SHOGO and Half-life had a baby, but this baby also inherited every trope, cliche, and stereotype from whatever pop culture thing was relevant when it came out.  Creepy ghost girls?  Check.  Nerdy fat slob who secretly betrays you? Check.  Generic black uniformed enemies with very little variation?  Check-a-roo, and lets not forget the slowmotion ""effect"" that was slapped onto the game because hit-scan guns from enemies were the go-to method back then and are what probably gave people the impression that the A.I. in this game was mildly intelligent.

The game was always a hodge-podge of very marketable generic FPS trends and features a very lackluster line-up of weapons that feel good to shoot, but lack the inventiveness of even the heavily criticized Half-life 2 or Halo series.  The levels are very linear, featuring barely any twists or turns, though they have slightly different routes, but those are just hallways that happen to meet at some other junction.  As far as the game play is concerned, its great fun, or was really enjoyable at the time, but now it can be absolutely blown right through when you realize how bad the A.I. actually is and how much they CHEAT to locate you in most instances.  The enemies always know where the pointman is, but they pretend they don't due to the way they're programmed to engage you.  Now remember, this game occasionally gets huge compliments in the AI department and this was even after the original Halo made large maps accomplishing the very same thing years before F.E.A.R. saw the light of day.

The list of dumb advantages that make the game moderately unenjoyable later are mostly just the few beefcake enemies that have huge health pools and the big robot mechs you find later.  The shooty-shooty-bang-bang was always entertaining and players will often reload quicksaves just to try things a little differently or maybe optimize gunfights or even experiment, but that is the experience people enjoyed about the game.  Not the story, not the ""characters,"" not the voicemails, and certainly NOT the final boss fight (if you can even call it that).  The sequels were so bad, I often wonder if they even had a good concept to begin with for any sort of overarching plot, and I'd go as far to say that the backdrop for the first game really only worked in the first game.  Visually and aurally speaking, those were all knockout features in the game that really helped sell the atmosphere, though the jump scares are extremely archaic by today's standards and wore out their welcome after the first few times you happen to encounter them.  The original F.E.A.R. game has a whole host of problems on newer machines, you have some graphical glitches, problems at higher frame rates, problems without V-sync on, mouse input issues that require a dinput fix, and the original EAX effects are somewhat broken even with Creative Alchemy's software ""restoration"" and it just kind of **** that the engine itself was so miserably proprietary (thanks Monolith- that's like every one of your titles).  I know in my head how F.E.A.R. played, what it looked like, and sounded like way back when, so obviously it **** that I can't even play that version of it without weird issues.

I know this comes down to subjectivity, but I think F.E.A.R. was kind of a one-off.  It was a really remarkable game, not brilliant, but certainly had some of more memorable gunfights, though in my experience even the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series had more depth and more options in terms of how you could approach its combat scenarios."

BFG-1337,"Apr 22, 2021",6,"Really smart A.I., they do all kinds of tactics and I love how they behave In general just super exciting and difficult on harder.
Great graphics for the year it released and amazing physics.
Where this game flops and falls flat on its face is the level design and the horror, its really not scary and the level design is worse than Half-Life (1998), Its really dull and uninspired level design, just as the game gets good it suddenly gets very boring and bland because of the level design..
The horror scenes are so predictable they instantly break immersion because it does that transition into ""horror land"" and you know you cant get hurt in the horror land because its just like a flash back or something...
This feels like a very long tech demo to show off its AI and great graphics and physics.

6/10 - Some excellent AI, probably the best ever seen In a video game, held back by its claustrophobic and very flat level design.."
SgAkErRu,"Apr 13, 2021",9,"Перепрошел недавно эту игру, в последний раз запускал лет 10 назад. Прикольная игруля.

Хороший графон на момент выхода, да и щас неплох, выглядит не мультяшно. Многим в этой игре нравится боёвка и ИИ противников. Ну да, так и есть, боевка что на 2005 год, что сейчас - очень неплоха, играется бодро, ИИ тоже неплох. В довесок у игры хорошее звуковое сопровождение (эмбиент и музон, но есть и средние, и плохие треки), и как по мне, очень неплохая атмосфера. Сами пугалки конечно не пугают, но в целом антураж поддерживают.

И все же игра душновата местами - однотипные локации, полчища клонов, которых надоедает по кд стрелять. Насчет сюжета особо многого не скажу, разрабы все же упор делали на геймплей, а не на него, но в принципе для такого шутана - он в общем-то ничего.

По поводу продолжения - мое мнение, что саму серию надо было заканчивать на дополнении Extraction Point (хоть это дополнение и не от самих Монолит), потому-что все последующее - это какой-то мегакринж. [8.5/10]"

AlexKVideos1,"Feb 20, 2021",8,"F.E.A.R. plus its expansion packs Extraction Point, and Perseus Mandate, are some of the most intriguing games I've played. Horror was never a genre of games I could get into, however these games blend horror with great first person action. This game reminds me of a tech demo, but made into a very serviceable game. The story is not ever super clear, but its great piecing it together, and making sense of the world, and the crazy **** happening in it. Voice acting is done very well, and isn't cringy in any way. The atmosphere is just perfect, with the gray, and brown color scheme that just works. Gun fights consists of ricochets, sparks, smoking, intense gun fire that is a beautiful sight to see. However, one thing became pretty apparent, especially during the play throughs of the expansions packs: The padded out campaign.

The story and action is usually drip feed when walking through the huge levels, and without the ability to run, it makes it slower going through the levels, and backtracking for equipment.

Other than this complaint, F.E.A.R. is a great game. A must have for PC players!"

PublicNuisance,"Jan 1, 2021",9,"F.E.A.R. is one of the all time greatest first person shooters. That is something I believed back in 2005 and something I still believe now. It has some of the most satisfying combat I have ever had the satisfaction of playing and one of the best uses of slow mo I have seen next to Max Payne. There are plenty of weapons to choose from and all are fun to use in their own way. Every firefight just felt like pure unadulterated fun. The story is fantastic and one of the few times I would say it would be movie worthy without much if any changes needed. The graphics were top notch for their time. Blood; gore; facial detail; dust and smoke particles in gunfights; shadows; lighting; it was all mind blowing. The soundtrack was well done especially in the intro which is one of the finest intros I have ever seen. The voice acting is great all around. The storytelling devices were well sued as you can find laptops with backstory; find voicemails with current info as well as news reports that shed light on how the story is effecting the city. The AI was also some of the best I have seen and that is still true today sadly. The enemies work as a group; communicate about your strategy as well as to each other; they try to flush you out and flank you. The gaming world has had fifteen years to advance enemy AI in games and few if any have taken steps to even be as good as F.E.A.R. let alone better. The only criticisms I can offer are that I would have liked more info on just how Alma got her powers and what happened to Jankowski. I also think the game lacked a true end confrontation; it felt a bit out of place compared to the previous 8 hours of play.

In this most recent play through I played F.E.A.R. on Linux using Wine and Lutris. It did crash on me one time with an error stating “out of memory” but other than that ran without issue and the performance was great. The game has twenty graphics settings; two AA options; and six AF options. Alt-Tab worked. You could pause and skip cut scenes. You could manually save whenever you wanted and there were ten save slots to do so or you could let the game simply save at checkpoints. You could change the difficulty at any time. The game does have some odd physics at times where bodies will rag doll off the ground even after death. I’m not sure if this is an issue with Wine or something that is just a game issue.

If you enjoy first person shooters in the slightest you owe it to yourself to play F.E.A.R. It is the total package of graphics; AI; game play and sound. The pacing was done well. It took me eight hours and nine minutes to beat the game on the extreme difficulty setting which didn’t feel too long nor rushed. I originally paid $56.48 CAD for F.E.A.R. when it first released. It retails for $12.89 CAD at the time of writing this. I can honestly say it is worth whatever they wanted to charge for it. I thought $56.48 was fair and I would think $100 was fair if they asked it of me.

guiletheguiles,"Jul 12, 2020",8,"I've been meaning to replay F.E.A.R. for quite a while and I'm glad that I enjoyed it just as much as I did, back when I first played. While it didn't age VERY well, it still plays like a charm, owing a lot to the first Half Life.

Love it or hate it, F.E.A.R., alongside RE4, is one of the best games to blend horror and action together. It's a little more action oriented than it should, but its suffocating creepy atmosphere and ominous pacing keeps you on your toes. You never know if you're going to get jumpscared by a terrifying little girl or shot by a dozen heavy armored replica soldiers. It seems weird and it kinda is, but it works! I believe that half of the reason why it works is due to its strange story. It a mystery told in 11 chapters that still grips me to this day. It's not INCREDIBLY well-written, but it's engaging. It made me want to get to the ending and uncover whatever the hell was happening in the Origin project. Alma, Fettel and even you, the silent protagonist, are driving forces in a quiet story that, in my opinion, did not disappoint.

Gameplay is also quite competent. Weapon variety is good, using SlowMo gives you a huge boost in combat, guns are impactful and the action is way more tactical than I remembered. Enemy variety ****, but the AI compensates, since they constantly try to flank you, react to your actions and force you to play smart to get to the next area. And while the game might be challenging, it plays so nice that I love how accessible it is for anybody to just pick up and shoot.
One other thing that I LOVE is the sound design. Horror games usually nails this, but F.E.A.R. took it to another level. Do play this with a headset, please!

F.E.A.R.'s biggest enemy is the level design. I usually prefer linear games than sandbox/open-world ones, but this is a perfect example of linear design gone terribly wrong. Levels are a repetitive, unimaginative and bland hallway fest. Some corridors feel like labyrinths. I got lost so many times on some areas that I just got bored! The pacing is not bad, but its straightforward nature hurts how well the game could hold up nowadays.
I may love the story, but MY GOD does it take its time to unfold. You're basically left in the dark for the first 7 chapters, with minimal information and the same objective. And It's not like they did not have anything to reveal, they just decided to wait and rush it by the end. I love the final chapters, but if the game just focused in telling the story and frightening you more than throwing more enemies in the way, it would be much better.
Also, whose idea was to make the flashlight so annoying? And why are there MECHS in the game? They feel so out of place...

F.E.A.R.'s problems did not break the game in any way for me. This is still an amazing hair-raising experience.
It's easy to recommend this to anyone, since it works so well as an fps and as a horror game.
Sure, it didn't age like a fine wine, but it does its job of keeping you hooked and terrified."

Hannibaal,"Jun 20, 2020",9,"Es un juego de disparos en primera persona puro y duro, pero además tiene algo mas, la ambientación y los momentos de terror (que no son muchos pero si efectivos),  hasta ese momento era algo nuevo para un juego de disparos en primera persona y que yo sepa después no se ha visto una mezcla similar, además el tiempo bala también fue una innovación en el género y la I.A de los enemigos fue muy impresionante en su momento. Por eso F.E.A.R es un juego especial. El diseño de niveles no es complejo pero si efectivo y la I.A de los enemigos es sobresaliente especialmente en como interactua con los escenarios, ejemplo de un juego bien diseñado y equilibrado, quizás el tiempo bala rompe a veces el equilibrio. Solo los scripts contra fantasmas me parecieron aburridos y repetitivos, el juego en su conjunto sobresaliente y el paso del tiempo lo demuestra, los juegos muy buenos lo son siempre por mucho tiempo que pase."

The_Nametag,"Feb 10, 2020",3,"This game is frequently hailed as one of the only truly scary FPS games made. A game rich in atmosphere, and setting, that drives you to keep playing it.

I just don't see it. I have tried to get into this game. I want to like it. But I just can't. I can't now, and I couldn't ten years ago when it first came out, the first time I tried to play it. Nothing in the game, nothing in the story, makes me want to keep playing.

That is not to say the game doesn't have its strong points. The AI in this game is top notch, and holds up well even today. The enemies will try to flank you, surround you, they react to being seen, being shot at. They'll throw grenades, they'll fire from cover. They really are some of the best AI I have ever seen. And the game should be played if just for this alone. (Edit: This only applies to the first enemy type you see, the soldiers. When you start getting to the invisible robot ninjas (I am not kidding), the good AI goes right out the window. I witnessed two of them performing a Scooby-Doo routine of running back and forth randomly between the rooms in a hallway, simply because I had my gun pointing down the hallway so they wouldn't come at me. It was hilariously pathetic.)

But there are also problems. There's no on-screen indication when you take a hit. Your life goes down, and that's it. So you could be in a fire fight, shooting from cover, and thinking you're doing well, only to find yourself on the edge of death. Because you didn't know that the enemy was hitting more shots than not. Or didn't realize that someone had gotten to your side, and was free to open up on you. That severely hurts this game. (Edit: There actually IS a visual indicator. But it is on the very edge of the screen, and flashes by so quickly that I literally did not notice it for more than three hours of gameplay.)

They also made a bizarre choice with the weapon and ammo mechanic. In an effort to make you switch weapons often (you can only carry three at a time), when picking up a new weapon it comes with a full magazine loaded, and enough ammo for a second. However, if you already have a weapon of that type, when you pick the new one up for more ammo, you get roughly a third of a magazine. Of course, you can game this system by first tossing your weapon on the ground, picking up the new one (which is now reloaded for you), and then picking up your old one with all the ammo you had before. You'll start to do this very rapidly once you find a weapon you like.

Also, despite being only ten years old, the game does not run well on modern systems. Disabling ""HID-Compliant Device"", and in my case ""HID-Compliant Vendor-Defined Device"" is required to make the game run at anything higher than 6-7 FPS. So don't expect your gaming keyboards and mouse to function when you play this game, and be prepared to reenable those when you have finished.

There are other problems. The game forces ""Letterboxing"" when it does cinematics. Even if you're using a wide-screen monitor and resolution. So expect to see black bars and the top and bottom of an already wide-screen image. And the FMV cut-scenes are letterboxes as well, but set in 4:3 ratio, so they'll be displayed with a box with black bars on all sides.

So what about the story? Well, this was before the ""scary little girl"" trope was completely overplayed. But even so, nothing in this seems to work. There's a few pseudo jump-scares, and some places where the graphics will change on you into another, ""spooky"" scene. But both Max Payne and even Postal 2 of all things had done this years before. (Quick edit: The Postal 2 expansion that featured this was released the same year as F.E.A.R., but five months before.) And to a better effect. In fact, that might be one of the problems I had with this game ten years ago. It so desperately wants to play like Max Payne, but with a horror twist (""Bullet Time"" - the slow motion effect - was featured in Max Payne as well). But this game just didn't seem to push hard enough.

There's a level of interactivity... but it's so painfully limited that you notice more when you CAN'T do something than when you can. You can only do anything with phones if they're already flashing with a voice mail message. You walk by a radio and can't turn it on yourself, but some will spout something directly from the Exposition News Network, letting you know a plot update... and then promptly fall silent again. There are blocked doors, sometimes you can figure out a way to open them, but frequently they can't be. And, again, to put in perspective as to the environment when this game came out, System Shock 2 and Deus Ex had both been out for half a decade before this game was released.

The game shows its age now. But it wasn't fresh and exciting when it came out. F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon (which, BTW, Assault and Recon are kinda mutually exclusive, but they had to fit that name in somehow) was a game that was trying to just exist."

mr-NachoMen,"Jul 14, 2018",9,"Monolith's F.E.A.R. is a unique experience in gaming, it mix perfectly the blockbuster action from a first person shooter with horror elements. The core gameplay mechanic relies on slow motion in combat to take down enemies  easily when needed.
For being a game released in 2005, the game features the most advanced AI in gaming history and still one of the most advanced after 12 years of it's release, enemies react to you combat tactics they will regroup, take cover and even make their own combats paths. It was one of the few games that it started featured dynamic lighting and shadows just like Doom 3 in 2004 with tons of particle effects and some little destructible environment to add some Emerson, so in a few words it was a tech improvement. The game play pretty well in solid 60 FPS, but with modern hardware the game might crash in higher resolutions, but still playable.
The story however it's an intriguing plot that unveils around Alma and Fettel, still pretty descent for a horror game. This is more a horror game than a shooter even that it looks contrary, at the end the most important part of the game are the combat, horror and the visuals.
Wish more games can have this level of immersion and a high advanced AI on them!!"

Captain_Chaos,"Jun 22, 2016",10,"2/15/2012: Some time ago after first getting an Xbox 360, I grabbed FEAR and Gears of War, thinking they both looked fun. Gears is fun, sure. But FEAR turned out to be my favorite singleplayer FPS ever. It's not really the gameplay that stands out, but the story, and the feeling of the game. Even without any of that it would be a very fun single-player FPS, but the sheer creep factor made me replay it again and again. Monolith created an enemy both terrifying and supremely tragic in Alma. FEAR might not scare most people, since it is at its core a series of Matrix-like gun battles and jump scares. Doom 3 tought me that monsters in a closet can't scare you if you've got a gun. You many not fear Alma. But you will glimpse into her mind, and you will know her terror of loss, entrapment and sheer, unbridled rage. Fear not sewers and empty warehouses. Fear instead the shadows of your own mind- for that is where Alma lurks."
llamayarmybar,"Apr 5, 2016",8,"Does F.E.A.R. have a great storyline?  No, not particularly amazing.  Do some of its psychic spooks give players the jitters?  No, its not terribly scary whatsoever, though you may find a jump scare or two.  I think what the game does very well is atmosphere.  Besides the sound design being absolutely killer, (taking full advantage of environmental audio and surround sound set ups) F.E.A.R. has a way of isolating the player completely.  It does this by pitting you against a backdrop of psychic clone super soldiers, ghostly phenomena, cramped office complexes, and of course the games antagonist ""Paxton Fettel.""  It establishes fairly early on that you are the ""point man"" which means your automatically the silent protagonist throughout the entire game, so of course you'll be hearing most of the supporting characters progressing the story along either via headset or answering machine messages.  This isn't exactly original and most of the information you get is really just there to keep the plot from getting dull.  Of course its all rather pointless in the end because quite simply, the best parts of the game are going to be, hands down, the gameplay itself.  The combat is immensely enjoyable, though not brutal unless you have selected ""extreme"" difficulty when starting a new game, and is the reason that First Encounter Assault whatever even lodged its way into our collective memories.  Its just such a freaking joy to have gunplay that works, a ""bullet time"" mechanic (borrowed from Max Payne of course), a decent selection of weapons to utilize (though late game weapons are a little over powered) and linear, but well crafted levels to do it all in.  Some of the highest points in the game are fairly early on, but the Armacham office complex is easily the best portion of the game.  It starts slow, but it builds tension really well by going from silent office cubicles, meeting rooms, dark hallways, to all out ballistic battles, cloaked assailants, surprise attacks and finally a parking garage shootout before the level ends.  This is sadly right before the game trips over something in the dark.  Suddenly everything becomes very sloppy.  It drops all its earlier accomplishments and instead trades those wonderful intense gunfights with the occasional splash of mysterious intrigue, for a drawn out last level that will have you wishing the game had ended 45 minutes earlier.  It just never really gets back on its feet and instead decides to culminate everything into a bizarre psychic ghost ""fight"" that isn't challenging or even fun.  The whole thing feels like they didn't quite have an idea of how they wanted to end the game.  Instead it just feels like forced exposition from characters we don't even know or care about.  The strongest elements I feel are definitely the early levels and their respective themes, the few claustrophobic areas are where everything really works (mechanically speaking), and it doesn't hurt the pacing of the game to toss in the occasional spooky sequence.  Of course their are in fact far too many attempts at jump scares, some of which are quite difficult to spot.  If the player isn't paying attention or is looking the wrong direction you will miss tons of them.  These are just sequences where something semi-scary is happening near you, but like I said- most people will miss them inadvertently.  The first 50 percent of F.E.A.R. is loads of fun, but the title as a whole?  Not that great.  Its much better than your average first person shooter, it looks great (even in 2016), it plays great (especially important in 2016), its aged quite well and its fairly short too.  The horror doesn't really work in my opinion because it can't decide if its a science fiction or a horror film, the characters are bland and not even remotely interesting.  The enemies are lifeless spawns that shoot everything you shoot, the weapons are fairly generic until late game, the jump scares are cheap, and the slow motion bullet time is far too exploitative- a.k.a. it ruins the challenge.  All in all, its got some great parts, but once again they don't all fit together as well as they could."
GamingEnderman,"Dec 1, 2015",9,"F.E.A.R is a really Good Game that has really good FPS Gameplay and the Main Antagonist is Super Creepy, Even though some People thinks/Says that this Game has no replay Value, I think that the game has some Replay Value if you are planning to Challenge Yourself and Crank up the Difficulty all the way.

LegionIscariot,"Oct 7, 2015",9,"F.E.A.R. Platinum: FEAR + FEAR Extraction Point + FEAR Perseus Mandate

FEAR is a very fun FPS game. This is mostly due to reflex time (slow motion). Without it i doubt the game would be as good.
There is also the creepy atmosphere that keeps it interesting, although not creepy enough.

The gameplay is where this game shines for me, its great, better than modern FPS's:
You are able to hold up to 3 weapons.
There is no button to go into cover, instead you stand or crouch behind walls and objects and can lean out to shoot.
No regenerating health. You can carry 10 health packs. And pick up armor.
No cut scenes, you're always in control of the protagonist
And of course the slow mo.

The game is gory. You can tear enemies apart with bullets. Even blow heads off with shotguns

The story is pretty good, characters are good even though you spend most of your time alone and dont get to interact with them much.

However, the game seems to be more fun and creepier at the beginning.
But afterwards it gets a little repetitive. You fight the same enemies throughout the game.

I wish i didnt spend so much time indoors, and more time outside in the streets.

Sound design is also amazing. Just the sound of walking or climbing or swimming sound so good.
The weapons, especially the shotgun, sound great.
However what this game is missing is a soundtrack. There is no background music to get you pumped up, especially during battle sequences.

One of the best FPS I've played."

Nawt,"Jul 14, 2015",8,"Satisfying gunplay: The Game.

Spooks are not spooky enough anymore (probably because they warn you about them for some reason).
Locations design so uninspired that you always going to be saying to yourself: ""Hey! I've already been in the identical room, like 15 minutes ago.""
Story is completely trivial. And it's good that the game is aware of this, It doesn't try to stop action for a long time.
AI is as good as everyone claimed it to be. They rarely act moronic, they flank, a lot. They ambush when they outnumbered. They won't go to the room when there is clearly someone with shotgun around the corner waiting for them, they act like real people, and this is ironic considering that most of them are mindless clones without any free will, controlled by someone else.
I think the most disappointing part of this game is that there are only two encounters with ninja assassins, they were the best."

sft,"Mar 15, 2015",8,"G.R.E.A.T.

This was a replay for me, having first played FEAR some years ago. I had fond memories of the game and thought it time to revisit it. I’m glad I did. The game has a wonderfully spooky and tense atmosphere and outdoes many more recent titles in this respect (it still startled me on several occasions). The graphics are pretty good given the game’s age. It comes from the era when FPSs were commonly set in research facilities, abandoned factories, and office buildings, and this lack of diversity in the environments is one of the game’s weaknesses. As is the lack of humour -- there are no laughs here. But the game’s strengths lie in the atmosphere and in the combat. There is a palpable sense of apprehension as you sneak along the corridors under the flickering lights. The AI is crafty and the combat is always fun, especially when using the slo-mo, or bullet-time, ability, which is flawlessly implemented. If you like a good old-fashioned FPS with loads of atmosphere and plenty of exhilarating combat you can’t go far wrong with this classic."

Teniendo en cuenta que tiene 10 años de antigüedad las gráficas siguen muy buenas y los efectos de iluminación llaman mucho la atención.

Es entretenido, emocionante y tiene algunas escenas de terror, el juego da sustos pero más acción. La historia es interesante.

Lo malo: no es para jugar más de 1 o 2 horas al día, los escenarios y los enemigos son muy repetitivos, jugar varios niveles (Intervalos) de seguido es repetir una y otra vez la misma temática.

karmasleeper,"Sep 14, 2014",9,"Hands down one of the best FPS games ever made.  Why people call it a horror FPS is beyond me though.  I did not find the game frightening at all aside from a couple jump scares.  Best gun play and attention to detail.  Bullets rip out chunks of dry wall and bullets will spark off certain materials.  This is all magnified by the slow mo ability.  The AI is easily some of the best in an FPS ever.  They will flank you, grenade your position if you stay in one place for too long, and lean around cover just like you can.  Enemy variety is limited but they are tough.  You have standard troopers, big armored suits, and even small mechs that are quite deadly.  Your melee attacks are also very powerful and you can also execute a jump kick and a slide kick.  The story isn't bad and you learn about it through scripted events, voice mail messages, and laptops littered throughout levels.

A couple things I didn't care for.  This is basically a corridor shooter with a more open or varied area from time to time.  Environments mainly consist of industrial areas, office parks, and secret underground labs.  The weapon variety is standard fare until about half way through the game when you start finding way more interesting weapons like the rail gun, the autocannon, and the multirocket launcher.  It's a short game, but it's worth another playthrough or two if you like experiencing different difficulties."

jangers,"May 6, 2014",8,"IMO F.E.A.R. is a very good game, with a great climate and the varied pace of the action. Particularly noteworthy AI opponents and interesting storyline. The downside of the game is to monotony of some levels."
TheUnbeholden,"Apr 22, 2014",9,"The problem with this game in general is that the combat is in such close proximity to the horror elements without ever blurring the lines. It keeps them separate, so when the horror stuff starts you never feel in danger (because theres no combat), and when theres combat you never feel scared (because theres no girl with psychic powers after you).
It's somewhat jarring to go from combat to scary, especially with the lack of tension build up... when you encounter the horror aspects while still in a combat mindset, it underwhelms the experience tenfold.

Horror: 6/10

Story: while it tells the story well through the use of laptops and radio communication, in the end it feels like you haven't learned anything truly interesting. And it leaves quite a few questions unanswered. I felt like there could have been more to it all.

Story: 5/10
Characters: 3/10

But now the good stuff:

AI- the most intelligent AI I've ever encountered, enemies will fire by peeking around corners, circling around to get you, cover fire at you while the other guy moves in closer... throw grenades to flush you out and at the same time never ceasing to give up. They chat to each other like real soldiers would.

Combat- it's dam fun to see sparks fly off bullet holes, and pieces of walls crumble, and dust clouds to build up after enough gun fire.
You take on many squads and even some heavy armor guys with better weaponry. You fire with dual pistols & a spikegun. It makes it easy to switch between which grenade you want and throw it without having to equip it. However there are no real ""bosses"" which means the combat never truly challenges what you've learned.

Level Design- There are some really nice areas like the water purification plant, warehouse areas and then offices, and one sewer part. But then things stay pretty much the same in terms of variety going through samey areas till the end where we get some labs. More outdoors!

Gameplay: 9/10

FEAR gives you a decently long and solid shooter experience. Unfortunately it's hampered by repetitive levels and enemies, but that doesn't create too much of a problem. The game itself is still well worth checking out for shooter fans."
MXMXVRGMS,"Mar 2, 2014",8,"It's 60% action and 40% terror: a classic! F.E.A.R 2 it's 60% terror and 40% action, a classic too! F.E.A.R 3 it's 100% action and 100% disapointment, but it's worth playing..."
g0ing2f4st,"Feb 20, 2014",9,"Amazing game that holds up great over time. The graphics show their age a bit but the overall feel of the game remains. The dark environments, glimpses into the underlying plot and overall suspense keeps you on edge and eager for more. The levels get a bit repetitive but the variety of weapons and challenges helps keep the pace flowing. The horror/suspense bits are well thought out and although they dont often scare, they constantly surprise. They slowdown power is always fun to use and produces some very entertaining results (game physics get a little weird in slow-mo). Overall great experience that I would recommend to almost anybody."
carnivorCactae,"Feb 11, 2014",10,"Playing it, playing it again. and again. and again....
Everything fits perfectly into a cake of delightful gunplay
awesome graphics (still!)!
breathtaking slowmo-effects!
an enemy ai that is still unchallenged up to date!
these damn delicoius particle-effects!
the room for movement! Every fight can differ!

Ah yeah. And there are the ""scary"" parts. In my honest opinion they arent really that scary, cheap jumpcsares aren't shoved permanently in your face and... in my opinion the gunfights are STILL the major pulsside that keep this game still on top of my list. Even this day and age!

Unmatched!
Forget the casualized ""Fear2"" and the even worse cash-in and dumbed down ""F3AR""!
Play this and feel with your sweaty hands why this game is unmatched in its gunplay and slow-mo-feeling!"
ceoshot,"Dec 22, 2013",10,One of the few shooter games that has the cool slow motion. Good story. They really did a good job when they put this game together. It is like one of those old movies that you just wont to keep coming back too & watch over & over.
fittuner,"Dec 22, 2013",8,"F.E.A.R. is a blast to play.  Unlike many first-person shooters, your bullets feel like they do actual damage and you can feel the shredding of your enemies before you.  Your quick reflex (slow-mo) ability and varying melee attacks add a hint of John Woo flavoring to the mix.  Also, being a game that uses the word ""fear"" as an acronym(First Espionage Assault Recon), it has a bit of horror in it and acts as an accessible game for people looking to dip their toes in the horror genre of gaming but don't feel they're quite ready for the more hardcore panic attack-inducing games out there. The only big issue I had with F.E.A.R. was how disappointingly short it is.  I was expecting at least ten hours of great gameplay, but instead, I burned through the game in six or seven hours.  While the game itself is great, the length keeps it from scoring higher in my book.  All in all, F.E.A.R. is a great game even if it is a little short."
squidgee,"Dec 11, 2013",8,"A great game for its time. The visuals are excellent as is the sound design, just going into slow-mo and seeing bullets whiz by is fantastic. The story isn't anything outstanding, but it's solid and it works. Gunplay is fairly conventional, but enhanced with the addition of slow-mo. One thing that really stands out in this game though is the AI. It is simply excellent, no other shooter I've played has surpassed it, even shooters released years after it's release. It means enemies feel like more than just cardboard characters that just hide behind cover and shoot every now and then. Expect to be flushed out, ambushed and flanked if you don't pay attention. Perhaps the game is a bit repetitive in its gameplay and level design, though it does try to spruce it up a bit with new weapons and new enemies. Scares could've been better as well. Sometimes it feels as if jumpscares are just shoved down your throat, and I would've appreciated some buildup of tension in some levels before the actual scare, it would've created a more intimidating atmosphere. Fighting assassins was truly intense though. Overall, a game definitely worth consideration for FPS and horror fans."
BlasterS33,"Nov 25, 2013",10,"One of the best games out there in the FPS genre. It's a fast-action game that will make you look at every corner, waiting to be ambushed by enemies. The story is fantastic, the first game of this epic trilogy that is F.E.A.R."
chall112304,"Nov 22, 2013",10,"I think the game is awesome, I had it when it first came out and just repurchased it. It still has great graphics and a good storyline. And it will make you jump a few times too."

This is a guideline for how to properly review games. Many reviewers like to get a “feel” for a game, and arbitrarily give a game a score that they believe it deserves. This results in wildly different scores between different reviewers, and vastly different scores between similar games. This guideline addresses these problems and scores games fairly and consistently. This guideline also gives scores that are usually similar to the metacritic score.

The review score is based out of 10 points. There are no “half” or 0.5 increments. It is impossible to have a score above 10 or below 0. The review score will change as the game gets new dlc, drops in price, or if more secrets are found through the game increasing its appeal.

The scoring is split into 6 sections. The first five sections can add a possible 2 points to the final score. The first 5 sections are Single Player/Multi Player, Gameplay, Visuals/Story, Accessibility/Longevity, and Pricing.

Notice that 3 of these sections have two parts. These particular sections will be scored based on the stronger part of the game of the two. For example, **** has a lousy single player campaign, but an excellent multiplayer component, that section will be based solely on the multiplayer as if the single player did not exist. This allows games to be based on their own merits, as many unnecessary features are shoehorned into video games by publishers to reach a “feature quota”. Games that excel in both areas of a section don’t receive should be noted in the written review, but cannot increase the score past 2 in that section. However, it can be taken into account in the final section

The final section can add 1, add 0, or subtract 1 to the final score. This final section is the “wildcard” section. This section is for how the reviewer “feels” about the game, but limits this only to this section, rather than the entire 10 point review. This section can include any positive or negative point that was not covered in the previous 5 sections."

F.E.A.R is excellent all the way through, and is injected with some bullet time to help you keep going. Horror-wise, it isn't that scary. It's basically jumpscare after jumpscare, and it can sometimes be effective, but it usually isn't. Buy it for the shooting. If I could give this game more than 10, I would."

Jimmy_D,"Nov 11, 2013",7,"It's got insanely good gunplay and particle effects, but also very repetitive, square level design, and pacing that only really works for short bursts, otherwise it becomes rather tedious. The AI is nothing special, but I've mostly played Halo and Half life games in FPS terms, so maybe I'm just used to smarter foes. The plot is also pretty **** but who really cares. It's a 7.5 for me but Metacritic only allows 1 to 10 ranking so I just flipped a coin and gave it a 7."

Lucif3r,"Oct 22, 2013",8,"Have the retail version since 2005. It is a very good shooter. With some of the best A.I and gameplay. Engine feels very solid. Visuals were also breathtaking, It literally felt like firing from an actual gun, when sparks and dust came out. I know it is supposed to be an corridor shooter and close combat action game but the environments lacked of variation. 8.5/10"
parpabico,"Aug 31, 2013",7,"Cool game from the heyday of slo-mo and ""HDR lighting"". Gameplay is a tad boring at times, since there's only like less then 5 types of enemies. Story is a bit crude and cruel, but then it's a horror game. Good graphics and fun enemy AI  probably the best use of slo-mo to day (and for a long time to come with the fad falling out of favor with the devs and users alike years ago)."
thefreeman140,"Aug 30, 2013",10,"F.E.A.R. definitely takes it place up there with all the other shooter classics (Half-Life 2, Bioshock, System Shock 2, etc.). The action is smooth and fun, and the story is phenomenal. It's not too scary, but I don't think it was meant to be that scary. In conclusion F.E.A.R. is hands down one of the best FPS experiences you can get on PC."
Ruston,"Aug 30, 2013",10,"If you need some action, just play F.E.A.R. Game is fantastic. Atmosphere, good AI, soundtrack, graphic and many more. That's why you should play this game. It's in my TOP 5 shooter games and I don't see any new game which can beat F.E.A.R. and Alma Wade"
Tempestangel,"Jul 27, 2013",8,"F.E.A.R. Is an all around good game, with an intriguing plot full of twists turns that wind your mind up and leave you wondering, almost even disturbed.

The game does not abuse ""Jump Scare tactics"" as many other games of the genre do, and instead uses it when it can truly leave an impact on you.

F.E.A.R. has some unique game play, which is pretty good for the time of the games release, featuring a ""Slow-mo system"" but overall feels very under-polished, enemies are able to dominate you with ease at times only because you are not given a form of true cover, it can leave you hanging at times, as sometimes the flee or fight thing can be very one sided (You are pushed into the danger head on)"
Le_Shorte,"Jun 14, 2013",9,"I can't actually think of any flaws for this game, besides the graphics and boring environments, but this is 2013. I don't expect an 8-year-old game to retroactively gain amazing graphics. It's definitely scary sometimes, and the level design is AMAZING. The gameplay is great and has the best AI I've ever seen in a shooter. The environments are extremely samey, as well. Overall, a great game, one of the best FPSs of all time."
htimreimer,"May 15, 2013",5,"Fear Is so bland,boring and not vary scary. 90% of the scares are just cheap and lazy jump scares and the gameplay is bland and boring. i think the slow motion thing was supposed to be the thing that separates itself from the fps pack but it gets old quickly and dosent improve the overall quality of the gameplay. overall its a vary mediocre fps with a decent story and atmosphere"
drakenseng,"Feb 12, 2013",8,"the story involves you, a recent recruit in a military crew. you at first investigate strange things happening to your crew members. the story then gets more in depth later on. the gameplay controls are great for 1st person shooters. its a horror game and a shooter and it did an outstanding job. the way they use sound was great, and the visual effects with the dark shadows and shading made it a fun experience. one of the better horror first person shooters to be released in some time. i believe the second one is really better in terms of gameplay. but this one had lots more scary moments."
golfandcars2,"Jan 23, 2013",8,"Fear is a great one time play-through game.  The suspense during missions is very high and the sounds and animations keep the player on the edge of their seat.  The weapons are all very different and useful, The AI enemy is about the most enjoyable to play against, as in they were difficult enough in which any one guy could take you out if you were not paying attention.  The layout of the maps are perfect for this type of game, old hotels, factories, etc.  The game overall is a rush, however, by the last couple of missions, I was honestly burnt out; I couldn't wait to finish.  Overall, great FPS shooter, and great one-time play.  Oh and the plot is well done also."
vahn,"Jan 4, 2013",8,"Never had a chance to play it, but always heard of it. Finally got it on discount and installed right away, and few hours later I was able to play it. The result...well it was a good game but it definitely needed some variety. And I do mean it. F.E.A.R is basically a story driven shooter with some horror elements that actually do work at times and actually scares you enough to keep going and see what's going on. With that said, there's just not enough variety in the action, weapons, levels and also enemies. For starters, the game gives you the possibility to slow time in order to, like the game says, ""to pass through challenging parts"", which is definitely a great addition, but just overused like crazy because, in short, you'll never, ever, ever, ever engage the enemies without it: the enemies are too strong. I have played at normal but yet the enemies, especially if it's crowded, they can easily eliminate you, also thanks to their amazing AI, which is extremely precise and will help you give a challenge. Just too bad that with the slowmo, the game is a joke and even a player like me who really fails at shooters was able to finish it without dying that much. Also, the weapons in game are too few. You can use only 3 weapons at a time and...this isn't a huge limit because the weapons in game are VERY few, and only 3 types of grenades. On top of that, a lot of weapons don't have ammunition right away so you'll end up either switching for a more common weapon, or just use one for the entire game. The nice thing here however is that you can save your medikits and that really helps a LOT, since you can have up to 10 medikits, although they are rather common. Also you will be able to upgrade your health and focus using some enhancers, which they are scattered all over the level, in which gives you a decent reason to explore properly. Speaking of levels, the game is...very limited as well. Even though the game is very linear, the problem is that you will hardly interact with the enviroment: you cannot move crates, you cannot move anything, you can't even jump over some windows if the game doesn't plan to, but this isn't a very old game and for that reason I'd expect a little more interaction (and variety). Ah, the flashlight is very weak: should light a lot more, and shouldn't have a charge, since that 90% of the game is set in the dark. And for last, but not the least (since you literally get it at the start), the enemies....There is literally one enemy in the entire game (the so called ""Replica Soldiers""), and sometimes the enemy will throw to you other variation of those, and sometimes you get ""normal"" policemen. There is also another type of soldier, a super fast one, the heavy armor ones, mecha-drivers, and another type at the end of the **** that's it. I probably didn't forget others, but even if I did the enemies are just too few! They are great in actions, but In the end I get too tired of fighting the same soldier cloned to death. On the other hand...I liked the story. It pratically disappears during the middle act, but the start and the end, especially the end, it's great and makes the effort all worth it. There aren't alot of twists and such in the end, but those few twists are very good, but doesn't really make the game worth alone. But it's still a good game to boot though: the setting is rather tense and the game does scare you at times with some well thought scares; the fightings, even if not varied, is fun and gives a good challenge, especially since everyone enjoys to be a super soldier once in a while. I guess the main flaw here is the lack of variety, but if you can pass it, you'll get a good shooter in your hands. Not great, just good."
sn00ze,"Jan 3, 2013",9,"This is how scary and high octane action game should look like. And for those saying the story is non-existent or too linear, I guess you weren't paying much of an attention to all those phone messages and research from laptops. 9/10"
suneater,"Jan 3, 2013",7,"A fantastic twist on the horror genre with amazing (for their time) graphics, enemy AI that work together in groups against you, a story that you feel compelled to piece together through exploration, and explosive combat with amazing sound design and environmental decay. Starts off great, lulls in the middle for a while going through the normal FPS motions and then pulls out all the stops for the last few levels with a finale to remember. Highly recommended for FPS and horror fans alike; just don't go into this expecting a first person Resident Evil because it's no ""survival horror."""
Phuzer,"Dec 27, 2012",5,"F.E.A.R is a pretty fun game but it has not aged well at all in my opinion, don't get me wrong the graphics are fine but the levels are too repetitive and so are the enemies that you see. I actually found it hard to sit down for a long period of time to play it, I was never really interested, the lack of story does not help. That being said the last hour of the game actually freaked me out and made me want to check the second one out to see what it's all about. If you want to get involved in the series to try the new games go ahead and play this, if not it really is not worth your time."
Accelerator-kun,"Dec 25, 2012",10,"This game is the Half-Life of the Horror shooters genre. Who says that the story is bad clearly hasn't understood it, because it's a deep, mature, disturbing and dramatic story, talking of experiments on human beings which return to avenge their past. Also, this is one of the few games that made jump more than one time. You will feel scared a lot of times. Also, the enemies are strong and with a great AI... the won't go down easyly. The arsenal is not very large, but is various, starting with normal guns and finishing with sci-fi guns like plasma cannons. All guns are funny to use. This game features also a bullet-time mode (""Slow-Mo"") that you can active to make the firefights easier... you'll really need it. This is ine of the best first person shooter that I ever played... at least one of the scarier and with the best story. Recommended. Highly recommended."
Vilyn117,"Dec 14, 2012",10,"This game is fantastic now, even ,more so for it's time back in the day. If you havent played it yet, it cant hurt to give it a whirl! The graphics are tolerable and the ambient noises and sound effects in general, plus very solid gunplay and smart AI (their tactics surprised me) are fantastic. Don't regret a thing, in 2012."
fedak,"Nov 23, 2012",7,F.E.A.R as a FPS was solid but somewhat dated.  The AI was quite good (I played on hard) with enemies that would routinely flank you.  The level design was somewhat drab and repetitive and the weaponry was fairly cliched FPS fare.   The combat centers heavily on the use of bullet time- which was innovative back in
birdman3,"Nov 13, 2012",4,"The story line nearly doesn't exist- it isn't told in any kind of logical fashion, and it makes no sense. The graphics are great, and the ability to slow time is useful at first, but eventually you develop a dependence upon it that becomes a crutch. Enemies do so much damage that you can't risk going into battle without it, but then it makes the game too easy. The weapons are very limited- you either have a machine gun, a rifle, or dual pistols. There are no other legitimate options. The game is scary at first, but after about the third level, the whole shock factor is depleted. I would not recommend this game to anyone- even if you can buy it cheap, you're better off re-playing any of the other FPS's you have in your library. Play ANY one of them."
battletoaster,"Sep 26, 2012",8,"Great psychological horror mixed in with exciting action sequences.  The story is pretty compelling too.   Although I can't give it a 10 because while the graphics/design are nice, it does seem like you're playing one level for most of the game."
spraycan74,"Aug 9, 2012",10,"A classic video game that succeeds at giving you a dead, tense feeling inside. The game delivers exactly what it's supposed to, giving a repetitive, tedious gameplay experience that dives deep into your mind, invading all of your senses while making you drown in the dread of the story. Each skirmish is brought out in a fearful manor, making you watch out intensely each time you go into a door.......... This game knows how to control you......... Buy this game today."
potatoes351,"Jul 31, 2012",8,"F.E.A.R is one of the best FPS's in years. The gunplay is what sells the game plus its generous length. The graphics and story are not though. Its scares fall flat on its face all the time, however the enemy AI are stupidly smart which give the game a great challenge. A great FPS that all shooter fans should play."
GeorgeA,"Jul 18, 2012",8,"F.E.A.R. still holds pretty well even today. For a seven-year old game that isn't a small achievement. The core of the game-the gunfights, are great thanks to well-paced slow-mo, excellent animations and furthermore  enemies, who actually provide some real challenge as they are actually fighting to WIN the battle and not to reduce your health bar. All because of probably the best combat AI seen in FPS. Unfortunately, the level design is too ascetic, too bland and that's probably the biggest problem the game has along with being somewhat repetitive. I closed my eyes to all of these, but I can understand those, who can't.  Actually, It's not hard to guess why developers deliberately  went with that kind of level design . Cinematic gunfights are far better suited to offices, labs, warehouses, other closed urban environments and not large open areas, like per say, fields as the game would have lost it's cinematic flare it's famous for. As for other  aspects, graphics were cutting edge for their time, while today they aren't particularly impressive, except for model animations and effects. There is satisfying level of detail, but the color palette is too poor, too grey. The story starts well, but becomes  predictable in the end, tries to be Japanese-scare-you-with-a little-girl-horror type(which doesn't really work), while it could have been much more thanks detailed backstory. The game didn't scare me as much as it aroused interest to explore the game's universe. It so sad, that such  promising series degenerated into another modern Call of Duty like shooter with the release of mediocre sequel and terrible third game. I really hope, Monolith (or any talented studio for that matter) will revive the series. It deserves better than this."

Sarthael,"Jun 4, 2012",10,"A slow, morbid and clever storyline, tense and nervous firefights, a very good balance among weapons, amazing music and sounds, the smartest AI you can find in a FPS. The action part is perfect, the horror part is perfect and the balance between both is perfect. A masterpiece."
wololooo,"Mar 19, 2012",9,"I recently revisited F.E.A.R. for the first time in five years, and to say it's aged well would be a huge understatement. F.E.A.R. is truly creepy - there's very little of the unexpected scares (monsters jumping out at you etc.) that most horror games are filled with, and instead the game relies on the slow buildup of an incredibly tense atmosphere through cutaway flashes and gruesome visuals.
All the weapons (especially the combat shotgun) feel powerful and really pack a punch. Unlike most FPS games I found myself reguarly switching between different guns, rather than sticking to the same three the whole game. The slomo bullet-time feature, despite being done before, was a great addition and added to the tactical gameplay. Using it to blast off your enemies limbs and heads never got old. The AI is really impressive, with soldiers really working together to outflank you or flush you out of cover with grenades.  It's true that the levels are somewhat repetitive, but I like how Monolith have payed homage to classic shooters like DOOM and Half-Life in their semi-linear interior layouts; offering the choice to follow the main hallways and storm through the levels, or take the time to explore and be rewarded with medkits, ammo and intriguing voicemail. F.E.A.R. is a huge achievement for Monolith, and despite the lacklustre sequels it will long be known as one of their greatest triumphs."
CaptainMushroom,"Feb 8, 2012",9,"Hands down, best horror game ever. And yes, I have played Amnesia. The incredible A.I, buckets full of blood, paranormal events and that creepy feeling you get when you walk around a corner .. hands down best horror game ever and best game in the F.E.A.R. series.

Liquidlizard,"Dec 23, 2011",10,Must-have for people who like horror kind of stuff because it is the scariest game I ever did play. Very fun indeed and there is only one problem; I'm gonna have nightmares for weeks.
Doomboss,"Dec 22, 2011",10,"I played all F.E.A.R. games and it really scary even now. I remember that i first played it when i was in middle school, and it was sooooooo horrific and scary!! The atmosphere in this game is awesome, which created a very scary environment. Some people might complain about the graphic but this game is actually a 2005 game, so what kind of graphic are you expecting? Compare to some other game that came out in the same year, F.E.A.R. is actually not bad!! But one thing sad is the multiplayer no longer available..."
Matseb2611,"Dec 20, 2011",4,"To be very honest, I was quite disappointed. I was actually really hoping to like this game, and I did enjoy it a lot in the first couple of hours or so. But after that I realised that there was nothing more to this game but mindless repetitive shooting. Let me explain. First the good bits. F.E.A.R. has some distinct strength, no doubt. It has very nice and realistic use of lighting and shadows, and also a very clever enemy AI, so enemies actually use teamwork and take cover instead of just running at you. The ability to go into bullet time (slow motion) is also very nice, but that ability is pretty much the leverage point of the entire game. You aren't encouraged to use it, you are forced to use it. If you don't, you die too easily. This makes every single gunfight a mindlessly slow drudgery. You are also given cool melee attacks, but you can be sure you won't use them past the first level, because you almost never get a chance to get that close to the enemy. Action in general - as I said, it's fun for the first couple of hours, but then you realise that every single gunfight is virtually the same as the hundred you've had before. The same types of enemies, the same types of arenas, the same types of guns. Nothing changes! This is boring! And speaking of boring... the levels. I have played more than half of the game, which is quite a number of hours, and I've only encountered 3 types of areas  throughout - sewers, warehouses and offices. That's it. It's the same kind of areas repeating themselves all the time. And there are even several parts of the game where you walk corridor after corridor with nothing happening whatsoever. No enemies and no suspense, just corridors. That heavily detracts from the pace of the game. As for the horror element. Well, it sort of works at first, but after first few levels you realise that none of those ""scares"" actually have any effect on you. They are just images. In games like Doom 3 for example, things that jump at you out of nowhere are actual monsters that can KILL you. In F.E.A.R. nothing that jumps at you can affect you in any bad way. It's totally harmless, so why get scared about it? By all means, F.E.A.R. is a well-made game, I have not encountered any bugs and such, but it's not entertaining at all. It doesn't have interesting puzzles, no story to encourage you to play on. It's just a repetitive shoot em up."

sdel96,"Nov 28, 2011",2,"I picked up F.E.A.R cheap on Steam, as you do, expecting an engaging and enjoyable horror shooter. What I got was something different entirely. After the second level it becomes a drag of just more of the same. Bland, grey rooms, leading into bland, grey rooms. Hey, if you were lucky you might get one with a blood splatter in it, but that was the extent of it. The graphics were nothing special, even running on the highest setting and the gameplay just awful. It eventually became and endless cycle of 'slow-mo on - shoot the crap out of everything - slow-mo off.' Rinse and repeat. A horror experience absent of horror or atmosphere, and this is coming from someone who can barely sit through a horror flick. A thoughtless ending was the climax of a story desperately crying out for some more detail and attention. Save your money, seriously."
LordMandalore,"Nov 23, 2011",9,"This game is more like a John Woo film with the Grudge thrown in. It is without a doubt one of the funnest fps games I have ever played, probably because the enemy AI is the best I have ever played against, even 6 years later. The story is also interesting, and there are a few great scares, but it DOES get repetitive around the middle levels."
mASTERbLASTER1,"Nov 19, 2011",10,"In 2005 when this came out, it blew away every game in terms of graphics realism, oustanding enemy ai, and solid care gameplay action. It was sometimes repetitive in it's corridor shooter focus, but its strong points made up for it for the most part."

There are some moments where you go WTF, but that's 'some' moments; it doesn't happen very often. However, what also keeps ""F.E.A.R"" from becoming a great game is the repetitive monotonous levels that create a dejavu of ""I played this kind of map before..."". You want some old fashioned fun? Then grab this game. You want some epic **** Get something alse."
Mire7734,"Sep 29, 2011",10,"A horror fps, with very clever scare tactics. Not like your run of the mill horror style shooter, the tension really builds up as you go along, and once you find out the true story of the games, leave you even more shocked. A must play for any fans of fps/psychological horror games."
intelligence,"Sep 21, 2011",10,"so realistic game. and the subject is such original. weapons, environments and game play are fantastic. maybe the game would be more long. my point is 11/10."
Sidewayz,"Aug 30, 2011",8,"Definitely a genuine tried and true FPS, but at the same time, a very emotive one.  I really enjoyed playing this... enough to subsequently replay it twice.  One aspect that I particularly liked was the labyrinthine level design.  The FPS element is also nicely executed.  Overall, a very dark and well executed title."
oblivion2011,"Jul 3, 2011",7,This is one of the few games that really scared the pants off of me the 1st time through. Really does keep your blood pressure high (figure of speech). The game mechanics feel too basic compared to other games and feels like not much work has been put into it.
kingzardoz,"Jun 26, 2011",10,"According to these user reviews FEAR seems to be a love or hate experience. People junk this game for repetitive levels, bad graphics, and lack of enemy diversity. I just don't see any of that except maybe the bad level complaint is valid. Although who cares about how the levels look when the gameplay is so solid. I just played this game again in 2011 and it's still an awesome game. My one complaint with this game is even on the hardest difficulty it is still a bit too easy. The reason people love or hate this game is because its focus is the same gameplay over and over in different variations so if you don't like the shooting mechanic you will pretty much hate the whole game. Monolith has an epic resume of games"
The_Ommadawn,"Jun 18, 2011",9,"I grabbed F.E.A.R during the Steam 50% deal (17th June 2011).  Having never played any of the FEAR games and not really a FPS fan, I only bought them because they were cheap.  This game really surprised me.  Graphically it's pretty good and plays at a rock solid 60FPS.  The story is interesting and the horror element is well done (lights going out, doors slamming, etc).  For me, It's the gun battles and the AI that sell FEAR.  Having played many FPS over the years I don't recall any with such clever enemies.  If you encounter a group of 4 soldiers and take aim, you fire your weapon they spread out and look for cover.  One will fire back while the other 3 will try to outwit you by flanking, throwing a grenade, moving up high, etc.  Having never fired a rifle or been in a fire fight, FEAR puts on screen how I would imagine a REAL gun battle would be.  You cannot charge in and expect to come out untouched.  You have to look for cover and pick each target off one by one while they in turn do the same.  The gun sounds are convincing and just about everything you see can be shot at leaving trails of dust, wall tiles, broken boxes and spent extinguishers.  FEAR is tons of fun.  If you're looking for a great action FPS you can't go wrong with FEAR."
JonesR,"Jun 17, 2011",10,"Has to be one of the best first person horror shooters ever made. Before F.E.A.R., there was very little to choose from in the action horror genre. Monolith Timegate really did a great job in putting together a quality game that will give you chills. It reminds me of those horror movies like The Ring and The Grudge. It provides the right complement of shooting action combined with well placed cut scenes. Many of the enemies are quite unique and offer some serious challenge on the higher difficulty settings. The slow motion feature does make the game a little easy, but you can deliberately not use it. The ideal way to experience this game is to create a scare factor atmosphere by playing it at night with the lights turned off. Highly recommended if you've never played it."
theshonen8899,"May 14, 2011",9,"FEAR is one of my personal favorites because it gets a lot of things right for me. The atmosphere, scares, and intriguing story really sets FEAR out to be a creative title. The variety of weapons are fantastic and fun though the environments may become repetitive. Slowly discovering the truth behind Alma and Fettel's past is extremely interesting and the end will leave you very satisfied. Overall a great shooter that every PC gamer should try out!"
Roeyl,"May 1, 2011",7,"Nicely scary. The intrigue is well exploited and starts with a nice mysterious intro. Although the slowmo ability gives an interesting gameplay as well as some karate moves (which you rarely use), the gameplay itself is flat and very repetitive. Graphics are okay and graphic designs are so-so."
spartan-117,"Oct 2, 2010",9,The game is scary.Scary as **** not the scary type you will find in doom 3.A much much more scary **** japanese kind of fear **** one which really disturbes **** you will be scared.I felt chills cod as ice on the back when i saw Alma first **** game is full of **** shooting is **** weapons are ok.Even the soldiers scared me sometimes.Good.
