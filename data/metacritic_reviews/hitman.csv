Brandon7978,"Jun 11, 2024",9,"Hitman 3, the latest installment in IO Interactive's acclaimed series, masterfully refines the stealth mechanics that have defined the franchise while introducing new layers of depth and replayability. This game sets a new standard for the stealth genre, offering players a sophisticated and immersive experience that is both challenging and rewarding. 

Stealth Mechanics: A Perfect ExecutionAt the heart of Hitman 3 lies its unparalleled stealth gameplay. The game meticulously balances accessibility with complexity, ensuring that both newcomers and veterans of the series find something to love.

 The intuitive controls and refined AI make for a deeply engaging experience. Enemies react realistically to your actions, heightening the tension and satisfaction of each successful infiltration.

Agent 47's arsenal of gadgets and disguises allows for a myriad of approaches to each mission. Whether you're blending in as a waiter to poison a target's drink or setting up a remote-controlled explosive to create a ""happy accident,"" the possibilities are nearly limitless. The level design further enhances these mechanics, with sprawling, intricately detailed environments that are ripe for exploration and experimentation.

Endless Possibilities one of Hitman 3's greatest strengths is its replayability. Each level is a sandbox filled with countless opportunities and secrets waiting to be uncovered. The game encourages players to replay missions multiple times, offering different starting locations, disguises, and mission objectives that drastically alter the gameplay experience. This not only extends the game's longevity but also ensures that no two playthroughs are the **** ""Escalation Contracts"" add another layer of challenge and variety, progressively increasing in difficulty and complexity. 

Additionally, the ""Contracts Mode"" allows players to create and share their own custom missions, fostering a vibrant community and providing an endless stream of new content. 

For those seeking even more challenges, the ""Elusive Targets"" present time-limited missions that test your skills under high pressure, adding a thrilling edge to the game.

In conclusion, Hitman 3 is a masterclass in stealth game design, offering a richly detailed world, sophisticated mechanics, and an astonishing level of replayability. The game's ability to provide a fresh and engaging experience with each playthrough is a testament to IO Interactive's craftsmanship. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series or a newcomer looking for an engrossing stealth adventure, Hitman 3 is an essential addition to your gaming library. With its perfect blend of innovation and refinement, Hitman 3 earns a well-deserved 9 out of 10."

styrgianfoe,"Feb 27, 2024",7,"The current World of Assassination package always contains Hitman 1 (2016) and this is about the Hitman 3 DLC package. The levels might have the best settings of the trilogy, but they are scaled down from the (almost too) grandiose levels of Hitman 2 and thus lacking in replay value.  Some **** level plots felt unfinished, some levels felt great on the first playthrough and then lacking in subsequent ones, Mendoza's first impression stuns you for hours until you get to  the second target where the Villa is little more than a shack, and the finale level is 1/10 garbage. Ambrose island was reusing assets, but fell flat on its face in the gameplay department. This is okay for one run, but nothing of the epicness of Hitman 2's Mumbai."

exclulsive,"Jan 31, 2024",9,"The best of the trilogy. Hitman 3 is an almost perfect game that improves upon the last two games. A game that will give you a real hitman experience with its unique looking and beautifully crafted maps. You can literally have fun by doing nothing and just wandering around the map. It has a great story that makes you think about how the story will take shape after each mission. The replayability part gains its true meaning with this game. Definitely one of the best stealth games ever, in my opinion. There's nothing more to say, this game is definitely a MUST PLAY, so go ahead."
Pumpkinpunker,"Jan 29, 2024",9,"I had a lot of fun with this game. You will not find this type of social stealth anywhere else. Agent 47 is a master of disguise and sabotage. Each mission has its own unique feel with a multitude of ways to get the job done. Locations are essentially stealth sandboxes. It's a lot more than just crouch walking, knocking out targets, and hiding bodies."

PREFACE:
The final game of the long-established stealth game series, as well as the final trilogy, the reboot. In 2016, the series was rebooted under the name Hitman. In 2018, Hitman 2 came with almost exactly the same mechanics and visuals, and in 2021, this reboot made its final with Hitman 3. You can think of these 3 games as seasons of the series. Visually and mechanically the same games. Currently, 3 games are sold in a single package under the name World of Assassination.

STORY:
Our main character is agent 47, an experienced assassin. In this game, we can see that agent 47 is a truly experienced and master assassin. Some chapters touched upon this situation very well. But there's nothing well-crafted about Agent 47's personality. Classic is the same as previous games. There is neither an intriguing plot nor the characters written well. The side characters were not handled well. There are 6 main story chapters in the game, and they all last approximately 1 hour. So, like the previous 2 games, it contains a short story of 5-6 hours. I can't say that the game is a game that should be played for its story. There is a structure in which the story is used as a tool rather than a goal. You don't care about the story until the last 2 episodes anyway. It cannot be said that he is very good at presentation either. The story is told with cinematics at the beginning and end of the episode.

GAMEPLAY:
Let's come to the gameplay side, this is the most diverse and important point of the game. The main story of the game can be easily finished in 5 hours. But everyone can do this in different ways. If you want, you can play with everyone. If you want, you can progress by secretly killing them with your silencer, or you can finish off your targets by poisoning them. There are different ways like these. It is possible to kill targets in different ways from different places. By using many disguises and listening to the conversations of some NPCs, you can get in close to your target and kill them. Personally, I preferred to disguise myself and play secretly with my Silencer. On the gameplay side, its only mechanical rival seems to be MGS 5. But it is also a game with a more linear structure compared to MGS 5. It has not very big but layered areas. A single building often has many different locations. Thanks to this, the level designs have become much better. In my opinion, level designs are the most critical factor in stealth games. This is what makes Hitman 3 clearly superior to the 1st and 2nd games. They've really gone to the top in terms of level designs.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE:
Artificial intelligence is again one of the most important aspects in stealth games. For example, in MGS 5, the artificial intelligence was amazing and this pushed you to different tactics. There is no such artificial intelligence in Hitman 3, but they are not brainless either. When you enter the enemy's line of sight, a short-term bar appears and if you run away before that time expires, you will not be caught, but they will search the area you appear in for a short time. Some enemy NPCs have a white dot on them, which means they know they are your enemies. When you change your disguise, that white spot can disappear.

GRAPHİCS and OPTIMIZATION:
I can say that it is very good in terms of graphics and optimization, especially when we look at the games that have been released recently. It is a very good game in terms of optimization and graphics. I remember getting around 150 FPS in the game with the RX 6700 XT. According to the tests, stable 60 FPS can be achieved with 1060 and Ultra. This is a really good value for a game that looks good released in 2021. But the game's RT optimization is extremely bad. When I turned on RT, my FPS value, which was 140-150, dropped to around 30-50 and I did not notice any visual difference. I do not recommend using RT in the game.

LAST WORD:
I think the game is the best game of the stealth genre right now. ""Can I buy it?"" If you ask, it is 197 TL in Microsoft Store. It can be used on PC. It also includes the 1st and 2nd games, so I think it's a pretty good price. If you like the stealth genre and have played and liked the previous Hitman games, I highly recommend it. If you don't like the previous games or the genre, you won't like this either. If you want to get into the genre or series, the first part of the game can be played for free under the name ""free starter pack"". You can play it and see if you like it. By the way, the game is also available on Game Pass. Those who have Game Pass or those who want to play games other than Game Pass can also play from there. In short, Hitman 3 is not a masterpiece, but it is a quality game that does what it does well.

SCORE: 85/100"

Zski,"Oct 1, 2023",8,"I am a long time fan of the series, all the way since Hitman 2 on GameCube. I played all three games of the new trilogy, and while I very much enjoyed them, the value of it was questionable. With Hitman 3 converting into Hitman World of Assassination by merging all of the maps from all three games and adding the new Freelancer mode as well as other additions, this is a MASSIVE value. The amount of maps that you receive is fantastic, especially with you getting the variety from all three games, so none of them feel like a waste. For example, the intro levels from Hitman 1 and Hitman 2 were very small and felt like a wasted map in each individual game, but now with access to all of the maps, the change of speed of going from small maps to large maps adds awesome variety. The Freelancer mode isn’t perfect, there are a few bugs, but it adds a nice coat of paint to maps you’re already familiar with and encourages/forces you to explore new areas and look at levels differently. Definitely adds more content to a game already bursting at the seams with content. One critique is the extremely confusing DLC catalogue, it’s hard to tell what you get with each package, and I believe that might be by design.

Regarding the game itself, the maps are fantastic. They feel more alive than any of the previous games, and it is really starting to feel like an actualized vision that the earlier Hitman games tried to create. Some of the maps are absolutely brilliant, specifically the race in Miami, the level in suburbia, and the “who did it” style mystery mansion. Mix those fresh takes on Hitman with some extremely well executed hugely populated levels and more traditional Hitman espionage levels - this game has it all. The amount of detail and the stories that develop in each level makes it feel to just get lost in them exploring around. I like how one tip you overhear takes you into another direction, then you cross paths with your secondary target, so you change your game plan again. It’s great. With that said, the jank that we have learned to embrace in previous Hitman games is still here - the sometimes overly scripted AI, the NPCs that feel like a living crowd but completely soulless individuals, the randomness of the AI that bounces between brick stupid and ignoring you killing someone right in front of them to being super sleuth investigators that will investigate all the right places at the right times, etc. It’s not perfect, but it’s absolutely the best attempt at the classic Hitman formula, though nowhere near revolutionary. Fans of the series will be extremely satisfied.

The graphics are excellent, especially in the amount of detail in the maps, although it looks a lot less polished in other areas, such as the character designs. The sound design is great, although the thriller movie background music on loop gets a little old. The story is somewhere between a great overarching theme to uninspired. It adds a cool theme of feeling like you’re influencing what the global elite are doing to the world, and then it progressively narrows down to a cool look at Agent 47’s backstory, but there are so many cutscenes that are loaded with random characters that I don’t care about. I appreciate it for giving you the feeling that you’re just an assassin infiltrating the global elite, but at the end of the day, it’s good enough but still forgettable.

Excellent game which will be a huge hit for fans, and an approachable experience for newcomers. Hitman World of Assassination is an incredible value."

Reflections have never looked better. Pure quality."
PhoenixT,"Feb 7, 2023",3,"What could be a great game ruined by ridiculous quirks that should be long gone by now.

Very much a long time fan, a beautiful game, but, for the love of god there are some things that are so unforgiveable.

The settings are amazing, so much detail, hidden little pieces all over the place.

The story is brilliant, played out over 1, 2 and now 3 explaining, who 47 is, brilliant and I never saw some of it coming.

The characters are fully fleshed out and the hits, brilliantly executed, BUT.....

The AI, ye gods, when will IOI listen to what the players have been saying?, it's just so shonky, it's not funny. NPC's that see you through the tiniest of cracks, through solid walls, hear ""silent"" take downs and investigate simply ""because"", or spot you with no reflective surfaces while with their backs to you. This isn't as if this is something new either, players have been reporting for YEARS how bad the AI is on the NPC's and IOI have done exactly nothing.

And now we have Freelancer mode. WTAF!!!

Put all those bugs into an unforgiving layout, then jack the bugs up to 11. It's not even funny. You get halfway or three quarters of the way through a syndicate campaign, kill the target, and because there are decoys, they take the decoys to an exit, there is NO indication they are a threat to you, you try to exit, and they kill you, no warning, just dead and that's hours of work ruined because, if you die the campaign is reset and IOI are too lazy or too stupid, take your pick, to do their job properly.

A great game ruined by slap dash programming.

I had given a rating of 5, now dropped to 3. On Freelancer mode, if you die in normal mission you lose that map, take a hit on your money and lose your tools and weapons you took with you but not those you had at the safe house.

If you get killed on a ""Leader"" mission you loose ALL tools even at the safe house, financial hit, keep the weapons at the safe house, and the campaign is reset to the start.

Just killed on a regular mission, yet due to IOI's slap dash rush to use Freelancer mode to get more money, and releasing the update before it was ready, I got killed on a regular mission on the final level but got reset as if it were a Leader mission.

I'd call IOI incompetent, but they don't even rate that well. They've become another Dev more interested in milking their game for every last penny they can out of their customers, then getting the game right.

Just another bunch of morally bankrupt, self serving grifters.

You want to earn some points back IOI, let us turn off the voice of that sanctimonious, arrogant patronising Diana, the last thing I need to hear after your shonky piece of software has just screwed me over for the umpteenth time is her voice prattling on."

For 3 years, Hitman has been in limbo for any updates. Some of them are just great tweaks to the visual design, while others are great additions to the game. This includes: weapons. Get Jackson out of your defenders. Fight as you know how.

I've been playing for months, and today I'm finally a month away from the new game. Of course, there are new weapons and perks. But I have a lot of time to be free and have fun. Here are 5 things I could have done better. They are listed in no particular order, they are all good and can be found in the following order:

* Weapons for all characters, even low level

* Choose the light's color scheme and visual cues (you know, tell me if this particular blue smoke light is in a white van, etc.).

* New theme song, good credits

* More weapons per character with attachments to the weapons used

* Weapon decay system (after losing all weapons"
VibranToucan,"Jan 31, 2023",9,"Really fun game. This game is not for you, if you do not care about your score. The intended way to play  this game is too retry missions to get a better score. This is surprisingly fun as there are so many creative solutions to beating each level, you could sink dozens of hours in one level alone and still discover a new way to achieve your goal. Even if you just want to get a - star rating in every mission, this game is fun and gives you many options. Definitely worth it."

""Hitman 3, when taken as the complete World of Assassination package, ranks as  one of my favourite games of all time. It’s a masterclass in gaming that takes what made the originals so good and expands upon it, removing those clunky controls and making it feel so damn good. It’s a shame then that it’s spoiled by being a cloud game, and has all the issues you’d expect from that. If you are like me and have no other viable way of playing the game, I would recommend trying out the demo to see how well it runs on your connection. The game is certainly a masterpiece and all the additional modes and custom contracts will ensure that hardcore fans have a lot of content to play. I’ve clocked in at over 100 hours and have barely scratched the surface of what’s on offer. I can easily see myself hitting 1000 hours before hitting the 100% mark. In fact, the only reason the game doesn’t score higher in terms of value is simply because I just don’t own the game. I’ll have put in all this work, and then one day IO Interactive will take it all away from me. And that truly ****…""

MakaiHanta,"Feb 6, 2022",0,"[Оценка ВР версии]
Я, если честно, в ахуе. Настолько неудобную игру я встречаю впервые. Движение руками как будто в каком-то киселе находишься, стрельба из двуручного оружия отвратительная (еще и перезарядка на кнопку, а не как это обычно принято), игра не может определить, стоишь ты или сидишь, ток по отдельной кнопке это делается. А когда предложили пострелять со снайперски я вообще заржал в голос. Подобную поебень до вас еще никто не делал. Самое смешное, что после стрельбы из нее у меня забогавала моделька персонажа.
Еще и все интерактивные элементы работают на скриптах. Хотя не, вру, кнопки нажимать и двери открывать ты можешь сам

Сомневаюсь, что буду в это играть еще"

Do not judge strictly my English :) For me, Hitman is the best game of all, even how to say, for me it is not just a game, but something more, I have lived my whole life (not a small part of mine), and the life of Agent 47, starting with the first parts of Hitman, and ending with this, the third part. I played the first part of Hitman Codename 47 for the first time when I was 7 years old (despite the fact that I was 18+, but there was no age limit yet), and as a person it did not spoil me:) Honestly, I can't say how beautiful every detail is, thank you so much that the developers don't give up on this masterpiece.

AtoMops,"Jul 31, 2021",7,"Sadly the weakest of all 3 parts compared to Hitman 1 and Hitman 2.
Hitman 1 was a new approach and it worked out well. Hitman 2 put some new ideas and very beautiful maps on top. I loved both of them.
But Hitman 3 is a soulless ""people will buy it anyway""-production. It is playable if you are a fan of the series but you will see that there is no love in this one. Don't know what happened to the producer team. Maybe the staff was exchanged and the new programmers just used what was already there from their predecessors?!

The other thing is the difference between ratings of ""professional reviews"" and user reviews. Hitman 3 does not deserve a score higher than 8. I know you need the money but please grow some balls. Otherise your reputation will suffer.
Also some reviews are obviously bought. 10 out of 10? Sorry no way ^^'

Just like Hitman 1 and Hitman 2, this game is very good.
The mechanics are great, just like the story and gameplay.

You have endless ways of playing this game.
Whether it is by going all in and just shooting up everything and everyone, or by doing the complete opposite and playing it stealthy, you can do it all.
The amount of ways you can kill your targets and play these missions, is what really makes the Hitman games great and unique games.

I can definitely recommend this game, as well as Hitman 1 and Hitman 2."

There are jarring bugs at every turn making even the most simple task impossible. Not only this, but on maps that have been in this game for over 4 years there are still bugs they have yet to fix. I really hope they can improve this game, but at this state it is completely unplayable."

PassiveDre,"Mar 10, 2021",9,"HITMAN 3 is a wonderful conclusion to the world of assasination trilogy, it ends the trilogy on a high note and it doesn't dissapoint. The breathtaking game level and design, the fantastic story, oh and maps look and feel alot better, the england mission is a perfect example, it does something new with you solving a mystery and even has alot of secret rooms, stuff to investigate, its truly a breath of fresh air, gameplay didnt change at all, and nothing notable was added asides from the camera but hey at least we get a camera, like the earlier games in the trilogy, there is alot to explore and uncover. For the story, characters remain great, performances were solid, ending was kinda weak but it was fun killing multiple people on a train. Voice lines for the AI were straight up repetitive but that's my only complaint.

9/10 would very reccomend!"

The gameplay mechanics are the same. The graphics are pretty much the same. But out of the three games, personally Hitman (2016) was the best. The final level in Hitman 3 was a bit underwhelming but if you're a fan of this franchise, you won't be disappointed with the final installment in this series."
loveforfire,"Mar 5, 2021",9,"I've loved the Hitman series since 2012 and have loved every game in the series, and Hitman 3 is no exception. IO have put out another game full of engaging missions and a storyline that is full of surprises.  Also if you think the graphics are the same as the first or ""dated"" you should watch a comparison video, as they are a big improvement with each sequel. Some have said its ""boring"" but if you enjoy stealth games or Hitman then you'll enjoy this one as well. Those who can't enjoy it are likely casual gamers or not fans of Hitman/Stealth."
BoiLoi,"Mar 3, 2021",8,"The game is fun and interesting. This is one of the only games where I actually enjoy doing challenges. The story is good. I have experienced bugs and glitches, some challenges don't work and unless you have the hitman 1 goty or hitman 2 access pass you don't have a lot to play since there aren't many escalations, but you can play custom contracts. The visuals are great, but only on like 2 missions. Very good game, but you're going to have to wait for it to be amazing."

Methael,"Feb 20, 2021",7,"First of all im a big fan of Hitman franchaise played all the games many times for many hours but Hitman 3 is definetly not my favourite Hitman game.

Hitman 3 is visually good and good optmized game. Level desings are amazing. But its really short and very easy compare to other games. Even you can complete it ""suit only"" without giving much effort. Most disappointing part for me was the game being very easy. If you want to know whats being easy compare to other games heres a list:

1 - Almost no CCTV in most of the levels. Even if there is, its really easy to find and get rid of survelliance system.

2- AI is just really stupid they are having hard time to notice you. There is less patrols and people compare to other games.

3- Remember mission stories that you can have many ways to kill a target. There is really few in Hitman 3 even some missions missing it. Of course you still have few ways to complete but its still missing.

Basicly even Hitman 1 training levels are more harder compare to all missions of Hitman 3. That was the most dissappointing part for me. I hope they get rid of this episodic storyline soon and bring a long and challenging Hitman game."

Nesomnia,"Feb 19, 2021",0,"Man this game would be fantastic if the last update hadn't broken it. It crashes anywhere from 5-45 minutes after launching. Makes contracts, escalations, elusive targets, and anything you can't save during basically impossible to do. Reaching out to IOI or trying to find help on the forums is like shouting into a hole.
Pros: Couldn't tell you, game crashes too quickly to tell.
Cons: Crashes quickly."
Jach,"Feb 18, 2021",6,"To summarize shortly, here is what you need to know about the good things :

+ Very good Hitman game in itself, a lot of things to do, and it's fun to play. Storyline is good but could have been better.

Now the bad things :

- Very bad server issues from IO Interactive, and very bad communication about it, they are acting like it's not their responsibility.
IOI is acting very rudely here (just check out their twitter posts)

- Almost forced Steam owners of H2 to rebuy the game in Epic Game Stores.
Thanks to players voicing the problem, IOI stated they will try to make it free.
Edit 18th February 2021 : it is finally imported, it took around a month since launch.

- 1 year exclusivity in EGS, I highly condemn this kind of behaviour, it is anti-players (and I'm not even talking about the other problems in EGS in general)

So, what I can say is that you should wait for a Steam release if on PC, otherwise enjoy your Sony or Microsoft console ;)"

FranticFrog,"Feb 14, 2021",3,"If you LOVED Hitman 1&2 you will... kinda like this?! It's an okay game I guess. Known formula, less content (or so it feels to me). Subtracting 1 point because Epic Games Launcher at least for me is buggy as hell (needed 2 hours to get the game working at all; at second start it doesn't recognize installation folder). Subtracting another point because close to a month after game launch locations from Hitman 1&2 are still not accessible in Hitman 3 (and I think it's a bit misleading that they advertise that progress can be transferred - I personally thought this means maps as well and would not have bought).
Overall I think this is pretty clearly on the DO NOT buy list."

Bloodhammer99,"Feb 9, 2021",7,"As someone who considers hitman 1 and 2 some of the best games ever made, unfortunately I don't think that's the case with this game. Its still a very good game but has some ideas that don't work with the hitman formula, primarily the berlin and final level. This is the game where franchise fatigue sets in and im glad its the final one. Its still worth buying and still has quite a bit of content but it only has 1/4th of the content of the previous games. Levels are bigger and more open but feel more restrictive since they have less things to do in them. There is also less than half of the mission stories of the first 2. Its less replayable and levels feel connected in a bad way, it feels more like 1 more linear and focused experience than 6 separate locations with a lot of things to do like 1 and 2. However, credit where credit is due, its still a fun and engaging game throughout and makes you feel like a badass. Furthermore the compression here is great and manages to fit all 3 games in just 60gb, they also improved and polished the mechanics a bit more In this entry making them even better than they were in hitman 2. Its not a must play but its definitely worth your time."
AndrewBrimstone,"Feb 8, 2021",10,"A stunning end to one of gaming’s best trilogies. Hitman III is an endlessly replayable distillation of everything great about IO’s signature series.

tdebug,"Feb 5, 2021",1,"I am a stealth fun and often using stealth is most of the game, where it not required but just an option, like Dishonored, Deus Ex, Skyrim, Cyberpunk and you name it. This one I simply could not get. Weird controls mechanics, totally scripted world. Graphics reminded me GTA 4 maybe, or I don't know how to describe but you can call it beautiful but in the same time - lack or details perhaps, which makes everything look plain and unnatural.
What I can say for sure, it is definitely NOT a game for stealth lovers. It is a game for Hitman lovers and only for them. If you not sure if you want to buy it or not and never played Hitman before, then buy Hitman 2, which is available for around 5€ nowadays. Graphics there is almost exactly the same, as well as mechanics and everything else, just story and levels are different. And if you don't really like Hitman 2, there is absolutely no reason to waste 60€ on Hitman 3.
And yes, on top of everything else, this game is also incredibly short. Like many people said here already it is more like Hitman 2 DLC which barely worth 20€."

Purchased the deluxe version and by now I’ve uninstalled the game. Hitman 1/2 are still unavailable to play through hitman 3 and my progress was wiped. The bugs are constant and the game feels like it wasn’t worth anywhere close to full price"
UnknownMight,"Feb 5, 2021",9,"Before even getting into Hitman there are a few very import things to know.
This game is not supposed to be played in a traditional manner, i.e. you beat a level, follow the campaign and it's over.  By design the game is focused on replayablity, the player is asked to play the same level like 6 times (well by abusing save states anyway) and witness all the little details a map has to offer.
Each stage has about a good dozen path that leads to completion, however each path can be done in matter of minutes. This is not to be confused with game time padding, since every aspect of a map feels very detailed and well designed. Play the game in a straight line to finish and the game lasts no more than 10 hours, yet you played it wrong. Witnessing each little kill scenario is extremely satisfying, however even still HITMAN is a far cry from being a perfect game...here are the Pros(+) and Cons(-):
+ Much like every Hitman, the maps in Hitman 3 are vast and full of life, the player is incentivized to leave no stone untouched. In a sense Hitman always has been a game well suited for completionists
+ Hitman 3 in introduces new game mechanics apart from just reskinning the target and changing the landscape. The new mechanics are so cool they will put a grin onto players face, however...
- the new mechanics are at times half assed. For instance, the player might go like ""cool, time to be a master [... ]"", just before you had the time to solve a problem on your own Diana quickly spoils you the answer over intercom.  Was it too much to asking to demand a full experience?
+ Fortunately the story really picked up and is no longer just an excuse to kill targets. At its climax the tension is gonna makes players heart race. the player is given the feeling to almost have lost control over the situation, however, that tension quickly faded because
- enemies still don't evolve. The enemy NPCS you met in the first tutorial chapter might very well be the same reskinned object you meet throughout the entire game. Even though this is a design choice it sometimes doesn't really match the enemies profile. It is disappointing to see some enemies that are supposed to be more vigilant still make a 180° turn to a coin toss like any other AI.
+ This makes it sound easy but in reality there are difficulty settings for everyone. Beating the game normal is fun enough, to really experience Hitman I highly recommend beating SASO(hardest things to do) on every level. Every level is designed in a way that SASO can be accomplished without being a pro gamer, and it really spices up things because the player will need to bring out their inner Solid Snake
- there is one problem however, again with the AI, which is the lack of random. All AI are programmed to have the exact patrol and schedule to the second. This takes away the tension of the unknown and makes repeated attempts a bit boring since it eventually just becomes a memory game. The player would remember at which second this NPC is gonna do that, no more actual thinking and improvising is involved. I understand this is not MGS, but maybe an extra difficulty setting which makes things more random just the perfect topping."

Vanished_Critic,"Feb 2, 2021",9,"أحداث اللعبة تستكمل قصة الجزء السابق وهي بكل اختصار القضاء على شركاء البروفيدنس ولكن للأمانة خل نكون صريحين إن لعبة نفس هذي تكون القصة فيها مو مهمة، وإن أغلب اللاعبين يلعبونها لنظام اللعبة نفسها بالتسلل في القضاء على الأهداف عن طريق التخطيط والتخفي. اللعبة فيها ست مراحل في ست دول مختلفة وكل مرحلة فيها تفاصيل كثيرة ومصممة بعناية ودقة بشكل أغلب اللاعبين ما يتصورونه. اللعبة تعطي اللاعب الحرية المطلقة في طريقة إنهاء مهمته سواء عن طريق قتل الشخص المطلوب بشكل مباشر أو بطرق إبداعية اخرى وتحتوي على عدد كبير من التحديات لكل مرحلة تجعل اللعب أكثر حماس ومتعة ولكن في نفس الوقت أغلب التحديات متعارضة وتتطلب إنك تعيد المرحلة أكثر من مرة وهذا الشي ممكن يملل الكثير من اللاعبين ولكن في نقطتين جدا مهمين. النقطة الأولى إنك تقدر تحفظ توصيلك مباشرة قبل لا تخلص أحد التحديات وبعد ما تخلص ترجع وتكمل واللعبة تسمح إنك تسوي هالحركة والنقطة الثانية إن على الرغم من كثرة التكرار وحفظك للمرحلة بعد فترة إلا أنك ما تحس بالملل لأن اللعبة تعطيك خيارات كثيرة ومتعددة وأسلوب اللعب فيها جدا ممتع. طبعا كلاعب مو مجبور إنك تخلص تحديات اللعبة وتقدر تنهي اللعبة بالطريقة اللي تبيها وما راح تطول معاك ثمان ساعات تقريبا ولكن شخصيا ما أشوف أن هذي فكرة اللعبة ولا سعر اللعبة يسوى عليها إذا إنت حاب تلعبها من دون لا تنهي أغلب تحدياتها. من ناحية الصعوبة اللعبة تسمحلك إنك تختار الصعوبة اللي تبينها وتقدر تخلص كل شي فيها على أسهل صعوبة لكن لتجرب ممتعة أنصحكم تلعبونها على الصعوبة المتوسطة. طريقة اللعب ما عليها أي كلام واللعبة تعطيك خيارات كثيرة ومتنوعة وقصصها الجانبية في كل مرحلة مختلفة. الأصوات والمؤثرات الصوتية واضحة وممتازة والتصوير جدا جميل ودقيق. أقدر أقول إن اللعبة من الألعاب اللي نجحت في تسويق نفسها وإعطاء اللاعب التجربة الفعلية اللي يبحث عنها في هذا النوع من الألعاب. بكل اختصار مطورين اللعبة أخذوا أغلب ملاحظات اللاعبين على الأجزاء السابقة وعدلوها في هذا الجزء من اللعبة. هذا الكلام مو معناته إن اللعبة ما عليها أي ملاحظات. الشي اللي كنت أتمناه إن عدد التحديات يقل في كل مرحلة وبالمقابل تزيد عدد المراحل باللعبة. بالنهاية اللعبة قدمت تجربة فريدة في هذا النظام من الألعاب.

من الآخر:

1- مراحل اللعبة الستة تحتوي على تفاصيل كثيرة ومصممة بعناية ودقة بشكل الكثير من اللاعبين ما يتصورونه.
2- عدد كبير من التحديات والمهام في كل مرحلة والي تجعل اللعب أكثر حماس ومتعة كما إن أسلوب اللعب ممتع لكثرة الخيارات وتعددها.
3- نجاح اللعبة في إعطاء الاعب التجربة الفعلية لنظام التسلل والتخفي بهذا النظام من الألعاب.
4- كثرة التحديات في كل مرحلة وقله عدد المراحل يدفع إلى كثرة تكرار نفس المهام ولكن بأساليب مختلفة."

gregormax,"Jan 30, 2021",6,"And once again Critic Scores are higher than User Scores. Hitman 3 is not a game deserving 9/10 or above. Actually since years the game not only doesn't offer something new, but in matter of mechanics, bugs, AI, etc. is exactly the same. This wouldn't be bad if these things were working properly and be of high quality, but that's just not the case. Shooting is a disaster, I don't know if snapping to the enemy even works (doesn't seem to make any difference), but the sensitivity is just too high. Yeah, you can lower it in settings, but then the camera is moving too slow during fights. The AI is just a mess, like in all previous Hitman games. I don't know if they have changed anything in this respect, it's the same bad AI we've got in the previous games. NPCs are just plain stupid and that's frustrating. I don't want to spoil anything, but they can be shooting at you, you enter the toilet and hide in a box and... they just leave you alone. And that's just the tip of an iceberg. Also the main menu is a mess and I mean a real mess. It's so messy that you even don't know how to continue your game the next day. And of course during missions your options are very limited, because you need to level up to gain access to new stuff to get new abilities - then you can replay the mission and try a different approach. Why the hell would I want to replay the same mission? That's just dumb. So yeah - if you like the Hitman series just like me (I've been playing it since the first one) you will still find some fun, but don't expect that any issues from the previous games are solved here or the AI is better. Not a chance. Graphics are really great, the music is also very nice, but indie games have better AI."

Ну и еще на каждом уровне можно убивать целей разными способами, раз за разом каждый раз можно посмотреть как цели умирают разными способами и это круто, +- за 2300 вы получаете трилогию это довольно дешево и пройти всем  любителям стелса ну или даже ОБСАЛЮТНО ВСЕМ НАДО ПОКУПАТЬ так как в трилогию можно пройти и без стелса) ну конечно лучше со стелсом ну да ладно."

arrivist,"Jan 29, 2021",6,"Pretty underwhelmed and disappointed. The previous two in this series were better, and Hitman 3 feels short with only 6 levels, The story is rather weak and except for the odd level,  I don't buy into the replay value,. The first three Hitman  games (prior to Blood Money) had a lot more depth and style about them, particularly Contracts. I think the developers need to get some better writers and concept artists. They won't care of course because they've made a fortune already.

Gráficamente es una auténtica pasada con que mimo se hizo hasta el último detalle.

La Campaña cumple muy bien junto a un sistema de ""Leveo"" y el ya clásico desbloqueo de objetos y zonas para repetir los niveles de diferentes maneras.

AmirMohammad100,"Jan 27, 2021",8,"Hello to all gamers across the globe. In my opinion, Hitman games in the game industry have a style and are one of the first successful games in the stealth style. I haven't played the third version of this game yet, but from the only version I have ever played, Blood Money‌, and also from the reviews and trailers I have seen and read, I think a score of eight out of ten is suitable for this game. Friends, know that please do not be prejudiced in any field, and give me points for voting as much as you enjoyed the game, not that some friends, because they like a certain type of game and dislike this game, for example, And give low scores to this game. So please give concessions so that the right reaches the rightful. Thanks"
DexEngineer,"Jan 26, 2021",4,This game feels like an extension. Dated cut scenes. Dated engine. Playing feels a bit like slo-mo. Very linear. Constant crashing trows fun out of a window. Expected more from Hitman 3.
ZKwest85,"Jan 26, 2021",9,"To start If you’ve played Hitman; Hitman 2, then this game will be familiar and seamlessly fits into the story of both. If you haven’t you should start with the first two but it’s not entirely necessary to play Hitman 3

IOI has found a perfect formula mixing action and stealth that I have only seen personally in Metal Gear Solid 5, kudos to them for sticking to that formula and not trying to revamp anything to entice new customers. Hitman 3 plays the same as the first two Hitman games in the world of assassination trilogy, sandbox style with a lot of freedom to make your own path, or predesignated storylines you can follow for opportunities to get your mark. What makes this series unique is you can ideally go through a set of prompts that lead to a 1on1 meeting and unless you’ve planned ahead or the moment is perfect, you may not even get the chance to take out your mark. You may need to double back or complete another story line if it’s even available as some expire within a certain timeframe. I love that the developers treat the player as intelligent as they are capable of being and not holding their hand the whole way. This is one of few games where I can say the developers deserve the applause and revenue for this masterpiece of stealth that’s both hilarious and exciting. I heard IOI is making a 007 sandbox stealth game in the same fashion as the Hitman series, if this game is any indication of what that project could be like they will definitely get my money again happily so

Also kudos on the how the first two games fit so well into the whole package, if you begin with Hitman and work all the way up to Hitman 3 (within the 3rd game) it feels like one long beautiful game not splintered or otherwise noticeable that the first game released in 2015. More developers should do this especially with trilogies"
Trofim,"Jan 26, 2021",8,"I love hitman series. So i'm quite biased.

In 2005-2010 i only bought dvd versions of video games, i never cared about some steam bs. All that mattered was that i could play certain game on PC. That's absolutely ONLY thing that mattered. I would have been so happy in 2006 to get all the mortal kombat games for pc that they never released. I would have cared less what store i'm using to buy them. This ""only steam"" thing is pathetic at this point."
Fallensolider,"Jan 26, 2021",10,Very fun hitman game with really beautiful graphics. Would recommend to old fans for sure and even for those who haven't played hitman before. It's worth a try.
EldenRing,"Jan 26, 2021",10,People who give this game zero are literally disgusting people and should just give up gaming in general. Nobody wants people like you in gaming community. Bunch of whining idiots. Hitman 3 is great game for what it is and succeeds at what it set out to be and do.
mtav48,"Jan 25, 2021",8,"Hitman 3 is absolutely beautiful with really impressive detailed locations that you have never seen in the Hitman series. The graphic is the best quality in this series on Ultra and 2x Multisampling. It's a good game but it is not an unforgettable experience and also it can not be the best experience of this series. Because there are some problems yet and everything is not beautiful as the graphic!
But whats the problems? First of all, Hitman 3 is too short, You can finish all the game only in One day. Story cutscenes are really numb and I wonder that how did IOI come to do this? Animations in cutscenes are significantly Weak and it's compared to old games ten years ago !! This is the main reason that you don't like to follow the story as a gamer. The second problem is gameplay design, Missions are really easy without any serious challenging. It seems they made it for amateur stealth fans !! The third important problem is AI. I never see the same AI weakness in previous versions like 2016 or 2018. AI problems make the game even more easily. I killed peoples but in-ranged persons didn't notice, even anybody didn't follow me. Mission stories are not many and all of these problems that I said may cause that you even don't like to play the game again!
There is an important note that maybe good or not. Levels are not like before, it's Story-based more.
I think this is good because it causes that you feel some differences in this version rather than before.
I forgot to say about soundtracks. I love the new soundtrack. it's really great."
AgentMC84,"Jan 25, 2021",9,"I really don't understand how anyone that actually played this game, can give it a score of zero? Even though you can complete each `mission rather quickly, it is basically your choice to do so. Each mission can be played and explored in various different ways and there are a bunch of side missions you can participate in. I have already put 12 hours into the game and just started mission 5 today because of the exploration I did so far. There are a ton of unlockables and you can start and end each mission in different ways, so how you approach the objectives is totally up to you since you are the hitman. The story is very well done and I am really enjoying it so far. Overall, this is a very polished game and my experience has been enjoyable."
bobsheets,"Jan 25, 2021",10,"Great game, $60 is a little much for expansion basically though. Also lame can't get it on steam, but I somewhat understand the reasons. It's not a big deal to me, since this reviewing the game not the delivery of the game."
ilozxy,"Jan 25, 2021",9,"People who complain about the epic exclusivity are just dumb. This company nearly went under during development of hitman 2 because square enix dropped them. They got lucky that epic bought them out and epic made a contract with them. I got hitman 1, 2 and 3 for a total of 60 bucks without buying gold edition for hitman2.  The game looks great and in some cases better than cyberpunk. When people say graphics look like they are from 2010, that is actual BS. The levels are massive and the dartmoor map is very cool since you can solve a murder to kill your target. The story is bad but no one plays a hitman game for story, they play it for the replayability and smacking people with fix. Overall I think the game is great and worth playing."

Stanton,"Jan 24, 2021",5,"The good: This is a fantastic sandbox/murderbox game, by far the best in the Hitman Trilogy. Adding the levels from the past two games for people who already own them is a nice added bonus.

The bad: This is a single player game that requires internet access to function. Without a constant connection, your progress and achievements won’t unlock, something that is critical to the games great replayability. Unfortunately IOI has dropped the ball in this department, with an initial (forgivable) server overload, but now followed up by lost profiles and a general inability for people to connect.

Verdict: Avoid until IOI acknowledges and fixes the server issues (or even better, remove the online requirement!). The internet requirement is crippling an otherwise excellent game. Poor communication by IOI is only adding fuel the fire. Would totally recommend otherwise.

First of all there is absolutely nothing new added except a 'camera' which you'll use for 10min most. also there are only 6 mission, appalling for a full priced AAA game. Other than that, it's the hitman you know and love. Expansive levels with huge replayability but smaller than the last games, a good story which has been fleshed out more in this game, and some of the best graphics right now. though there was soo much they could've improved on and added but didn't. AI should've been improved, more items to kill and tamper with stuff etc, so pretty much this is a dlc. for that reason i can't give it anything above 7.5, i expect dlc for the little amount of levels that came."

Then there's the story, built up so much in the second one and it ends with a massive wet fart honestly. The villain from the last one magically escapes and you have to track him down.. that's it.

If this game was meant be played in English then just deal with it. Do you even know how many countries don't get their own language version? I can tell you. Many.
TheSavior000,"Jan 23, 2021",10,"Solid enough hitman game, would recommend. 6 very replayable levels and good graphics."
TheAmazingxx,"Jan 23, 2021",9,"Graphics - 8.7/10, Story - 7/10, Level design - 9/10, Characters - 7/10, How fun is it? 9/10"
ReviloRebel,"Jan 23, 2021",10,"Great game... Best Gameplay in a Hitman Game... The new locations are awesome. If you got all 3 Games (Hitman 2016, Hitman 2 2018 and Hitman 3) you can play months to get all the challanges. I think the best Game so far for the new Generation"
TripleBeam,"Jan 22, 2021",4,"this company IO has made the worst iterative changes possible in any video game series. Having perfected the gameplay in Hitman:SA; they've continually stripped and re-added features, from the hideous crawling simulation Hitman Crab-Solution to the barren ""Hitman"" series we know now. This game is closest to SA, although w/o the 1PP camera & advanced AI from that game. Things I hate about new Hitman series and this game are as follows:
- no 1PP camera, absolutely ruins the game from the getgo, the old series was one of the best 1PP in any video game ever. great pacing.
- lazy online focus, SPG so why crappy user missions, 'leaderboards' (all fake w/o exception) and timed garbage DLC - **** off no one cares about that ****
-reduced AI / nerf'd awareness. might as well play with an aimbot / wallhack.
- reduced complexity and systems in every map compared to older games.
Basically it's a Mafia sitiation, where the new devs just aren't as talented as the old devs who work in the indie space now."
vbarbarian,"Jan 22, 2021",10,One of the best games in the franchise. The crazy amount of stuff you can do is insane. **** it's epic exclusive but it's not that big of a deal for such a great stealth game.
timthesmurf,"Jan 22, 2021",10,I think Hitman 3 ended the trilogy in a very different but good way. I didn't expect it to end like this but i really enjoyed it. I also think that the missions have been more interesting sometimes than before.
erixon,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"For me it's a 10. It's a game that I have been waiting for and for sure it's the best hitman.
I'll start from what I didn't like:
-music; the best soundtrack was in Hitman 2
-the fact that they are still working on a method to transfer Hitman 1&2 locations to new game if I have bought them earlier

What I like:
-this game is beautiful and highly replayable
-more story and cinematic features
-great new mechanics, I love the camera and safe codes ideas
-cool locations, Argentina is top
more attention to the story

It's just the perfect ending and I hope that we will recieve a lot of content in this year. I played H2 for about 300h and I that that I'll double this score with this masterpiece. Good job IO Interactive!"
Sweetnesss,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Good story? yes, Good Graphics? yes, Good main character? yes, Interesting missions? yes"
Moviesaredead,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Beautiful game that is first AAA game of 2021 and pretty good. Good start for possibly very good year for video games. There's tons of hits coming like Halo Infinite, Resident Evil Village, Far Cry 6 and many more and hopefully they will help forget cyberbug2077."
honestreviews21,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"At first i was hesitant, but then i was like ""it's not made by cdprojectred, so it' can't be that bad"". To my surprise hitman 3 is solid video game."
Break_Down333,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Little bit short, but overall very enjoyable game. All the hate? just lol, ignore the hate, their opinion means nothing when they can't even point out any flaws and just whine about some stupid sht."
DDD994,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"I'm impressed enough. I mean, let's be real here, Cyberpunk 2077 is now new benchmark for any upcoming video game. And Hitman 3 is very clearly better video game than Cyberpunk 2077, so there's that. It's also good Hitman game overall."
famouslastwordz,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Solid hitman game, would recommend to old and new fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
counting_stars,"Jan 22, 2021",10,It's almost crazy how much care has went into this hitman trilogy compared to what cyberpunk 2077 was. Night and day difference.
lifeiseasy,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Very good Hitman game, i would honestly say it's best of 3 new ones. Ignore the haters, these are just bunch of sad cdproject fanboys."
Walx,"Jan 22, 2021",9,"This game is amazing , maps are amazing , amongst the best in the series , graphics are beautiful, the story is actually quite good and implemented well , endning is surprisingly good compared to the rest of the trilogy

This game has such low reviews because of mostly stupid reasons , I mean for one half of these negative reviews are just people Review bombing it for being and Epic exclusive , that if just wrong and you can’t change my mind , at least play the game before giving it a 0 star  review it’s a great game , some comment on the lack of innovation or change , fair enough but I absolutely loved the last to game and am still loving it and I personally did not carry over progress , aka I have 17 Maps to get 20 / 20 mastery on , seems daunting but I did all maps in hitman 2 (and legacy missions in that game) and I’m ready to do all of the trilogies maps again , which is proof how mutch I love this game ahaha

And next the server issues , they a worse for some , for me it was just a few hours in the evening and as I’m writing this there is a persistent and Albiet annoying bug where as soon as I finish a mission I lose connection aka get no credit or unlocks for the mission , luckily I have an auto save right before but I understand the pain of those playing on master without auto saves that lost their entire missions progress , and yes I am annoyed that I can’t really play the game

However I’m just ignoring the connection issues and the fact I’m missing a couple items such as the requiem pack from hitman 2 for my review as I’m sure they will be resolved soon

But I do fully understand leaving a negative review , although I do think 0s are to low since you’ve not even played the game hahah , but bad  reviews around 5/ 10 or maybe a hit lower are 100% justified though I think IO would appreciate it if you removed them once it’s fixed as the low reviews  probably gonna scare people in the future from getting this amazing game ahaha"
NetQvist,"Jan 22, 2021",2,"Constant disconnects making me lose progress. Missing Hitman 2 content makes it very noticeable how much shorter this game is compared to 1 & 2. A few of the maps are good but the game is just destroyed by bad publishing decisions & online only systems.
The offline mode is practically useless because you literally cannot save a single thing you do."
BIGPEACE,"Jan 22, 2021",9,"Good end of trilogy! The best i would say!
Very good optimization than in the past parts of hitman game! Nice graphic and gameplay, but disappointed that in the game no present Russian language and another Slavic languages!! It's so sad. And i recommend you play this game necessary!"
XyFeX,"Jan 22, 2021",0,"I would love, LOVE, to give this a high score, i loved the past two games, they were absolutely brilliant... and then I went to play this one on release day. The game didn't open, every time it threw an error, so I went to Epic contact for help (I'm playing the Epic Games version on PC, not console). After over 2 days of various attempts to fix whatever the error is, still nothing, not one thing has changed, the game will still not open, and I don't even know what the problem is. This isn't to say the helpers weren't good, they were patient and tried their best to get the game working for me, but the fact that the game is so broken that after 2 days of help, and 6-7 different helpers giving their opinions on ways to fix it, and I'm still getting the exact same error as before I even asked for help, then something's gone wrong. I have never once had issue with the steam versions of Hitman 1 or 2, and have played many much more technically taxing games on my rig with no issues, and this game won't even start up. it's a shame, I was really looking forward to this game."
arholden205,"Jan 22, 2021",9,"Very epic game. If you haven't played the previous two games then it's probably not great, as the story is only so impactful when you have played the previous 2 games. The gameplay is the main focus of this game, and it is great gameplay, continuing its them of wacky"
bullettime00,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Hitman 3 is solid enough game to start 2021 gaming season. It's nothing extremely new, but best of this new Hitman trilogy. Really cool looking big levels (by hitman standard) and very beautiful graphics."
sueyourcompany,"Jan 22, 2021",10,Games like new Hitman series makes me proud to be part of gaming community. True passion and hard work.
newGames,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Cool level design, stealth is nice, graphics shine better than ever. Recommended to all hitman fans."
letthejazzplay,"Jan 22, 2021",10,I would like to thank IO Interactive for making this great Hitman trilogy. Very solid game. These haters are just sad people who very likely play amateurish games like cyberpunk 2077.
theepicness,"Jan 22, 2021",10,Solid work by IO Interactive. CDProjectRed should learn from them how to make working videogames.
youlooose,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"@ Zer0TheHer0, Just to annoy you, i hope they never do it. Solid hitman game by the way."
Life_line,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"All these ""i play videogames since 1980s"" people should just give up already. Very clearly new games aren't made for people over 40. Games are made mostly for people in age range 18 to 38. Hitman 3 is great game. PS: I'm not saying that people over 40 can't enjoy videogames, of course they can, they just aren't target audience."
TheHit,"Jan 22, 2021",10,Thank god there's good game developers and good games in times when awful companies like cdprojectred scam gamers.
GamesMustBeFun,"Jan 22, 2021",10,About million times better than cyberpunk 2077. Very beautiful graphics and fun story.
Andrew21397,"Jan 22, 2021",0,I get it. It takes awhile to design these levels and all the in's and outs of them and the many ways you can complete them but overall this game is completely beyond lazy. Since Absolution came out the engine has basically been the exact same. Hitman 2016 looking COMPLETELY identical to Hitman 2 and 3 with nothing at all being changed or implemented. This game is not worth $60. You have made people pay $180 to own all 3 games that are the EXACTTTTTTT. SAME GAME. It is unfair that you refuse to change anything in the game. Hitman codename 47 up until blood money were all completely different and unique in their own way. Sounds to me like Square Enix is getting knsanely greedy.
aintgood,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Feels good to play something that actually works, after experiencing cyberpunk 2077."
Cherokee_1000,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Great game, surprisingly good start for 2021 in videogame terms. Would recommend."
hitmanthree,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Nice game, beautiful graphics and interesting missions. Might be one of the best Hitman games to date."
BLADExx,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Feels good to play game from developers who actually have some kind of talent, unlike cdprojectred."
maybetoday,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Nice game, might have best levels of all three games. Lots of opportunities and cool things to do."
flowflow444,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Solid Hitman game, would recommend to all stealth fans. If you are huge cod fan, maybe try something else lol."
thetruehero,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Well it's about million times better game than Cyberpunk 2077 and that's all that matters really. It's not revolutionary, but these developers at least care about games they are making."
xartemporas,"Jan 22, 2021",10,"Good gameplay, good graphics, ssr reflections is a nice addition, plays super smooth on pc, replayability at its best. Recommended."
nnnpppvvv,"Jan 22, 2021",0,"непростительное отношение к русскоязычному сообществу игроков. пусть разработчики сами играют в свою игру, если пожалели несколько баксов на перевод пары страниц текста."
ArthurJoelLeo,"Jan 21, 2021",0,"AI is totally awful, they're barely responding to a crime when they see a dead person. Also, there's no breaking neck animation, if there's no neck break animation why we're breaking people's necks? It doesn't make sense. Good graphics with bad animations, it doesn't deserve $60. It supposed to be around $40 or $45, not more than that."
KieranGG,"Jan 21, 2021",8,"There are, without a doubt, some great levels in this game. It feels like everyone has a unique twist and each point has its own merit, but I feel like they may of overdone the size on some levels.
At the China level, for instance, you feel like you want to explore and conquer but not only are there two difficult targets but also an additional objective later on. Not to mention that each objective has its own 'disguise' progression meaning that when going from target to target, it feels like you're almost restarting the level.
I think the bank level from hitman 2(?) is a better example of this. One target, one additional objective with different ways to achieve it, and much quicker overall.

The problem is that in Hitman 3, the levels are supposed to be long it would seem. I've heard some criticism about the final level of the game but I feel it's one of the better levels for a finale. It is very linear (and I still haven't figured out Suit Only Silent Assasin) but it makes you feel unstoppable and ends in a pure sense of power. Bonus points for including a secret ending.

Overall, not a bad game. I much prefer the smaller levels of previous games but that's very much my preference. I think the devs were really trying to show off the scale and ambition of their levels and I'm hoping they can use this updated version of the engine to release smaller levels like Bank or even Hitman 2's starting level."
stephen8454,"Jan 21, 2021",0,"One of my favorite all-time games despite not liking the clownish parts of older versions. This new trilogy is great, I definitely want to see more with more abilities, tech, etc. but really happy to be playing another Hitman game"
Tabare,"Jan 21, 2021",10,"Excellent gameplay. There were server issues on launch day, as with any huge launch.  But the game is running smooth on PS5 now.  The levels are fun, and I can spend hours replaying them."
Lobo720,"Jan 21, 2021",10,Hitman 3 is more of the same but it have awesome graphics and the vr really add somenthing new
er1kane,"Jan 21, 2021",5,"Massively disappointing considering its potential. Maps compared from the first two games to the third one is like night and day. Maps feel very small and rushed and lacks content with some maps containing quite uninteresting gameplay, lacking a lot of the things that in my opinion made the first and second game so good. Not even mentioning that one of the ''maps'' isn't even a map. Expected much more for a finale of the series."
sfgsdgsfgsdg,"Jan 21, 2021",10,"This game is amazing in every aspects,and is the best of this   new trilogy"
AngryYoshi,"Jan 21, 2021",10,I am new to the hitman series and I love this game and the levels. It has great gameplay mechanics.
crabbyboy9,"Jan 21, 2021",10,This game is incredible with it's deep gameplay mechanics this is definitely the best game in the trilogy
odysseus420,"Jan 21, 2021",10,This game is epic and win. IOI has done it again. There's a massive amount of content in there especially considering you get Hitman 1 levels for free for a limited time. I wish it was on Steam instead of the Epic Fail Store but whatever I might grab it next year.
