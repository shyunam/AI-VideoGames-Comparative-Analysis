cread1,"Apr 22, 2024",9,This game will always remain a classic cooperative zombie shooter to look up to.
CrushinMangos,"Apr 13, 2024",8,"Left 4 Dead 2 left like the first ""small game"" to have a huge impact.  While not quite Halo or COD this was another must own game for middle school in the late 2000s. Adding in the original Left 4 Dead maps was a great idea and the game still gets the update or two every once in a while"
AbstractS04,"Apr 5, 2024",8,"Despite it no longer being available on the Xbox Marketplace, it is definitely worth it if you get your hands on a physical copy. 'nuff said, it's a great game. Now if you excuse me, I'm gonna be busy being a one-man cheeseburger apocalypse"
MatthewLim,"Mar 27, 2024",10,"Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best and most fun video games that I've ever played. It has an incredibly fun and engaging gameplay, nicely designed environments, uncommon and special infected, fun campaign, graphics, sound, weapons, and various med-kits. What I really love about playing Left 4 Dead 2 as a zombie game is the tension I feel from the use of music several dark environments, and the threat of special infected that makes you rely on teamwork. Additionally, what I also love is the fact that it also has the previous game's campaign in it with improved visuals. The game may not have a narrative, but all the fun and innovation makes up for it."

OnlyOneSale,"Sep 14, 2023",10,"Have so much love for this game it’s truly something incredible. It’s a timeless classic, even 15 years past release date you can easily find multiple multi player games for each campaign. The versus mode has sadly become full of try hard **** over the past few years, newer players would never be able to experience a game of versus without getting kicked for falling 0.2 seconds behind the team or missing an instant kill spot. The current players on versus mode leave no room for new players or less experienced players to experience such an amazing unique and fun game mode. 

The character are more rounded than the L4D1 survivors. The voice lines are fun and there’s so many secret dialogue hanging around the game just waiting to be discovered by picking up different weapons or just interacting with your teammates. I don’t think I will ever become tired of this game, simply incredible and is still up to todays standard despite its age."

DisneyLover1,"Apr 27, 2021",9,"I thought Left 4 Dead 2 would become a failure after Valve stated after the original game dropped they would put out lot of DLC packs for L4D. When I heard that L4D2 was announced less than a year after L4D, I thought it would be a horrible game but nope.

The game is great with hilarious characters, cool environments, and LOTS OF ZOMBIES!!!! All the guns are fun to use & all the types of special zombies make this co-op game great. Thanks to the modding community, we can create completely quirky & incredible maps for all types of players."

brendo214,"May 22, 2019",8,Left 4 Dead 2 is basically the original game but improved in every single way.
Termin8ter,"Oct 2, 2017",8,"Well, the final Left 4 Dead game before Turtle Rock left Valve in 2011 to pursue new projects. L4D2 is, first and foremost, and blast to play. The gunplay is great, the HUD design is solid, and the art style really fits in the atmosphere of these games. The many zombie variants is cool, and the new weapons thrown in the mix are fun to use too. This game is a blast to play cooperatively, and solo too. However, the story isn't all that interesting or well told, and the gameplay, while being very good, isn't quite rock solid enough for the game to fall back on. Aside from that, L4D2 is a very fun game, but I'd say you should get it for a max of 15$."
JFRuiter,"Jul 10, 2017",10,"Hours and hours of fun. This game features a variety of gamemodes and is very easy to get into, especially with friends. Versus mode is extremely fun and is surprising competitive. However, beginners should beware of online play (versus mode specifically) until they get better at the game. Sometimes people take the game really seriously and will vote to kick those who are not as skilled. Besides this, there still are a lot of people who will work with beginners and help each other survive. I strongly suggest you purchase the DLCs as well if you buy Left 4 Dead 2."
MiguelNeto,"Dec 29, 2016",10,"quando o primeiro Left 4 Dead lançou impressionou tudo mundo, mais o game ainda tinha alguns coisas faltando, como a variedade de armas, e só tinha arma de fogos, Left 4 Dead nao é apenas melhor que o primeiro, é muito melhor, tem armas brancas, como por exemplo katana, taco e etc, tem novos inimigos especiais, como por exemplo o Jockey que é bem chatinho, todos os mapas sao novos, e o grafico teve uma melhorada razoavel, o jogo tem novos personagens, e o roteiro continua nao sendo o ponto forte do jogo, Left 4 Dead 2 é incrivel, junto com Resident Evil 4, sao os meus jogos favoritos de zumbi, alem de ser divertido jogar com amigos tanto online como offline, o jogo tem uma boa trilha sonora, e mapas novos, bem diferentes dos outros. Nota 10"
gameguardian21,"Jun 18, 2016",10,"Left for dead is a really fun coop survival zombie game. The gameplay feels a little bit like doom, but its still pretty soild. The single player mode is the best part, especially if you play with a friend. The multiplayer is decent, but still isn't as good as the single player."
vinicius77777,"Feb 21, 2016",9,"simplesmente o melhor jogo sa valve, gostei muito desse jogo, mo do história e o realismo, a violência extrema, as armas de combate corpo a corpo, o modo versus tudo muito bom. só não dei 10 pelo fato de não dar pra jogar quatro pessoas no modo local, pois era pra dar tranquilo com a quantidade de personagens. espero que a valve lance o 3 pro xbox one. mas, deve estar a altura desse ou melhor."

Nah for real this time! Left 4 Dead 2 is a very improved version of the previous installment: well,  Left 4 Dead!
With a couple of things like more melee weapons, improved graphics, etc.

Let's see what this gem has for us shall we?
First off: The storyline, it's not super special but it gets things done by following a new group of survivors that consists of: Good guy Nick, Bumpah'-carz-Ellis, Worst-kind-of-lawyer-Rochelle, and that one coach dude from punch-out.

As i said, it's not fantastic and you'll have to use your imagination if you want to make this the remarkable masterpiece you want it to be.

The graphics are still the classic, **** if you are playing on a computer that can't render the graphics that are compareable with xbox 360 titles (i am referring to the Steam version of the game)

Soundtrack is fitting, it plays suspense tunes when you're in, let's say ""a pickle"" and plays like buttah'
The weapons are relatively balanced with the exeption of shotguns that are just way too slow when surrounded by a horde of lunatics. Left 4 Dead 2 also has a really realistic physics engine.... yeah, Source... kind of. It varies in physics between Valve games apparently.

Ok, i don't have much more important to say so here's a summary:

Pros:

1) Plays smoothly, the AI is well programmed and the special infected are hella' precise.
2) Soundtrack is immersive and fitting.
3) Storyline is kind of interesting, especially if you have read the L4D Sacrifice comic.
4) Easter eggs and achievements are both very fun to accomplish and find

Cons:

1) Glitches and bugs can ruin your experience
2) Online play **** *ss
3) The new gamemodes are complete ****, they are hard,confusing, and don't add as much to the average experience

In short, this is a very interesting game, i've always seen zombies as an interesting subject and this game gets it right in getting me immersed in the **** that's upon you, and three other **** or either overpowered AI's.

In other words, this game gets the score: ""I can dig it"""
Wimpkid,"Oct 21, 2014",10,"Great game if ONLY PLAYED ONLINE. I say that because when you play offline there is not that much to do and you would feel alone, but if played online it is this very fun and addictive game. The story was really bad but the zombies and the great atmosphere was amazing to play with friends or other zombie slayers."
how_are_u,"Jul 27, 2014",10,"Woah. This game is fun, addictive and you can play in multiplayer. Perfect for messing around and having a laugh if you enjoy blasting zombies' heads off! (Let's be honest know, who doesn't?) Though not as good as DOOM, the fps genre still rocks here, and I will always consider this game one of the best."
Plasmaneedle,"Mar 15, 2014",8,A fun co-op first-person shooter from Valve. It is very team focused and is rather uninteresting if played alone. A worthwhile experience for those who enjoy co-op games.
busbfran,"Jan 5, 2014",8,"The new Left 4 Dead instalment adds little to its predecessor but still bring the joy and addictiveness found within the previous game. slightly updated graphics, new maps, players, weapons and enemies will continue to have you on the edge of your seat. You will have a joy playing with your friends and this is still where the game is at its strongest. One of the best zombie games to date."
arxos231,"Nov 30, 2013",5,"Agh where do I start. Okay before you read this I love the original Left 4 Dead  zombies, forced to use team work to kick undead ass, and play as a zombie to kick living ass sign me up."" Okay *sigh* Left 4 Dead 2 is a huge disappointment for me. First it's like the original with a fresh new coat of paint. Next is that it didn't do anything different, it did add umm let me see FOUR or FIVE new guns(I'll talk about melee weapons later) I mean for real and all they are is a upgraded version that felt like the original weapons just with a different name and shape. As for the special thing in the game is the melee weapons one thing, if you implanted them in this why diD'T THEY ADD IT IN THE ORIGINAL. I'm not kidding they felt like something missing in the original, also the DLC that included the original survivors made this more true. Also the versus is down right broken, survivors damage you quickly, and playing as the survivors it's frustrating cause your team get destroyed easy, and the new infected are just plain boring with the exception of the Jocky.

However there is some redeeming factors, one I liked one new game type called Realism. It's really creative to think of it, in this mode there is no glow around items and teammates so if they get incapacitated you really wouldn't know where they are, also the zombies can not killed instantly with a body shot with a strong weapon like the sniper rifle instead you do more damage if you shot them in the head,*classic* because of the new mode it improved the score a bit.

From a company like VAVLE I thought I would be more impressed but this is just wow just wow."
BritMboh,"Sep 15, 2013",9,"This is probably the finest co-op game out there. The gameplay is perfectly balanced to the difficulty you choose, punishing you if you mess up, tweaking the difficulty depending on your performance; the AI director is great for the pacing. The vs mode is the surprise winner. The strategy needed to defeat the other team is incredibly rewarding, pulling off a perfect infected attack injects adrenaline straight to your joy department. The only problem is playing without allies, but that shouldn't be popular for such a popular game."
metalforbrainz1,"Jul 11, 2013",8,"Such a dissappointment. First, the good stuff. The melee weapons are really cool, and I liked using the machete, axe and guitars the most. It's fun online and has a lot of extra modes. Now with what I don't like. The sniper is poorly balenced and acts like an accurate shotgun. The story is almost none existant and the game is very boring if playing alone. But the fun when playing with friends makes it an 8/10"
WyattTheAwesome,"May 30, 2013",8,"It's Left 4 Dead again, but with new guns, melee weapons, more hilarious characters, better maps and just more fun in general. If you like Left 4 Dead, you're going to absolutely love this game."
houyi111,"May 7, 2013",5,"Don't like it, just zombie hordes, boring...  I played split screen with my friend, so the game play was more fun. still, can't never played it by myself alone, too boring...."
SuperFloorMat,"Apr 28, 2013",7,"I love this game. The difficulty of this game doesn't belong in the AI of the zombies but yourself and teammates. You could play on easy and get demolished if you're just fooling around. The very few weapons that was added isn't much and enough to complain about that there aren't enough weapons for the zombie shooter. The new infected feel generic but easily liked because they pulled them off. Melee weapons added are very very awesome, it upgraded the game twice. though it is fun, I don't think it will get any better than a 7 for me."
mynameisnathan,"Mar 18, 2013",6,"This game is alright. Nothing special. Personally i LOVE Zombies! But this game was kind of disappointing, it is fun to play at times but i found myself feeling like i had to work my way through levels to survive and it wasn't as fun as i thought. Plus the first person view is WAY too close you can barely see what is happening around you. Overall this game isn't terrible but in my opinion it's only worth a rent."
drlowdon,"Feb 26, 2013",9,"As with the original Left 4 Dead 2 sees players take on the role of one of four survivors just after the outbreak that turned most of the population into either zombies or even more powerful mutants. The game leads these Survivors through the south-eastern region of the US bringing the level of dramatic co-op players have come to expect. The game has been criticised in some quarters for being released within a year of the original but it certainly refines the formula enough to justify its existence. For starters there is a greater number of versus modes and the timed survival mode, that only came as a download in the first game, is now available right off the bat. With the introduction of new enemy types teamwork is also more vital than ever before. Wandering of alone is usually a pretty sure way to get yourself killed. Fortunately new weapons are also available including melee weapons. These weapons range from the weak crowbar to swords that can decapitate three or four zombies at once and really bring an extra dimension to the gameplay. Furthermore the main campaign is also better realised with some excellent set pieces. This all contributes to another fantastic multiplayer experience from Valve."
Migda,"Nov 29, 2012",10,I love story about zombie and left 4 dead 2 is really impressive game .This game got best coop ever.I play this game 2 years and still not boring me!!
alex007,"Nov 3, 2012",9,"I never found Valve's ""Left 4 Dead"" to be a great game. Entertaining? Yes. Challenging? Yes. Innovative? To a certain point. But the overall product still lacked a certain panache. It was too limited and too restrictive as if the makers didn't have the time or money to deliver a full product. But just one year later, Valve released this sequel which didn't suffer from the same limitations. By making a few minor adjustments and adding some much needed content, the company had created one of the great XBOX Live experiences. ""Left 4 Dead 2"" may be just a team-based arcade-like shooter, but it is a great one. In fact, it may be the best zombie game I've ever played. The brilliantly conceived cooperative and competitive modes are both fast-paced and intense and require strong team efforts to win. Versus is the best mode, in which two teams of four (survivors vs. zombies) are pitted against each other within a campaign chapter. L4D 2 also features Realism mode which amps up the campaign's difficulty, a horde mode (Survival) and Scavenger, a take on Capture the Flag. ""Left 4 Dead 2"" is a great tactical game with fun characters, plenty of gore and a nice variety of weapons. It's one of 2009's best games. 9.5 out of 10"
Goodtaste13,"Oct 13, 2012",5,"Left 4 Dead 2 is pretty much the same as the first one, except for the better wepons and graphics. But other than that its the same. No suspene, no other survivors, and no cutscenes."
hollowfication,"Aug 27, 2012",10,"i  love this game hope the 3rd left 4 dead in work but  love zombies killing but what wrong with game australia ban this game censored it!!! but i got uncut version i love this one more gore more action.  censored version got less gore not good action.

but how ever uncut  more gore festive"
StarfyCough,"Jul 26, 2012",10,"I thought that this game was really amazing. The fact that the game is fast paced makes it even better.
Roaming through the towns, cities, streets, buildings, roads, highways, and even forests facing zombies and ""special"" undead. You can find guns and melee weapons in all of the levels. I gave this game a 10 because it deserved it for the graphics, gameplay, plot, easy controls, and challenging but really fun levels."
RomecoolR,"May 13, 2012",6,"This game needs some work. When i say work i mean WORK!!!!!!! I kinda like it. But it needs work on graphics. If you like zombies, then you might want this game it is ok for its price. But the first one ****!!!!!!"
ForestFox,"May 3, 2012",10,"As a player i don't feel im abandoned by the developers in: the multiplayer experience for example, there are a lot of people playing it, I dont feel the developers created this videogame to only profit, always updating, there is a visual and history essence un compared to all other ""last humans on earth""."
watithink123,"Apr 13, 2012",8,A very good game and again another master piece . New characters which was nice. New zombies was very cool and much more guns and melee weapons which was a very nice touch to it. Many game modes are back and a few new ones as well.    Campaigns 9/10   The old modes 8/10   The new modes 8/10   Left 4 Dead 2 8.7/10
Gyro231995,"Mar 31, 2012",9,The people on the PC version are cooperative and helpful. Don't bother with the console version; the other people ruin what is an amazing game with lack of teamwork.
Josh_47ra,"Mar 6, 2012",9,"Really fun and awesome reply value. Story lacking, not enough dialogue, but really fun multiplayer, dynamic levels with differing items, special infected, and common hoardes."
MW3,"Jan 17, 2012",10,This game was AWESOME !! but to bad i traded my left 4 dead 2 for prototype and pkm pearl. This game is one of the best       i highly recommend it
KAS--Will,"Dec 27, 2011",4,"Disappointed to say the least.  I've loved Valve right up to this point with Left 4 Dead.  L4D was good, but nothing special to me, and then this mod came out and I lost all hope in Valve ever really redeeming themselves in the next 5 years..."
DamonofDBP,"Dec 23, 2011",9,"Okay, this is a Modern Review of this game. Since there has been many DLC's to change gameplay. I will like all my other reviews, put in three categories about the gameplay, multiplayer,  and campaign. Gameplay: The gameplay in this game is fantastic. It's very well done compared to the original Left 4 Dead 2. The graphics are touched nicely but it has some slight bugs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiplayer: The multiplayer has 7 different modes with the returning Versus, Survival and Campaign. Left 4 Dead 2 has also added other game modes such as Scavenge, Realism, Mutation (DLC) Versus Realism (DLC) This game was meant for more then one player, which it obviously shows in the gameplay. Overall, the Multiplayer faction of this game is near perfect, with some lag issues from its dedicated servers. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Campaign: Okay, lets all admit, this game as a very feeble storyline. The story is, four survivors (Ellis, Nick, Coach, and Rochelle) are abandoned at a rescue center in the middle of the apocolypse. This causes them to fight through the 6 campaigns (1 is a DLC, there are also two other campaigns which come from a DLC with the original Left 4 Dead.) against thousands (Literally) of infected, with 7 types of Special infected. These special infected have various abilities. The 7 infected are: Smoker, Hunter, Witch, Boomer, Tank, Jockey, Spitter and Charger. All 7 have various abilities customed to fit their own roles. -----------------------------------------------------------------
I rate this game a 9"
XRAIN,"Dec 10, 2011",5,"The gameplay is very good and playing versus is increadibly fun. Unfortunely the community killed this game. Most of the players don't know what word ''teamwork'' means at all, making playing this game increadibly annoying to play. If you can run this game fine on computer, buy this game to it. Avoid Xbox 360 port at all cost."
Brazenotaku,"Dec 2, 2011",9,"Awesome environments, characters, weapons and some of the most addictive gameplay I've ever come across. The graphics aren't the best around even when it came out and the frame rate dips so it isn't perfect   but in my opinion it's the best zombie game around."
L4DLegend91,"Nov 28, 2011",9,"Probably one of the more addicting games out there, it's hard not to love Left 4 Dead 2. Most people think it's a rushed sequel to a great game and that it fails in comparison to the original, but in almost every category Left 4 Dead 2 is better. The only think that Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't measure up to Left 4 Dead in is characters. In L4D, we had memorable characters who had real life to them but in this game, they seem almost as dead as the zombies. Other than that, L4D2 shines above L4D. More maps at launch, tougher difficulties, more game modes, new infected, weekly updates, you can't go wrong."
biscuitboy46,"Nov 21, 2011",9,A very fun and addicting game with better weapons and more pickups then the first. Multiplayer is very fun and balanced although it can get laggy at times. Overall one of the best zombie games out there.
kippy32,"Nov 20, 2011",8,"First off, I love this game, and everything about it, the art style, the voices, the characters and the maps, all great. In this installment all of the campaigns link up, and make sense (if you play them in the correct order that is) which is a vast improvement from the previous title. The addition of the new infect characters really add a different swing into your play, as you now have to take into account the spitter, which can deal great deals of damage to stationary players and the charger, which can and will boul through your team and split you up as you try to navigate your way to the safe room. The best thing about this game is the competitive edge that the Versus mode gives you, and the ability to play as the infected is a great experience."
asylumspadez,"Nov 15, 2011",7,"While multiplayer has seen quite a bit of updating, Pretty much everything is the same. Short campaign with no replay value, The exact same gameplay with no difference what so ever, Decent graphics that are poorly designed. Left 4 Dead 2 doesnt impress as much as the first game does."
Tayskasi,"Sep 10, 2011",7,"I do not see how this game deserves a 8.9 in user scores. This game is a average FPS with unlimited ammo and weak zombies. Single player is boring and graphics are disappointing and repeating. Multiplayer is better if you play it with friends, but same goes with any other multiplayer. I did not like this game, even though I am fan of Half Life and Resident Evil series."
SarahCuda,"Aug 14, 2011",10,"Awesome Zombie killing game like the first one it was alot of fun. L4D2 has new zombies that catch you by suprise and can make you jump, like when you hear a tank coming it still makes your heart raise, gore was awesome, head shots were satisfying. Maps were great. Still wish they had more female charaters :l sure did miss the old charatersas well. But all in all a great game"

Ok to start off the best part of this game is the co op ive never had more fun in co op ever. Next the characters are such a great batch of zombie killers. next the guns, they were fun to use and great to shoot. and finally the many different chapters and maps make the game a reallf fun time and a great chance you will want to play again."
DravenatorLives,"Jul 22, 2011",10,"This game is a tiny bit better than the first, an achievement only met by few games. The campaigns are old-school, and the characters and weapons are much better than the first collection. Valve has a tradition of putting developer commentary on their games, and I played thru the campaign with the dev commentary, as I always do. It enhanced my experience, and I suggest this game to anyone."
Susano,"Jul 4, 2011",9,"For a long while, Team Fortress 2 was my favourite Live game, with it's varied character classes and Pixar-esque graphical style. The along came Left 4 Dead 2. Left 4 Dead 2 offers TF2 style variety, and then some. Taking the class-based formulae and filling it with BRAAAAAAAAIIIIIINNNNNSSSS, L4D2 is a near-perfect multiplayer game, that any self respecting game should play. It's a really solid shooter, firstly, as playing as the survivors is just as fun as being the zombies, thanks to fun weapons and grenades. And then I move on to the zombies themselves, who play the more tactical game. Survivors cling together to survive, while the zombies get to choose crafty spawn points to suit their classes particular skills. The Boomer, a puking, fat zombie that can cause a huge hoard of common infected to attack the survivors, either by puking on them or exploded on them. There's also the Spitter, who throws a great big acid patch onto the floor, damaging the survivors and, if your particularly crafty, netting you a few Achievements. There's also the Smoker and Hunter, the former dragging survivors to there death with his huge tongue, while the latter climbs onto rooftops before leaping onto survivors and ripping them to pieces. The Charger and the Tank are sort of similar, as the Charger is a hulking brute who grabs survivors and pummels them, while the Tank just generally throws rocks and smacks survivors into oblivion. The last playable Infected is the Jockey, who jumps onto survivors and drives them into the zombies, causing said survivor to become a mound of flesh and blood. The single player campaign is also enjoyable enough, but it's far superior in co-op, with all it's zombie shooting, grenade throwing, with stalking shenanigans. Ah yes, the Witch. The Witch is a fast, powerful Infected who if you startle will kill you or knock you down, and then you will have to rely on your fellow survivors to help you. With is the point of the game really-teamwork. It forces you to work with your friends for a truly great survival-based multiplayer game, whilst being both addictive and satisfying."
momslove,"Jun 30, 2011",10,This is my favorite **** newer special infected are so much harder to fight that it just makes me want to play the game more so i can challennge myself. This game is great for multiplyier and a blast to play onine!
doodlerman,"Jun 18, 2011",10,"Takes L4D1 and makes it so much better. The graphics are improved dramatically and so is the gameplay experience. The scenarios are much more intense - such as a flaming apartment building (or is it a hotel?). The new special infected add a sense of more caution, or if you're good enough, at the very least, a sense of more excitement. Just about everything in this game is better than the first - even the music is better. The multiplayer and online experiences are much funner and are more of a challenge. This Left 4 Dead is worth buying way more than the first one, and this is one of Valve's greatest gaming achievements. Not only as a game, but as an experience - this one can literally change substantially each time you play, while the first one only has subtle changes that don't directly affect gameplay greatly. This is one of my favorite zombie games ever made, if not my favorite."
jdogginess,"May 27, 2011",9,"Multiplayer!  cooperative or competitive!  Teamwork actually means something here.  You can do more than just shoot guns.  Controlling special abilitied Zombies is a unique experience.  To call this a first person shooter almost seems like an insult because it has more different qualities than nearly all other hogwash coming down the pipe.  Not incredibly different from L4D1, but a few new special infected and melee weapons and **** worth it.  Lots of polish, lots of fun...online scavenge mode rocks!  You not only feel like a member of your team, you need to be and they need to be yours or your brains will get eaten.  Bottom line...possibly the best teamwork oriented game ever, certainly the best with a still thriving community."
Altair,"May 21, 2011",9,"This is one of the best game ever. Plenty of fun with friends and a very enjoyable versus mode. The coop system is the best ever seen in the games history. The animations are incredibly fluid, some of the best I've seen so far in a game. The dialogues are great, the characters say a lot of different things and are never annoying or ripetitive. Definitely a masterpiece!"
DWlubu1998,"May 2, 2011",9,"This was a GREAT game has everything you could want guns, funny characters, and ZOMBIES just go out and buy it and you wont regret it. Graphics are great the sounds and music make it a scary and enjoyable experience. I would recommended this to anyone who is looking for a zombie game with a good campain, good humor and just a good time."
starmario123,"Apr 27, 2011",9,9/10 = Amazing = Addictive and very well designed shooter. Some of the best Co-op and versus action you can possibly find on console.
GreenSkipper,"Apr 5, 2011",8,"6 Word Review from Familiar Fan: Has replay value with laughable flaws. IF you're a fan familiar with the Left 4 Dead series, it's almost like playing Left 4 Dead again, but there are differences in Left 4 Dead 2. One big difference is that you shove is limited down from the last game. After a certain number of shoves, you can't shove anymore. If you desired weapon diversity and new Special Infected, that has been added. The two biggest flaws, might be different for each person, I have with this game is two things: very stupid AI and poor fun with AI. The AI is very stupid, often so much so that it can be game changing (you may not have to deal with AI, but I do since I don't have Live. I often experience these problems with the AI in Co-op Campaign). Often times, AI will change from pistol to tier weapons at the worlds worst and weirdest time. AI also has a tendency to stay silent about hidden items, such as: better weapons, Pills, and First Aid. If you have live capabilities, your experience may be different from mine."
Iron_Mal,"Dec 19, 2010",7,"When I first heard about L4D2 I was skeptical and thought that it could have just as easily been DLC or an expansion pack that just added a few extra campaigns and some new weapons/enemies.

It turns out that I was 100% right on this one, it's still Left 4 Dead (just as we know and love it), it just has...some extra crap thrown in to try and mix it up a bit (which it sorta does for a bit).

The difficulty has gone up since the last game, although not always in the ways that veterans of the original would hope, (AI that will cheerfully ignore your pleas for aid as you have your kidneys being ripped out right next to them being something that I am still a bit sore about), sometimes the added challenge adds to the experience but more often than not it just strikes you as the game being petty and childish (was it really necessary to spawn five Chargers in the space of three minutes?).

I guess my overall opinion is that if you liked Left 4 Dead then you'll like Left 4 Dead 2 because it's just more of the same with a slightly different colour palette and somewhat contrived anti-camping measures."
SamHandwich,"Dec 18, 2010",7,"I played countless hours of L4D 1 and loved every minute of it. The second installment introduces new features, game modes and characters to go along with the new levels and it's certainly more L4D goodness. The levels are more open and the AI director keeps the pressure on where the first game felt more directed and varied in pace, there are also more elaborate set pieces which to crop up half way through chapters as well as at the end. The controls are still the fastest and most crisp of any console FPS, suiting the fast pace of the game.

But something has taken the shine off it this time around, perhaps the characters and the locale don't ring the same zombie movie bells and the level design doesn't lend itself to keeping a tight team. Or maybe it's just that the excitingly team co-op gameplay from the first game isn't so new here. Either way I'm happy that I parted with the cash as it's still good and Valve deserve our support for their contribution to gaming in general.

Now how about a single player game using the same IP?"
alfieboi13,"Nov 22, 2010",10,"Firstly, this is way better than the original. The characters are funnier, the fighting is better, and the game is harder. But not harder in an off putting way though, harder in a way which makes you just want to kick ass. Plus the game is actually intelligent, in that if you seem to be struggling with your path of progression it can actually change to adapt to your skill level so repeat plays can make a completely different experience increasing the playability.

The melee weapons are the big new thing about L4D2. Killing the undead with a guitar is surprisingly fun, although I must admit the fun of hacking and slashing your way through the hoard does wear off slightly, and you'll probably find yourself switching back to your gun often. By far my favourites are the axe and the chainsaw. The chainsaw especially when used again the witches. They were the one special zombie which caused me no end of deaths in the original L4D, so the satisfaction of bringing one down alone in five seconds flat is extremely fun.

The special zombies are much more common in the sequel (or at least I noticed them more). The new ones are Spitters (My mortal enemy) who spew out pools of acid which are deathly if you stroll into one; Jockeys, which take control of your movement; and Chargers, who are like mini tanks but much, much easier to kill. Of course, the witches and tanks are still there in full force, along with the Boomers, Hunters and Smokers ready to massacure you in a split second if you're away from your team mates.

Speaking of team mates, L4D2 is very much a co-op game, and is really at its most enjoyable when played with a friend (or three). Team work really is essential when the zombies start swarming you, and to help you find ammunition and all the good weapons. It's encouraged further with the addition of a defibrillator kit to revive dying team mates, plus rooms which you have to locate to revive dead team mates (and there's nothing as annoying as sitting back while your team mates refuse to find the door because they're on a roll, but then on the up side, you can vote to kick them).

Mind you, all that team mate stuff goes out the door in the online versus games, when four of you are the survivors and four of you are trying to annihilate them ruthlessly. Probably better played with strangers, since you will fall out. A lot. Especially when they start teaming up on the weak one. Which is usually me.

A little note about the AI characters here. They're crap. I wouldn't like to play the game solo on a hard difficulty because the AI characters have stopped being as good as they were in the original and started being incredibly dumb. They'll revive and heal you sometimes, but I found they shoot less and get hurt more and sometimes even leave you to die while they go off and save their own sorry asses. And that's just not cool. The AI is the only thing about the game where the original L4D has the edge.

As well as Versus and Campaign mode, you can also play Survival and Scavenge, which are shorter and more competitive (if you can get more competitive than Versus). Survival sees you battling to stay alive for as long as possible against swarming hoards, and with no chance of escape it really does come down to who lasts the longest. Great way to get used to using the weapons, but it does get a little old quickly. Scavenge mode has more replayability as you can play as survivors trying to collect gas tanks to fill up a generator and thus add time to keep a rapid clock counting down going, or as the infected trying to stop them. Again, you'll probably fall out by the end. But in a fun way.

Overall, this a game I'll be recommending. If you liked the original, you'll like this even better, it's a much more rounded game and although the same could've probably been achieved with a couple of expansion packs, that wouldn't have been half as satisfying. If you're new to the series then buy this instead of the first one."
hydeks,"Nov 21, 2010",9,"If you loved the first game you'll love this one too. New people, some new weapons, able to carry and use melee wepaons, more campaigns, longer game, tons of fun."
spazzinmekon,"Nov 17, 2010",10,"This game right here is the pretty much the only reason why i even buy the ridiculous price to play online, LOVE THIS GAME. love the 1 as well. I like how this game has more levels with actually light given L4D1 was pretty much a dark setting that whole time. I mean this game is just fun, shooting zombies with Ellis all day, does it really get any better than that?"
TheKingZombie,"Oct 25, 2010",8,This is a highly addictive game.  Yes you will lose interest after a while but add some friends and turn it to hard and guess what... I new found fun time... Anyone who gives this game lower than an 8 must not have any friends to play with... Multi player or multi player VS. is where this game shines!
mrcritic,"Sep 24, 2010",10,"I'm not what you would call a ""video game person"", yet after playing this once, I've been obsessed with this game. Much better than the sequel, and the three extra infected characters are definitely worth the time. Even more weapons, plus even more zombies equals a hell of a time!"
ArkonBlade,"Sep 3, 2010",4,pretty much like the first one only things improved is lots of melee wepons and the graphics look like they actaully belong on the 360 instead of the original xbox. thats about it its just as repetetive as the first.  no story charicters are annoying and lame . its still to short abit longer then the first one though. again still shoulda been a budget title . i didnt expect any thing from this game and thats what i got . makes me glad i just rented it. if you loved the first you will probubly like this one as long as you didnt set your hopes high there was gona be much of a improvement . otherwsie at best rent it and forget about it.
Review9,"Aug 29, 2010",8,"Left 4 dead 2 is a very fun game. Nothing beats taking out zombies with a baseball bat, but doing it on the same maps gets very old. Don't get me wrong i like this game it's just since there's only like 6 maps it does get old. They did come out with the passing but it ****. I hear there's another add on coming out but i will not be getting it cause i traded mine in for Bad company 2. The characters are brilliant and so is this game. It's just the same 6 maps do get old. I give it a 8 out of 10"
