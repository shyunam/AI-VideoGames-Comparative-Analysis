Aldaruk,"Jun 24, 2024",10,"It's wonderful that Naughty Dog has once again portrayed amazing gameplay coupled with the most profound storytelling I have ever seen. The Last of Us Part II is not a story of revenge as many people see it; it's a story of forgiveness, and how revenge and the cycle of violence will mentally and physically damage every party involved."

Reysinnombree,"Jun 19, 2024",10,"Crudo y viceral como la vida misma. Me encanto que el juego no apesta a testosterona y es una visión femenina sobre el caos y la venganza.

Mi juego favorito de PS4 sin duda alguna! Gracias naughty dog por darle visibilidad a la comunidad LGBI y por crear historias reales."
jobomb,"Jun 19, 2024",3,"Solid step up in gameplay mechanics and the graphics are amazing. But the writing is just the biggest let down, and the theme is in complete disconnect with the gameplay and direction. You can't make a game about ""violence am bad!"" and then make an on the rails experience that is purely murdering everyone you come across. There's a stealth mechanic in the game, but instead of exploring the theme of ""VIOLENCE AM BAD!"" as the player and maybe trying to avoid conflict as much as possible, most of the game requires you to brutally kill people and the stealth mechanics just enhance that. It's crap direction and the writing is awful."

JackGilbert,"Jun 15, 2024",10,"I absolutely love this game. The gameplay and aesthetic build upon the first and are absolutely phenomenal.

ifi_kont,"Jun 12, 2024",9,Nomatter what other people say this game is **** it is very sad but something that people dont understand is that because something is sad it doesn't mean that is **** game makes you think and gives you  many imporntant messages about life (like for examle to always look at both sides of the coin). The reason why you can receive so many things from this game is the same reason why it is sad; because it is a REALISTIC game which is based on the trauma that someone is going through and the way of healing from it. Overall it is one of the best games that i have ever played for a lot of reasons. Only thing that ia would change is that i would like to  play a bit less as Abby.

KScyther,"Jun 10, 2024",8,"Overall great game. I liked the character of abby, after giving it a thought. However myonly reason for not giving it 10 is mainly because ellie's sexual orientation. Its just weird to like her. Its so weird two girls making out, it takes away her identity of being potrayed as a strong female."
yezwi,"Jun 9, 2024",10,"Una buena secuela diga lo que se diga siento que la forma en la q transcurre la historia es perfect el punto bajo q le veo al juego es que no termino de empatizar con abby aun viendo todo por lo que paso para mi no me llego a conectar tanto con el personaje, despues en ambientacion escenarios y graficos musica es el punto fuerte del juego no decepciona en casi nada y el final con el flashback de joel es cine puro 10/10"

LitoPerezito,"Jun 2, 2024",10,"Even though I admit I would've preferred this game's story to be all about Ellie and Joel's next journey, I can't help but love this game.
The bond they created throughout the first game is what makes it so special to me, and left me wanting more, so this sequel broke my heart in a million pieces the first time I played it.

Fortunately, this sequel still offers some moments of them together, but emotionally, the game will take from you more than it'll give you.
 
Either you love or hate where the story of this sequel goes, you have to admit it's a masterpiece. The amount of work the team put into this game is crazy. I'm going through it again for the third time, readying myself for another 24 hour playthrough. The first hours still breaks my heart and hurts like hell, but exploring and surviving the world of The Last of Us Part II feels great no matter how many times I replay it. 

The characters, the writing, the graphics, music and sound design borders perfection, and makes every single hour spent playing this game be worth it."

Coopaloop99,"May 20, 2024",1,"The gameplay and sound design are top notch. The writing is surprisingly awful considering how great the first game is. Infected in this game are an afterthought.

PineconeEsque,"May 6, 2024",10,"Improves on the gameplay of part 1 significantly, the combat scenarios are excellent, and the gameplay is much smoother.

As for the story, controversial, but they needed to go hard, as part 1 didn't need a sequel, and had a great ending. They nailed the story, and in my opinion made a game that succeeded the original."
Ruften,"May 5, 2024",0,Killing the main character in the most worthless way possible. Insert strong independent female character. The story looks more like a teenage reality tv episode.

Fawlcon,"Apr 29, 2024",2,"Good to great gameplay.  Horrible over-the-top violence, no one to like or root for.  People with no moral compass might like being led through a narrow story, but not me.  Looking back, this is DEI.  Meaning, that developers want to show a STRONG female protagonist, ambiguous morality, and tell the stories THEY want to tell without letting the players have input.  Almost all developers are uber-liberal, however, the good ones still respect the player base who do not have the same worldview.  Sure the story can end the way the writers want, but good writing can give you different moral paths to get there.  BG3 is the pinnacle of this."

LukeTilley,"Apr 21, 2024",6,The Last Of Us Part 2 has ideas in the game that could have been great but are ruined by poor execution and a wonky drag paced structure while having some beautiful moments and eye pleasing visuals to save it from falling in the dumpster.
Beautifulyinsan,"Apr 19, 2024",10,"its polarizing, it was much more high brow then I expected, but equally worth my time which is great because the time can be double what the first games is. where the first game I would leave with a good 15 hour adventure that hit me hard enough to become my 6th favorite game of all time. here It took me a pretty beefing, and visaral adventure of 27 hours. and I don't think I got wasted, and I'm gonna elaborate on why I said ""high brow"". this story is intimidating to say the least, it has so much to it. the dual character perspective, the large amount characters that are all completely individualized meaning that they are all emotionally complex, and the story also forcing you to value every little detail of how these character really, REALLY would start to loss there sanity. It values the most detailed and purposeful detail that it either. 1, becomes one of the most brutal modern stories of the current era, or 2 is an absolute mess and is a dog that should have been put out of its misery. bad pun, sorry. but that's what this game's big catch of this game that will make or break your play, the story, where the gameplay is just as brilliantly designed, tight and creative, along with some very interesting dynamic combat changes, like Smarter enemies and proning. I will say though, if you are patient and look even deeper then others, you will be honestly proud of your experiance. its just not gonna be easy like it was for me."
Jimcarrey90,"Apr 19, 2024",0,"I think the game got lost with Joel's relationship with Elie, in The Last of Us 1 is very well explained, 2 adding a villain out of nowhere and not building Joel and Ellie anymore, it destroyed an incredible game"

Hydrochoos,"Apr 19, 2024",3,"Honestly, I hate the game. It's not fun at all, it's like work. I don't need anything like that in my free time. Completely contrary to the first part, a shame :("
Epico,"Apr 18, 2024",4,"TLOU is in the top five of my favourite video games of all time, and has a special place in my heart. It's no wonder then that the narrative is particularly important to my experience when expecting the same plot twists and dramatic tones. There's something wrong about the way the story is told, to be more precise its experimental structure that failed miserably. I also didn't appreciate the melodramatic way of conveying a simple message ad nauseum just so that the ending feels redundant and sprinkled with hipocrisy. Also weighing it down is a level design that has moments where it seems bloated, and puzzles that border on mediocrity at times. The only reason I can give it this grade is because the gameplay still manages to be brutally entertaining, and there have certainly been some improvements compared to the first instalment."

akurmy2,"Apr 4, 2024",3,"The pacing and storyline are terrible. The game was a major major disappointment over the First part. The first part was so good that I always reminisce the very first time I got to play the first part of this franchise. Had high hopes from this sequel. But. To be plainly blunt, it fell flat on its face. And the disappointment for me doesn't stem merely from Joel's death and the inability to play him. I don't also have an iota of problem with the LGBTQ narrative pushed by the game, though at times it is a bit annoying. The main problem with the game is its terrible pacing, lack of interesting and memorable characters, bad overall storyline and non-believable moments. Could have given it a 4 but giving it a 3 because it just **** the very high hopes I had from this sequel because of the first part."

Thrasher19,"Apr 1, 2024",10,"An absolut masterpiece and probably the best story driven videogame made so far. The characters all follow their motivations in believebel ways and the writers didn't shy back from the inevitable consequences their decisions bring with them. The acting is impeccable and the grafics are some of the best you can expect from this generation of gaming. Don't miss out on this game because of the mixed user reviews. The negative reviews are absolutely underserved and written by people who can't appreciate honest writing and prefer stories that go exactly the way they expect. NaughtyDog has done an incredible work here and has done so much for videogaming as a storytelling media. If you're not sensitive to difficult topics and demonstration of violence in games, this is an absolute must play for you."

FKa192,"Mar 14, 2024",10,"Um dos melhores, senão o melhor jogo já feito. Ele faz com que a coragem do diretor no final do primeiro jogo pareça algo até mesmo infantil, pois os assuntos e a maturidade com que os temas são tratados aqui são distintos de tudo o mais que se possa ver em qualquer mídia da atualidade. Gráficos formosos, hinos no lugar de trilhas sonoras, a melhor captura de movimentos da indústria, personagens marcantes, enredo corajoso e uma jogabilidade tão boa quanto a do primeiro fazem dele o jogo mais marcante que já joguei. Só jogue se você não estiver a procura de vilões a quem culpar e estiver buscando uma experiência do que é o ser humano verdadeiramente nos seus limites e dilemas. 
Ponto negativo vai para a gameplay que pouco de diversifica durante a longa jornada do jogo.
Diferente do anterior não espere uma jornada sobre amor, aqui, o tema é o ódio, então se prepare para o penar."

But I can assure you once you beat it you'll feel empty because there is no other game like it.

The mechanics are a work of art, the actors gave it their all, the graphical fidelity is uncanny.

If you see a review that says ""woke"" ""agenda"" ""SJW"" or the like, you can pretty much disregard it knowing the user who posted that review is just being emotional.

Ironic, isn't it, that this game is so divisive to gamers (some so very EXTREME) when its narrative is set in a warring faction-filled post apocalyptic world... play it - the reality of their world rings true to ours... doesn't it?"

This game shows that revenge at all cost can't bring you nothing good and only pain and suffer this game is not for everyone it's like great movie but with hard ending and story that you need to think about and then you start to apriciate that kind of media
DarthKirby,"Mar 12, 2024",4,"This game has many problems the biggest one being it didn’t need to be made. The first game has a great ambiguous ending and this game ruins that. Gameplay is fine but nothing special and the story has terrible pacing issues and the story has some truly weird and bad choices. Graphics wise it looks great, in fact one of the best looking games ever made but eye candy won’t make up for the fact the story is bad and the gameplay is mediocre."

GamerPulse,"Mar 2, 2024",10,"Title: An Unforgettable Journey Through the Apocalypse: The Last of Us Part II Review

The Last of Us Part II, developed by Naughty Dog and released for the PlayStation 4, is not just a game; it's a monumental achievement in storytelling, gameplay, and emotional depth. This sequel to the critically acclaimed The Last of Us pushes the boundaries of video games as a medium for narrative, delivering a complex, heart-wrenching story that explores themes of revenge, grief, and the consequences of our choices.

From the outset, The Last of Us Part II immerses players in a beautifully crafted post-apocalyptic world that is both breathtaking and haunting. The attention to detail in the environments is staggering, from the overgrown urban landscapes of Seattle to the serene yet sinister forests. The game's visual storytelling is complemented by its use of light, shadow, and weather, creating a world that feels alive and incredibly immersive.

The gameplay in The Last of Us Part II is a masterful evolution of the first game's mechanics. Combat is intense and requires strategic thinking, blending stealth and action in a way that feels both challenging and rewarding. The game introduces new enemies and obstacles, requiring players to adapt and think creatively. The crafting and upgrade systems are refined, allowing for a greater sense of progression and customization.

However, where The Last of Us Part II truly shines is in its story and character development. The narrative is bold and unafraid to confront the player with difficult questions about humanity, morality, and the cycle of violence. The game's dual perspectives story, focusing on both Ellie and Abby, is a narrative gamble that pays off, offering a nuanced exploration of its themes and characters. The performances of the voice actors bring these characters to life with incredible depth and emotion, making their journeys feel intensely personal.

The Last of Us Part II also excels in its sound design and musical score. Gustavo Santaolalla returns to deliver another hauntingly beautiful soundtrack that perfectly captures the emotional tone of the game. The sound design adds to the immersion, with every environment filled with sounds that enhance the sense of place and the tension of the gameplay.

One of the most commendable aspects of The Last of Us Part II is its commitment to inclusivity and accessibility. The game features an extensive array of accessibility options, ensuring that players of all abilities can experience the story and gameplay. This commitment to inclusivity is a testament to Naughty Dog's dedication to the gaming community.

In conclusion, The Last of Us Part II is a masterpiece that transcends the medium of video games. It is a deeply emotional, thought-provoking, and unforgettable experience that challenges players to consider the depths of human emotion and the complexities of moral ambiguity. With its stunning visuals, innovative gameplay, and profound narrative, The Last of Us Part II sets a new benchmark for what video games can achieve in storytelling and emotional engagement. It is an essential experience for anyone who values the power of storytelling in games, and a testament to the artistic capabilities of the medium."
nic0307,"Mar 1, 2024",3,"I tried my best to play through the game. The relationship between the girls wasn't really an issue for me but the story was forgetful and a little tedious.
The gameplay loop for Ellie is so slow and repetitiveand boring. Area. ... stealth...wait...stealth kill..wait...maybe another cut scene.
As a stand alone game it's poor. Gameplay ****. Story is bland and pc and boring and tiring and dark.
So many better games than this nowadays. Even if played through is no fun to play.
TLOU 1 story is touching and gameplay ok for its day...this is a over a decade later and still using tired mechanics. At best ...Graphics are ok (but days gone etc are better!)"
OMNIS7ASH,"Mar 1, 2024",5,"Ok as a gamer with experience of over 35 years i will try to be as fair as possible. 
The game is good as a game. Graphics, gameplay, music etc. I would say great. 
Unfortunately there is the other side of the coin which is the story, characters and the political and woke agenda that was best if had stayed off this game. I understand some people doesnt mind these since game looks and plays great, but as a gamer with respect to myself and to the hard work that been putted in this game i cannot say its perfect but not bad either. Its just an average in total and it would have been better if the person who make the game just quit making games or at least characters and story for games. We dont want politics and woke agendas in our video games, nor a mediocre story that eventually got butchered with the worst way possible (on purpose maybe?). The game could EASILY stand at 10/10 if some things were made right. Im curious to see how part 3 will end next."
ChipiChapa10,"Feb 29, 2024",3,"The story is awful. As people said it before, and how the rating shows, its and awful, bad story. Written by a child in an adult body that didn't get his favorite toy from the shop. This is not part of the The Last of Us series for me. Gameplay got better, the graphics are better only the story guy, whose name should remain secret, (google it im not saying his name out) he ruined this franchise. NOBODY liked the story. How on earth people nodded for this ****? wtf. *Sarcams* I'm really waiting for part 2 hope the story will be just as great as in part 1!"

If you still want to buy this game and support people who said fake info, and lied to our face then let me tell you this with no spoilers: You order a sandwich because you liked it yesterday. They tell you in the ads its really good, and its even with tomato now, but when you order it, and try it out, they remove the whole sandwich and you have to eat the sandwich with bun and ketchup and **** and onions only. And they say this is how it goes."

MajinRa,"Feb 21, 2024",3,"The first bit of the game isn't all that terrible. About 40% into the game, it just falls apart. The characters are mostly forgettable after that point. The characters from the first game that make into this game are decent but all the newer characters lack depth or a reason to care about them. I couldn't care less about the second half of the story. It would have been better if the game just ended halfway through instead of the game making you play the majority of the second half. There's no payoff at the end that warrants the pain/hurt the characters (and you) feel in the first half. This felt like a rushed fever dream **** with greedy people just trying to make a game that rides off the coattails of the first game that was a masterpiece (and they know it) that unfortunately this game came no where near to being as good as. I'd avoid this game, especially if you have to pay for it, unless you have 20 to 26 hours of your life that you're just trying to throw away."

dapren22,"Feb 12, 2024",4,"I think in terms of the game itself, this is a 10/10. The graphics, gameplay mechanics and general feel is unbelievably good. For me personally, where this game falls short is the story, pushing real world political agenda's into games has always been one of my pet peeves, swapping out a hero because of their gender or sexual orientation, then pushing agenda's throughout the story, I got a bit sick of it after a while. By the end of the game, I felt like I just sat through a feminist seminar that I involuntarily attended. I don't have a problem with anyone's race, gender or sexual orientation, but I am a strong believer, in using that where it suits the story, such as Cyberpunk 2077, which done it perfectly, this game however, did not, it felt like bringing in a bunch of feminist views into a zombie world, something I cared little for. I will however note, the game itself is fantastic, and I am a huge Naughty Dog fan of everything they do, this game however, is just not for me.

TLDR:

Game itself: 10/10
Political agenda's hidden within: 1/10"

OgnistyKamilek,"Feb 10, 2024",10,"""I'm scared of ending up alone.""

Just as I considered the first part of the series to be a good game, worth playing, the second part took my breath away. The plot is amazing, bold and emotional. We are presented with two perspectives that at first seem to be black and white, two opposites. However, we can quickly come to the conclusion that these perspectives are exactly the same. Both sides pursue revenge that is blind and devastating, not only for the heroes but also for those around them.

Personally, I don't understand how shallow an approach you have to have to rate the game as low as some people do. I also do not understand the threats directed against actress Jocelyn Mettler - this is not shallow behavior, but simply evil. Ultimately, I hope that people will appreciate some other, perhaps risky, approaches and thus open their minds to something else. Because if they accumulate emotions while playing and blurt them out so rudely, then what is going on in their lives."

AD1212,"Feb 9, 2024",7,"I was never a big fan of the first TLOU. I did not hate it but it wasn't the ""best game ever"" that people made it out to be. But I still enjoyed it regardless. TLOU 2 has good gameplay and fun combat mechanics and the stealth is way more refined. The problem with TLOU 2 is that you rarely actually play it. You spend most of the time watching long drawn out cutscenes or just walking in a straight line side by side with another NPC talking about pointless nonsense for 40 minutes untill you can go back to sneaking around stealth killing bandits and infected. Once you get around to playing Abby the game takes a huge nosedive. Abby is a pointless character who only exists to drive some convoluted moral of the story that revenge is bad. Everything the characters do in this game is pointless and illogical just for the sake of shock value. They made Joel the bad guy for no real reason. 

when you look past the terrible contradicting story and narrative TLOU2 is a solid 3rd person action stealth game with some refined survival elements but the story and the constant cutscenes brings it down. I'm not against games having good story telling, cutscenes or having a message but there's such a thing as too much. It's hard to enjoy the gameplay when you can't play a game for more than an hour without having to watch an hours worth of lame cutscenes that draw out way too long."

rben576,"Feb 8, 2024",2,"I give it 2 instead of 1 (or 0) because I liked the game mechanics,  the graphics, most parts of the world created and I appreciate the effort the developers clearly put into the game.
I loved the first game, it's probably my favorite game of all times, inversely the second game is the biggest disappointment a game ever caused me. I could write a lot of specific things about the story and about general concepts they have, but it doesn't worth my time. 
The story is terrible, it's loaded with far left liberal bs. There are lesbians (fine by me, but in this kind of world definitely not advantageous for a family), a trans (how exactly?! much more disadvantageous), woman with the physics of Dwayne The Rock Johnson (again how tf?!, not like you have a lot of steroids to spare in a zombie apocalypse), mindless **** old guy (because that's what those are, who does not support lesbians in an apocalypse right? :) ), stupid religious cult, that does not support trans people (like those religious people irl right? :) ).
The game disrespects the player several times, but I don't want to get into spoilers. There is an interesting theme all along about revenge, grief and forgiveness, but the game conveys these themes with a confusing, sometimes chaotic story that jumps all around space and time with strongly varying quality and detail.
If you loved the first game I strongly suggest you give this game a pass.
All that said, because of my love of the first game and the interesting world they created I would give a shot to a third Last of Us game."

I've played for over 100 hours, finishing it on the ultimate difficulty + permadeath just to give that sense of cardiac arrest again, and it was just as amazing as the first time. This game is sensational, and by the time it ends, you will cry and wish there was more to it. Naughty Dog did it again, no wonder it got GOTY. Don't be scared by the User ratings, they are simply from casual gamers that don't appreciate a great story telling and character development. Best game of the decade for me."

A nivel narrativo The Last of Us Part II toma una decisión valiente pero arriesgada y es salirse de la zona de confort sobre como debe ser una secuela debido que tiene los pantalones de sacrificar cosas en el camino, controlar un personaje que sabe que ha muchos jugadores lo odiarán, pero todo esto en función de enseñarnos la otra cara de la moneda, todo esto por medio del deuteragonista de esta entrega,  todo esto para que el espectador observé que aquí no hay blanco y negro, simplemente existe el gris, la manera que está narrada la historia es para contar el tema principal del juego, la venganza. 
The Last of Us Part II es una historia que habla sobre  el ciclo de la violencia, la crudeza, la rendencion y el perdón."

ShoeiTheGreat,"Jan 23, 2024",8,"Yeah, most over hated piece of media ever. Look, it’s not perfect and nowhere near it’s predecessor, but it’s still great. My flaws with it are obviously Joel’s death going against his character but other than that the game is great and narratively, his death works, it just ruined his character which does **** also do dislike having to play as Abby. Everything with Ellie is great and people misinterpret her letting Abby go. She realizes the stupidity of what she has done and what she is doing. It’s a pretty common trope that people for some reason hate in this game. I don’t know, I loved it…"

PetyaKenig,"Jan 18, 2024",10,"Игра до ужаса отличается от первой части. ЭТО СОВСЕМ ДРУГИЕ ИГРЫ. Человек придумывавший эту развязку с первой по вторую часть, реально гениален. Он мог сделать вторую часть про других персонажей, с таким же сюжетом, тогда бы он получил аналог 1 части игры ( по полученным эмоциям ), но он рискнул всей франшизой игры, потому что смог показать любимых и ненавистных персонажей не с той стороны. И самое главное - он смог донести идею и смысл всех похождений, которую все поняли. Для нетерпеливых - (СПОЙЛЕР:Уметь прощать.)
Я бы выставил этой игре оценку 10/10, не смотря на жесткие дыры в сюжете в некоторых моментах, на УЖАСНЕЙШИЕ диалоги Элли с ее друзьями (ужасно кринжевал, ну никто так не разговаривает, их диалог похож на диалог друзей, которые дружат дня 2-3, и не знают о чем поговорить), и даже не смотря на ЛГБТ, которая в принципе и убила оценку на метакритике.
ОЧЕНЬ. РАСТЯНУТАЯ. ИГРА.
Сделали очень много интерьеров? Но половина из них похожи друг на друга.
Много экшена? 70% экшена высосано из пальца.
Хорошая связка геймплея и кат-сцен? Половина игры состоит из кат-сцен, без спору, они прекрасны, они строят сюжет. Но из остальной половины геймплея - 35% игры это скучная бродилка в поисках ресов, решения загадок. Лично я проходил игру ночью перед сном, и меня эта постоянная бродилка убивала в сон. Мой рекорд по лазаньям в этих интерьерах - около 3 часов ( без продвижения по сюжету ).
Также я не понимаю построения отношений в этой игре. У Элли - ненастоящие отношения. Там прямо чувствуется какая то натянутость за уши. Какое то проявление начинается только в конце, НО ТАМ ПРОЯВЛЕНИЕ МАКСИМУМ МИНУТ 15. Почему ГГ получил настолько слабую проработку в этом аспекте - не понятно, введь из прошлой части чувствовалось как Элли имеет привязанность и симпатию к близким людям.
МИНИ-СПОЙЛЕРЫ, СЮЖЕТ НЕ ПАЛЮ, НО ИМЕЕТСЯ ПАРУ ОПАСНОСТЕЙ!! ( Внизу есть конец спойлера):
К Эбби вопросов нет, ее диалоги простроены довольно сильно, любовные отношения сделаны как нужно. ( Любовные отношения Эбби - имба. там реально показана реальность отношений, а не вот этот насморк, что у Элли )
Концовка тоже подтянута за уши, не верится что она бы получилась такой, если была бы только история Элли.Если смотреть только историю Элли, эта концовка была бы вообще нелогичной. 
КОНЕЦ СПОЙЛЕРА!!!!!!!!!!!.
Ну а так, игра прекрасна, не шедевр, но заставляет подумать. Концовка вообще вывела меня на кучу эмоций, как и задумывали авторы. Получить столько разных эмоций всего за 1 игровой момент, я не смог ни в одной игре. От агрессии до понимания. 
Надеемся, ждем, что Last Of Us 3 выйдет менее рискованной чем вторая часть, и более запоминающиеся чем первая."

I really wanted that same emotional investment that I had with Part 1, but the writers chose shock value over good writing. The story is poorly executed in what it is trying to convey and it forces me to accept that certain characters have to act stupid when in reality it’s only done for the convenience of the plot. There are other characters that start off extremely unlikeable and the writers force you to like them through cheap manipulation tactics like petting dogs or showing us flashbacks during peaceful times with friends while not making them acknowledge their current misdeeds. I really wanted to like this game because the graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is fun, but if I’m skipping cutscenes **** that is so heavily dependent on its story, that’s not a good thing. Neil Druckmann and his writing team truly dropped the ball on this one and my interest in the eventual third game is minuscule at best."

Without any doubts, this game has always been iconic for many players all over the world and its characters have become our nears. But still from my point of view, it’s absolutely the creators’ right to decide what the plot and the characters’ fates will be.
Frankly speaking, this game has broken my heart, and though there is always space for improvement, I call this game a “masterpiece”.

Gustavo Santaolalla and Neil Druchmann for their

JeannWagmaker,"Dec 25, 2023",0,"The gameplay, setting, progression and soundtrack are the most impressive you'll find in a game, but it's not worth the absurd script failure.

There is nothing anyone can say that makes sense of Joel's decision to tell his real name to a stranger -- after more than 20 years of experience in a cruel world, full of terrible people, having killed so many whose acquaintances would love to see him dead.

Just as there is no sense in Ellie's decision to have killed so many, abandon her family to obtain the revenge that absolutely everyone wanted and, in the end, save the person she was supposed to kill and who caused so much disgrace to everyone she loved.

All of these flaws are only justified if you, as a writer, wanted the story to be about an empowered woman replacing the cis straight white man, but anyone who has played both games knows that in no alternate universe would that woman beat Joel.

This game was a mistake. An error that showed how a bad script can ruin a game whose other aspects are exceptional."

WPReviews,"Dec 22, 2023",7,"Story:
The Story is filled with a rollercoaster full of emotions. From the expectations of wanting to see Joel and Ellie, you get Abby who is a karma of the main protagonist of the 1st game. This Story is a winner takes all by focusing on other point of views of Npc characters with the reason of action with few consequences. The pacing is all over the place to the point you would get even more frustrated on a recent shocking death instead of focusing on the story. The game tries to make a point without trying to flow things out nicely for the player to understand their intentions. It generally feels like a reenactment of the first game with Abby and ###. You will see later on.

Gameplay:
Gameplay is highly detailed and highly realistic than any other game you would see in your life. This game really makes you feel like a survivor on the edge of the apocalypse 24/7.

Guns:
The weapons feel realistic to the shooting and towards the attachments. You really feel the heavy impact of shooting a weapon from Ellie/Abby hands throughout the story. Even a bow and arrow feels realistic to shoot in this game.

Workbench:
You can interact head to toe in upgrading your weapon. Watching each attachment/upgrade be implemented into your weapon, making you a killing machine next chapter. Try not to get too absorbed because the workbenchp you work on may be interrupted and become your final place to be alive,  since even danger can lurk in any corner.

Looting/Interactive:
You can really see the characters open drawers and loot corpses and place it inside their actual backpack. You can see the strands of hair get messy in tense moments with these character. You can get wet from head to toe, from your equipment to your clothes, you can even get muddy/dirty if you move in the ground alot. You can see the realisticnes to the environment, to the actual pupils of the character when in combat and out.

A.I:
The A.I is so intelligent it places other games to shame. To knowing when you run out of ammo, To coming up with strategies to ambush you when you are too focused and distracted. They can even call for each other names to check if they are alright, like dolphins using sonar to bounce back and forth to each other. They feel intense fear when alone, and start to form groups to search for you. What **** is they don't surrender or run away for reinforcements. They will even cry out when they see their friends die in front of them. Truly the experience of details to make you feel something when killing them. Close to the realism of arkham knight npc behavior, that is no easy feat.

Infected:
They are more interactive with the environment and bigger infected actual strategies on how to rush and kill you, they will even observe you before destroying everything in their way to get to you. Truly a big step from last game.

Why a 7/10:
I find this to be a message that wasn't thought out too much for the player base. Since I find it to be said that everyone dies. I care less for the message, but I felt it could have been given to any character. I felt like it took itself to seriously when it is suppost to be a video game people just want to have fun on. It's unnecessary issues for something that could of been an easy 10/10 game, to all just prove a point that not even obvious to gamers that have none of that mindset on why they play games. No idea who this was suppost to teach. I find that heavily stupid. surprisingly I never thought I would say that to a naughty dog game. Still in shock why the pacing was this bad. Hopefully next game will patch things up."

deltanine,"Dec 19, 2023",0,"This is the next Metroid Other M.  It is a pinaccle of giant middle fingers to fans of the first game and if Neil Drunkman weren't so egotistical and didn't let Anita Sarkeesian poison his mind, this game wouldn't be as widely hated as it is.  As far as I'm concerned the real reason gaming journalists gave this game all those Game of the Year Awards was to troll the people that criticized the game.  Neil Drunkman had no excuse to kill off Joel within  the first hour of the game.  Remember Resistance 2?  In that game, Nathan Hale had a far more dignified demise.  He did something of value before he died, he died from a swift gunshot to the head, he was killed so that he doesn't become a Chimera monster, and he dies at the end of the game.  In Resistance 3, we play as Hale's killer but we are far more willing to do so, because he was far more sympathetic and he was remorseful for killing Nathan even though he knew it was the lesser of two evils.  Bottom line: Last of Us Part II is an abomination and Neil Drunkman deserves to be fired."
mikciosan,"Dec 18, 2023",8,"Impressive experience - the game improves on every aspect of Last of Us 1. Cutscenes are movie-like, world and characters creations is very believable.

Biggun,"Dec 9, 2023",8,"Sur le plan de la mise en scène du game design du level design des cinématiques de l'IA de l'ambiance le jeu est une masterclass.

real2late,"Dec 9, 2023",9,"I can see why people hate this game. 

I didn't.

I want to start out by saying that this is one of the best looking games I have ever played by far. I had no lags or glitches on a PS4 Pro apart from one time where the Jacket of a Character was invisible for like 20 seconds (And I played this game for about 30 - 40 hours.) 

The Gameplay is fantastic, while there are some points in the game where the game removes your entire inventory it felt great to play this, the only issue I had was that aiming on a controller is still a little difficult for me, as I am a Mouse and Keyboard player.

The Part people hate is the story, after completing the game I know why. I have to agree that some characters, other than the original game, feel flat and could be replaced by other characters without the player noticing. 
This is why I am not rating this a 10/10.

Even for people that already know that they hate this I would still advise you to play this, there are flashbacks where you get some ""extended part one gameplay"" & the game is a lot of fun to play. 

I also want to mention that I payed a total of around 250euros to play this, as I did not own a console before, and I think that this was worth it."
Vishwa_Harsha,"Dec 9, 2023",5,"Top notch game quality wise except that plot is terrible, messed up, incoherent and a failure at the end"
Silent-Heal,"Dec 6, 2023",0,"I wrote a review of this part in the review of the first part. This part is terrible in terms of plot. An outrage to the player, to the script, to common sense. 
I think the scriptwriters of films and games they have some kind of psychological problems, hatred, depression, despair. In most scenarios, they constantly kill all the characters, even the main ones. Disgusting part, disgusting ending, the whole game was a waste. Don't write scripts, go get treatment from a psychologist and stop excruciate people. 
I hope I never see your games, much less buy them. Because of such fools there is nothing to watch anymore.

1st part very quality realistic dramatic game of post-apocalypse time and the start of it. With settings that allow you to play realistic Grounded - tactics stealth action shooter or very simply just shoot everyone and finish the game. But there are slideshows in the game as if the location is loading. The second part, on ps5, is an emotional trap where I think the developer disrespected the fans and did something that should not have been done, and besides, he replaced the plot with a very stupid plot without any connection even to disrespect and cruelty to the fans and that’s why the second part is simply very boring and annoying. The problem began much earlier, in this, the first part, in the DLC, in which they inserted a sick agenda and glued together other episodes as manipulation. If you take my character, the hero, the essence of the series and throw it in the trash, then why and how would I play this game or watch this movie? If you kill Spider-Man, why watch Spider-Man 2 without Spider-Man? This is extremely stupid and cruel. There are tragedies like Titanic with DiCaprio, but it is done correctly and naturally. And in the case of the second part of this game, this, to put it mildly, does not work. The second part is an aggressive, undisguised manipulation, and not a plausible realistic tragedy genre. A shame."

amayu03,"Nov 30, 2023",0,"Title: A Disastrous Sequel That Ruins the Legacy - The Last of Us Part IIRating: ★☆☆☆☆Where do I even begin with The Last of Us Part II? It's a colossal disappointment that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. This sequel is a perfect example of how not to continue a beloved franchise.First and foremost, the story is an absolute trainwreck. It's convoluted, poorly paced, and filled with unnecessary twists and turns that only serve to confuse and frustrate players. The narrative decisions made by the developers seem like they were chosen purely for shock value rather than for the sake of meaningful storytelling. The characters we grew to love in the first game are mishandled and their arcs are completely undermined, leaving players feeling detached and uninvested.Speaking of characters, the new additions to the cast are equally disappointing. Ellie, the strong and relatable protagonist from the original game, is reduced to a one-dimensional revenge-driven character with questionable decision-making skills. The game tries to force players into empathizing with her, but it's hard to sympathize when her actions become increasingly irrational and out of **** gameplay, while solid in the first game, feels clunky and uninspired here. The stealth mechanics are frustratingly inconsistent, often leading to cheap deaths and repetitive encounters. The level design lacks creativity and fails to offer any real sense of exploration. It's a far cry from the immersive and engaging gameplay experience we had in the first **** aspect that cannot be ignored is the game's heavy-handed political agenda. The Last of Us Part II seems more interested in pushing a specific message than in delivering an enjoyable gaming experience. The themes of revenge, violence, and LGBTQ+ representation are forced upon the players, overshadowing any potential for genuine emotional **** top of all these flaws, the technical issues are abundant. The game suffers from frequent frame rate drops, long loading times, and numerous glitches that break immersion and hinder gameplay. It's astonishing that a game of this magnitude could be released with such glaring technical **** conclusion, The Last of Us Part II is a soulless cash grab that tarnishes the legacy of its predecessor. It fails to capture the essence of what made the original game so special and instead delivers a mess of a story, uninspired gameplay, and technical problems. Fans of the first game will be left feeling betrayed, and newcomers will be left wondering what all the hype was about. Save your time and money—this sequel is a disgrace."

Psitivebomthis1,"Nov 23, 2023",0,"Bad writing. Bad story. Bad ending. Rukned the amazing experience that The last of us 1 was for me. Good job. 1/10.They say Joel deserved to die because he killed so many people. Who cares about morality in post apocalyptic game? Guess what, Joel killed for his daughter, just like how abby killed for her father. People can forgive abby but not Joel. That's stupid. Also, if they had even TRIED to make abby empathisable IN THE LEAST or relatable or likable or showed that she had an absolutely legit reason to kill an old and popular character, it would have been understood. But no she just appears from some where and goes, ""I gotta kill him because he killed my father,"" and the player doesn't even get to relate with her pain or her suffering missing her father. You are SUPPOSED to feel bad for her, rather than actually relating with her missing her father and wanting revenge. Morality can f off in this world, unlike how everyone is saying, because its a post apocalypse and everyone will do whatever to survive. In the game as Ellie you also kill a ton of people. Does Ellie deserve to be curbstomped by some guys now?Also, I have seen a bunch of people who claim to have played only the first 4 or 5 hours proudly saying that they like it, and are also criticising players who leave a bad review but have finished the whole game. Automatically discredited. Play the whole game first, then leave a review. Joel isn't properly given the redemption he deserved in this game. Just because some didn't like Joel and left a good review doesn't mean theirs are more valuable than the ones that liked him and have left a negetive one. Leave your own experience. Don't criticise others because they didn't have a similar experience with the characters as you did. Everyone has different sentiments attached to the same game. Calling us angry men because we didn't like what happened with Joel and how his value was drowned over some needless plot channeling is a bad move. Get yourself fixed. Just because you disliked him doesnt mean he deserved to be forgotten and his value diminished after his death. The gamers who liked him and held more worth of him in their hearts deserved a better account of him, and our opinions are just as valuable as yours.I also would like to point out how you think every bad review is a result of review bombing but every good one is legit. Coping much? Next time, make a good game rather than trying to desperately and shamelessly escape criticism after having made a total dumpster fire."

Igl00Man,"Nov 11, 2023",4,"My issues with the Last of Us Part 2 is how the narrative is not good whatsoever. The gameplay is fine, and somewhat better than the first game (which is what is saving it from a grade lower than a 4), but the issues stem with the characterization and story, the strongest points of the previous game. When a game/series with an excellent story has a weak outing in a sequel, it will stand out. Abby's motivations are understandable, but the way it was tied to the first game just feels so hamfisted, and requires too many mental gymnastics to make it work.  It doesn't help that Abby is very impulsive of a character, reckless, and has no issues endangering her friends to get what she wants. Ellie, who's spent her whole life in this apocalypse, makes tons of illogical decisions that don't make sense with someone who has lived through it. She also has some of the same issues as Abby in this game. Joel's death wasn't what it should have been. He should have went out in a blaze of glory, or protecting Ellie, but instead he went out like a punk.  Now, while the characterizations were terrible, the actual protrayals are well performed, and I don't condone those who sent threatening messages to the actors. Sometimes, you need to learn to separate the art from the artist. I don't hate the actors who played these characters, I'm just not a fan of the character they portrayed. I can't recommend this game even at a discount, simply for how hard the narrative drops the ball compared to the first game."

Unfortunately, behind all the miserable events that take place in this game are some lovable characters and fantastic gameplay that makes up for the game's flaws when it comes to a poorly paced story that isn't sure how to tell the story it wants to tell.  The first Last of Us game is primarily enjoyed due to the story of the game, but if you can let that go and really focus on the gameplay and individual characters instead of the story and actions they are taking and really bad ending, this game is a fun play through full of addictive gun play, somewhat challenging puzzles and lots of fun collectibles and crafting.  My only complaint as far as the gameplay itself goes is that it can sometimes be easy to get lost and unsure where to go.  Besides that, the guns all feel fun to shoot and the AI is really good and fun to go up against.  I don't think I'll be revisiting it anytime soon, but I am glad I played it."

Story telling is tight, action and gameplay is tighter, and you genuinely feel like the smart Survivor of an Apocalypse in this game. I do wish certain plot points were different, but this is Naughtdogs's story and I commend them for telling it the way they wanted to. This game is a great example of how to build a sequel off of an original classic whilst giving a story that is fresh and complete. It is rare to get a IP that doesn't make turning the property into a huge franchise the story's main priority. This game could be considered brutal and unforgiving, but, again, Naughtydog's should be commended for not pulling any punches, the completely right choice when telling a story about vengeance and how our own desperate need to satiate our anger can ruin our lives completely."

Santa01003,"Oct 24, 2023",9,"One of the games closest to excellence.
The narrative maintains very high levels and the plot choices are very original if you look at them from a videogame perspective. Naughty Dog never misses an opportunity to show the player a rawness and realism never seen before, also thanks to the stunning technical sector that adorns the whole adventure. The gameplay is enriched with contextual dodging and much less filled with repetitive actions such as placing beams and waiting for your partner to reach you, in short, everything is quicker and the linearity is perceived to a lesser extent. Shooting is equally improved and exploration is essential with regards to weapon ammunition and character skills, even if the latter are almost irrelevant in the game. Speaking about characters themselves, i would like to compliment both them for the interpretation and the developers for the facial animations. I think the only discordant note in the score is found in the rhythm of the story: in short, you live a certain period of time with a character, you reach a crucial moment and the events are suspended to make the you live the same period from a another point of view. I believe that this choice could lead many players to rush through this second part and not enjoy it, and I say this because I find it much more interesting than the first one"

NessieJN,"Oct 23, 2023",10,"The Last of us 2 wow wherever you look online it seems to be a very divisive game now obviously the user reviews are plagued with salty bots that give all PS games 0/10 but lets look past all the degenerates and talk about this incredible game.

TLOU2 is probably my favourite game I have ever played the only way to describe it is visceral and emotional Naughty dog took huge risks and it payed off, Visceral describes the combat and the world its attention to detail is incredible while shooting and hand to hand combat is gorgeously bloody. Emotional comes from the story don't worry no spoilers but naught dog took a big risk that I know many people didn't like but for me its what makes the game it sets a tone that the game executes so fantastically. Finally the best part of the game is the start and I genuinely think the first 2 hours or so for this game might be the best start to a game ever it takes you though every emotion in those first 2 hours that ends in a jaw dropping conclusion.

To conclude with the games technical state is a genuine marvel it looks this good on a ps4 never mind playing it on PS5 thro back compat at 60 fps in which I played on and platinumed, Incredibly polished the fluidity of animations attention to detail wow the devs went hard and this game just further more proves that you cant get experiences like this from any other place in gaming Naughty Dog and PlayStation sit upon the throne delivering truly memorable games."

Now talking about the game qualities, the game delivers one of the best performaces in acting in video game history, the characters face details are second to none, the horror present in this game is so much better than the first game, just like combat, and levels designs.
The last of us part 2 is one of the best story-driven, horror survivor games of all time. 10/10"
GrempisDumpster,"Oct 21, 2023",10,"The Last of Us Part 2 is an astounding sequel that manages to shine in the shadow of its predecessor. If I didn't have the masterful, graceful storytelling of Part 1 to compare it with, I'd score it as a 10/10. My one gripe is that the ending felt a little rushed, and that's it.

The only reason you should give this game a miss is if you find the existence of LGBTQ individuals scarier than cannibal fungus men. Those who throw tantrums over the""agenda"" of this game are delusional addicts of outrage, and suffer from a tragic poverty of imagination and curiosity. If that sounds like you - if the mere existence of people who look different and live differently to you makes you feel threatened or angry - I would suggest a less political game like Tetris, Minesweeper or Solitaire even.

Suprah,"Oct 18, 2023",8,"An 8/10 rating feels so wrong and so right at the same time. 
Incredible game with a phenomenal story that, at the same time, was just not executed well enough. Very ambitious and for the most part succeeds, just missing SOMETHING that ties everything together better. Also features some of my favorite combat and stealth in any game ever. While I disagree, I understand why some people give it a 10/10. Because when it hits, it HITS. But unfortunately it misses just a little too much for my liking.

I however absolutely cannot even comprehend how you give this a negative rating or 0/10. The graphics, combat, characters, performances are just way too damn good to believe a poorly executed narrative brings it down to a 4/10 or lower. 
Which makes sense since all the negative reviews I've seen are people crying about the game being woke and political, as if the first game was just sooooo staunchly conservative and featured 0 politics or divisive themes, instead of any actual criticisms on the game outside of the repetitive discourse about the game's plot. Which again, even if it was bad, cannot bring this marvel down THAT far."

Passando dalla trama fino ai piccoli dettagli è perfetto in ogni suo particolare, non c'è niente di fuori posto o messo lì tanto per.

Bet let’s be fair and not write the whole thing off, because the controversial part (for me) is bite-sized, and it will always be that. 

So despite everything that’s questionable in this game, the honest question remains: “WHY is this game so memorable and engages like no other?  What did Naughty Dog get right that makes this game an unforgettable human (not just gaming) experience that has our empathy gauges and emotions on overdrive throughout?”

The answer to that lies in being graceful about what you disagree with and shelving that, to let the compelling narrative and storytelling paint a nuanced experience that I have not seen attempted often (except for a handful of studios like Santa Monica) in the gaming world.  

It’s ambitious, bold and raw in its choices, that makes it an unexpected, close to realistic, ‘human’ experience. 

As a gamer with a huge appreciation for sophisticated but believable storytelling, while preserving excellent gaming mechanics that are in a league of its own, this game is a gift to the entire gaming community who care to see what Naughty Dog have tried to do here.  It’s genuinely unbelievable that they’ve pulled this off on so many different levels."

Its not atrocious obviously,, but the characters being more boring or out of character and all the cinveniences necesary fr the polt to advance resound too much when compared to tlou part 1, no new character its near the level of the ones at the first game but at the same time its not the flawless masterpiece a lot of journalists say it is.

Graphics - An example of just how much the PS4 is capable of. This is the best looking game on PS4 and really marks some new territory for the console and the industry. Every detail had it's own intention put on it. They wanted this to seem like a world that had been lived in and was being lived in. I think they did this perfectly! 2 Points. 

Sound/Music - Matching the first game, this one is no different. The bar was fully met here and I had no complaints. The emotion they expect you to feel was always perfectly conveyed. 2 Points. 

Level/Map Design - Once again, perfect! I can distinctly remember every area of this game. Every area is unique and something to be remembered. Some areas really provoke the use of stealth while others there is no choice but to fight your way out. There was plenty variety and every area could be enjoyed. 2 Points. 

Performance - This is at the top of the pyramid for Sony and Naughty Dog. They really nailed the performance of this game making sure everything felt fluid and there were no hiccups to be found. I didn't have one issue while playing this game. 2 Points. 

Enjoyment - Say what you will, there is no denying this was a story that you either loved or absolutely hated. I sit on the end of feeling like I was able to comprehend just what Naughty Dog wanted me to get out of this. The game is heartfelt, emotional, gruesome and invigorating. The game-play really stepped up from the first title. I felt like this game was just as fun to play as it was to watch. This allowed for an experience I will not forget. 2 Points."

Cdubz,"Sep 27, 2023",10,"No spoilers. I had incredibly mixed feelings about this game on my first playthrough, but after watching hours of video essays and playing through it multiple times, I have been able to form a revised opinion. I absolutely love and adore this game. Yes it has some pacing issues, but the pros heavily outweigh the cons. The gameplay is exciting, engaging, and brutal with great replay value (in my opinion). Some of the best stealth gameplay. The characters are likable and you really form an attachment to them by the end of the game. The game is about 20 hours(ish) long but it doesn't feel like it. I was engaged the entire time. Even on my first playthrough when I wasn't enjoying it to the fullest, I was still **** in by the emotions of the characters. If you have played the first game, I highly recommend the sequel. The story is even more emotional and raw. I wouldn't recommend playing Part 2 before Part 1. You NEED the background info to fully immerse yourself in the story. If you have read this far, thank you for your interest in my rambling. Long story short, get the game if you want emotional damage. It's not for the faint of heart."

Prince-Kaven,"Sep 26, 2023",8,"Oh dear where do we start with The Last of Us Part II. Very mixed opinions from the Community however, the gameplay and the story particularly with character development was done masterfully. Playing as Ellie, A 22 Year Old Woman Born In the mixed of the global Pandemic Induced by the Plantae Plague, Her mother Is deseased and Father Unknown, in The previous installment She forms a Father/Daughter Like Relationship With One Joel Miller, a character who fans of the franchise have come to love and cherish who gets Brutally murdered in cold blood in front of her eyes by Abby Anderson Of the Fireflies. Shortly thereafter she embarks on what looks to be a revenge mission, Hunting Abby Through the Beautifully Designed Desolate City Of Seattle Washington. While On this Journey Players Will Have to Take every scenario with a strategic Thought out Aproach, Limited Resources and Neccesity to Craft Usefull Items Will have players Planning their Every Move as they encounter all new enemies which will require them To Play Differently than before. Players got hit with an unexpected big twist as they were suddenly playing as the supposed Antagonist which may have been a tough pill to swallow and arguably the most controversial decision in all of gaming, but as players discovered this is all in light of showing that perhaps Abby is not such an evil character. It was certainly a unique and incredibly bold approach that sent players through the portal to the other side of the cutlery seeing all the events they had just witnessed play out once again but this time from Abbys Point of View. Players may notice that unironically Ellie actually carries out more actions associated with the word ""Evil"" than abby does but this does not mean Ellie Is evil Either. Both Ellie and Abby are in fact neutral. As we discover more about Abbys Past and The Events That Brought her to executing Joel Miller we realise that Abby and Ellies Paths and Goals are not so different. A truth that Ellie realises at the end. Players were met with disappointment through lack of control and decision over the ending as the entire community was split as to what they would've chosen to do if given the aforementioned choice. Overall the game has enjoyable gameplay, stunning visuals and a story that will send it's players through a tornado of emotions with deeply routed characters and intense relationships between them carrying with itself a very clear and present motto that violence only creates more violence. one of the most innovative takes on the common revenge story."

The gameplay is about as good as the first game. The story has obviously been very controversial. While I wish it had been different, I can't say it's a bad story. It made me feel more than just about any other game I've played. I've said many times that this game is pretty much the most depressing game I've ever played. After several playthroughs and months of hindsight, I really appreciate this game. Yes, it's no Last of Us (original) but it is a great game."

caoheebh,"Sep 23, 2023",1,"Abby: A boring and uncharismatic characterAbby is the game's main antagonist. She is a former member of the Fireflies, an organization seeking a cure for the brain infection that caused the apocalypse. Abby is a strong and skilled woman, but she is also a violent and cruel **** game spends half the time with Abby, which is a problem for many players. Abby is a boring and uncharismatic character. She's not interesting or relatable, and her revenge story is simplistic and predictable.A forced storyThe game tries to force players to empathize with Abby. The game shows Abby's story in a way that makes it more relatable, but that's not enough to make players like her.Abyss is a horrible character. She kills Joel, a character loved by the public, in a brutal and unnecessary way. It's hard for players to forget this, even if Abby had her own reasons for doing what she did.ConclusionThe Last of Us Part II is a technically impressive game, but its story is disappointing. The story tries to force players to empathize with an undesirable character, and it doesn't **** game is a good example of how a poorly executed story can ruin a gaming experience. If you're looking for a gripping, gripping story, The Last of Us Part II isn't the game for you."

What did those monkey fans except from the second installment?
A wholesome fun time for Joel and Ellie?
""Oh no, they killed Joel, the main character""
Is Joel the main character just because you played most of the game with him in the first game?
Or maybe it was Ellie all along the way? I'd go as far as to say that Cordyceps is the protagonist of this story, but the most important part is that those monkey fans wanted this game to be just like any other game where you play with the main character - talk about inovation.
Playing with Abby gave you an insight into her reasons for torturing Joel?

alijandro316,"Sep 9, 2023",0,"The Last of Us Part II: A Melancholic Muddle - 0/10

The realm of narrative-driven video games is replete with tales of grandeur, and ""The Last of Us"" stood as a shining example of such magnificence. Thus, it's with a heavy heart that one must navigate the murky waters of its sequel, ""The Last of Us Part II.""

From the outset, the game's tone feels disjointed. Where the original painted a poignant picture of humanity's struggle and the lengths one might go to protect loved ones, Part II meanders, oscillating between half-realized themes and tonal inconsistencies. The gravity of Ellie's journey, so deeply personal in its intent, is often lost amidst the cacophony of secondary narratives that add little to the overarching tale.

Visually, while the world of ""The Last of Us Part II"" boasts intricate details, there's a palpable absence of soul. Environments, though technically marvelous, lack the atmospheric tension that once made every corner turned a potential threat. This sterility permeates even the character models, rendering emotional sequences somewhat hollow.

The game's narrative decisions remain its most contentious aspect. Characters, once beloved, are offered up on the altar of shock value, their arcs concluding in ways that feel unearned and, at times, gratuitous. This penchant for subversion, rather than adding layers, often detracts from the emotional heft of the storyline.

Gameplay, a potential saving grace, also falters. Combat scenarios, though more varied, often descend into repetition, lacking the strategic depth of the original. Stealth, a staple of the series, feels more forced than ever, with AI patterns that seem predictable rather than intuitive.

In sum, ""The Last of Us Part II"" stands as a shadow of its predecessor. Despite its technical prowess and moments of genuine emotional depth, the game feels like a disjointed tapestry of missed opportunities. One can't help but yearn for the nuanced storytelling and immersive world-building of the original."

Rest of the cast was fantastic and that ending was a bit sad but set up the potential LoU3. I absolutely will watch Last of Us Season 2+3 when they come to rehash this game.

KillianZane,"Sep 7, 2023",0,"The Last of Us Part 2, unfortunately, deserves its 0/10 rating due to its deeply disappointing story that left many fans feeling betrayed.

The facial expressions and emotions give a sense of realism you've most likely never seen before. This game is an amazing mixture between violence and peace, revenge and forgiveness, survival and self destruction. Not to mention the level of details it has, which is top notch.

ForRealGamers,"Sep 1, 2023",2,"Still don’t understand why they didn’t make this game about Abby and her back story ? It would have eased her character on us and made us actually care for her more and the moments to come instead of her just coming out of no where and BOOM Joel dead …and then continue to force her down our throats and try to make us feel for her after doing that to?? Like yeah Joel is an **** but he is a **** that been through playing the story for and we understand why he is the way he is ??

KamenRiderDark,"Aug 27, 2023",0,"The gameplay and environment are good, but overall tainted by the terrible narrative and overall theme of the game. Naughty Dog tries to warn and discourage players about the consequences of pursuing revenge, yet they force us to play as a character right after said character kills one of our beloved protagonist from the series! How exactly does this discourage us from seeking revenge when it only makes us sympathetic to their horrible actions.

Both Abby and Ellie do not mature or get character development and they essentially remain the same towards end of the game. Player's spend hours seeing their character get revenge by killing key characters and innocent NPC's only to spare the main target at the very last second? It felt like we wasted our time and we were left with dread and disappointment. It doesn't make sense for the main character to just walk away from their objective at the last second despite the fact said character gave up the pursuit sometime earlier in the story.

There are some characters in the game that do not supplement character development or show qualities that make us feel sympathetic towards them. Take for instance Jesse and Manny who are only there to provide some drama to the narrative without providing memorable personal traits.

The flashbacks were also poorly executed. Those flashbacks should have been the first playable parts of the game and then switch over to the main plot. It would have made the game's ending even more impressionable instead of making us feel like all our efforts were basically for nothing. I honestly think Naughty Dog should have created two campaign modes for the game, one focused completely from Ellie's perspective and another on Abby's story. Upon completion of Ellie's story we will have the option to complete Abby's campaign instead of having us switch between these characters.

Overall, I don't think this game is worth $59+ and I am disappointed with it. I think Naughty Dog should remake this game or at least learn their mistakes by the time they release Last of Us III."

Madremia,"Aug 24, 2023",0,"The graphics are great, but not the gameplay. There are some issues with the gameplay mechanics and AI. And part of it has to do with the story telling and how the developers are trying to sway your opinion. To avoid spoilers, I’ll have to be cryptic here. You play as more than one character, and there is a significant difference between how easy they are to control (which seems to be another lame attempt to make you like that character more). Trying to play with Ellie makes it seem like she is physically ****. It’s like they turn the difficulty down a couple notches with the other character. They move faster, aim better, have better weapons that do more damage, get more supplies, are not noticed as easily, and craft more supplies with less materials. It’s a whole different game where you don’t care who you’re fighting or how much ammo you have, you’re going to win.
Playing the guitar was a clever way of using the PS4 controller, but after doing it again and again, it’s becomes a distraction. Can we get back to the **** yea, that’s not the strong-point on this one, is it?
Concerning the **** seemed the developers could not figure out whether they wanted a stealth or combat game. The AI follows predetermined patrol paths in every scene, until you do something. Then they obviously gravitate towards you no matter where you are hiding. Say you set a trap and sneak away to a quiet corner. Once the trap is triggered, all remaining enemies start moving towards you. Humans and infected both do this. It became most obvious when a human discovered me while I was hiding behind cover, and they were on top of the building I was in. Then he starting shooting and doing damage...through the roof. Hmm, ok.
If humans and infected are in the same scene, they will only engage in a brief confrontation before they act like the other side is invisible. That part made me curse out loud. You try to lure infected towards human opponents, they engage and then...just stop and wander around each other looking for you.

Story: Disappointing, over and over. The drama about ‘who kissed who?!’ makes it seem like you’re watching Pretty Little Liars. I wouldn’t actually know because I’ve never watched that show. Because I don’t care about who is kissing who.
Overall, this starts as a revenge story and it’s obvious they want to say that revenge is futile. But lord they make you pay for it, and that message got beat to a pulp with the ancient Greeks. You find yourself saying, ‘wait we’re going off to do what? What does that have to do with this story? Is this even the same story, and who heck is that guy?’ After a while, it’s not the same story at all

Concerning the events that happen, the developers try too hard for shock value and to mess with your head in obvious and tacky ways. You’re forced to do things that should have been a choice, and were probably bad ideas to begin with.
Also on that part, the decisions that are made by the characters seem unbelievably immature considering the world where the game takes place, and they’re own statements. The characters make it obvious how they little they care about other characters but then drop everything to go do the impossible for them.
Essentially, the first and second game have almost nothing to do with each other plot-wise. Watching it was painful and I wish I had not seen it.

Skip it. For me, the story of Last of Us ended with Joel and Ellie walking into Jackson after they left the hospital. He lies, she cries, and the guitar plays on. Best happy ending I’ve seen in a long time"

This story intentionally makes you feel depression, anger, hate, empathy, sadness, love and the list goes on.  It's a tough story that gives boxes in the soul to its player.  If you are looking for the usual story with a happy ending this game is not for you.  But please don't listen to the haters.  Anyone who hates him is emotionally immature and only acts out of emotional anger and follows the herd.  that the game came out and before it came out it was a trend to hate it.  People hated him just from the leaks and thought this whole game was **** because that's what the leaker told them.  which is not true.  Then YouTubers saw it was a trend to hate him so they made hate videos before he even came out.  Got a lot of views.  And made more people who didn't play it hate it.

decoamelo,"Aug 17, 2023",10,"This game is what separates a mere game from a work of art. Simply a masterpiece. It improves the already great The Last of Us I in every way possible. The story is deeper and more mature, the game play is absolutely perfect, the level design is great, the acting is the best I've seen so far, and the graphics just don't make sense in a PS4 game.
I have beaten this game 3 times already, and will definitely play it again in the future. Which is really rare for me, when it comes to story-driven games.
The fact that TLOU2 has a 5.8 grade in metacritic as I write this review is something I cannot comprehend. It only shows how part of the game community is simply not ready for a game like this. 10 out of 10 without a doubt"

As a huge fan of the first game (especially for its story), I can't help but feel a little disappointed for part two's lackluster (in comparison) writing. Lots of missed potential given what a technical masterpiece this game is."

This game's characters, their relationships, and their struggles are portrayed better than in 99% of Hollywood movies. When I am playing this game, every line of dialogue the characters say and every facial expression they make feels like it has been put there for a reason, with great care.

Ben_2007,"Aug 7, 2023",10,"I never leave reviews for games, but the reception that 'The Last of Us Part II' has received gives me much incentive to share my opinion. This game, to me, is a masterpiece; and that is the case for many people. However, it seems that just as many people view this profoundly impacting game as nothing more than a disappointment.

It is my opinion that many of the criticisms these people pummel at this game actually have very little thought behind them. Now, you are allowed to like and dislike what you please - there is no problem with that - but the lack of understanding (present within the majority of negative reviews) of things as simple as what this game is about, suggests to me that many people have not bothered to think about this game with an open critical mind; they have simply seen their favourite creators criticise it, and have actively looked for reasons as they play to have the same opinion. In fact, this lack of understanding is so dumbfounding, that I would not be surprised if some of these scathing reviewers have not even played the game.

Many criticise the game for being a 'bland' story about how 'revenge is bad'. These people have missed the point. Revenge is a secondary theme in this game; the narrative is largely about obsession, regret, and perspective. It is a complex story, and all of these themes work together to create an intricate commentary on the nature of humankind; Naughty Dog presents how easy it is for humans to grow too attached to the people and beliefs that they care about, and how they begin to base their very actions and morals about their perceived importance of such people and beliefs; one person's loved one could be another person's worst enemy, and - when they attempt to accept and understand this fact - they can start to lose their mind. The game's central characters each play a part in presenting this idea to the player; think of how many people Joel murdered in the first game. Whilst Ellie views him as someone special, it makes a lot of sense that others would loathe him for what he did.

But this is not all that Druckmann and his team do to convey this message - they do more. They do, perhaps, the most daring thing they could possibly have done.

They drag us into the fray.

Characters - that we once loved and thought were heroes - become the enemy, as we are forced to play as someone that hates them to their very core. This allows us to relate the game's message to ourselves; perhaps the people WE love are hated by others? It is a chilling thought that attempts to induce empathy in us; it's a thought that is masterfully taken from Naughty Dog's post apocalyptic USA and driven right home to the player, who is given the same task that the game's central characters must overcome; accepting and understanding their worst enemy.

These are the ideas that Naughty Dog explores - not the idea that 'revenge is bad'. Yes, revenge is presented as being bad; but that is not what the game is about. Similarly, in the first game, the infected are presented as 'bad', in that they kill you if they drain your health; however, this is not the game's central theme - the true central theme has nothing to do with the infected, as it is about the love between Ellie and Joel. It sounds like a silly comparison, but it is - indeed - very silly to truly believe that this game's message can be summed up as 'revenge is bad'.

The Last of Us Part II is a must play. I have not touched on the gameplay, graphics design, music, or anything other than the story. Pretty much everybody believes that these other things are brilliantly executed, myself included. I simply wanted to talk about the game's narrative, as this is what most of the discourse regards.

However, what I will touch on - before I conclude - is how representative this game is of many different communities and cultures. It is very inclusive, in ways that made me smile - for example, there is a trans character who appears two-thirds of the way through the game, and becomes integral to the plot. I have never before played a game that is at all representative of the trans community. It's truly amazing. We have finally been given a glimmer of hope for the future in terms of how people are represented in the media.

(Sidenote: I have a hunch that bigotry may play a part in why this game is so hated. Of course, I can never truly know what goes on in other people's minds; but, considering that games like Assassin's Creed II - which is about a white sexist man, and DOES present a bland revenge narrative - are considered to be really good, it begins to present itself as a possibility.)

I truly think that, if you have not played this game, you should give it a shot. There are many twists and turns, and - from the opening shot of Joel scrubbing his guitar, to the closing credits - there were many moments that brought genuine tears to my eyes.

This is one of the best games ever made.

Have a nice day! x"

Body a nápady. Vyprávění příběhu z pohledu dvou postav. Udělat to v rámci třech dnů. Vidět různé události z jiných směrů. Vidět sebezničující cestu za pomstou a druhou stranu mince. Bojovat proti vlastní postavě. Tohle všechno byly fajn nápady. Bohužel to ale autoři pospojovali tak krkolomně a křečovitě, že prostě to působilo strašně. Už je to dlouho co mě iritovalo chování postav v nějaké hře a nikdy bych to nečekal zrovna tady.

I know some people didn’t like the story because they think it is forced, and, in fact, it can be a little bit, but I don’t think the game deserves a low rating just because of this, since the story stills very good. The gameplay is great, so it is the soundtrack and the character development: when you kill a NPC, you’re killing someone that has a name and friends, and it is shown when you play with that another character (that I’ll hide the name because it can be a spoiler for some people that didn’t see nothing about the game yet), but I think the best part of the game is the feeling it gives you in some moments.

The game should be a 10, but I chose to rate it as a 9 because of the final part, where we face a different group, but the game doesn’t tell anything about them, and it (the final part) lasts less than it should. But, after that, the cutscenes are masterpieces, making you rethink about all Ellie’s choises."

Gameplay - It's a greatly expanded version of what we saw in the first game. Animations are a lot smoother, enemy and companion AI is much better, the damage you can do together with the sound design make for a really grueling yet amazing experience.

Graphics - Definitely amongst the best we will ever see this generation, it's crazy how they were able to make such a beautiful and detailed game run so well in a console that came out 7 years ago.

Atmosphere/World building - Each and every area is full of details, full of ""life"" and have interesting documents that tell small stories that are always interconnected with the main plot, be it to give you some extra context or small stories of what happened in that specific area  which sometimes go hand in hand with the puzzles & safes.

Sound Design/Soundtrack - It's just perfect. The work done on everything sound related in this game, be it from Gustavo Santaolalla or the amazing sound engineers/devs is astonishingly amazing.

Story - Divisive? Maybe. Good? Definitely, one of the best stories I've seen in gaming personally. It has a few pacing issues but I didn't find it nearly as bad as people were making it out to be. People talk about ""agendas"" and whatnot, but it's clear it's filled with passion and it's exactly what the devs set out to do (not the suits). I find it brave that even with all of that drivel, they decided to do what they wanted to do with its story!"

The writing is not that great, usually that's what get praised about this game.  It is the generic moder trope of deconstructionist relativism, in interactive movie form.
The mechanics are ok.. but to get to that you have to use unlikable characters in game.  Not a 10, a solid 6, but giving it a 0 to balance the undeserved 10s."

The last of us part 2 doesn`t promise the great plot but during the game I started understanding that this sight of revenge is special. All the details, all the violence, all the realationships between the heroes show us the real revenge and all the consequences. I haven`t seen anything like that before! This game makes me feel different. Using soundtracks, using the space around the game makes me feel like the heroes feel. And there are not many such games today. This game is ALIVE! I feel pity for those who didn`t understand all of that and felt disappointed like it was with rdr2. I hope that in the future everyone wil see the potential of The last of us part 2."

- Gameplay is fun
- Environments are beautiful and highly detailed

- The quality of the story is questionable and noticeably went downhill in the second half of the game.
- Parts of the story also felt preachy in a way the first game didn't, which broke immersion for me somewhat.
- Certain sections really amplified the suffering to a level I would consider to be torture porn, which I found unpleasant rather than compelling.
- The ending was not satisfying."

Nevbear1206,"Jul 22, 2023",9,"This game will forever remain in the shadow of its infinitely better predecessor. However, this is still an amazing title from Naughty Dog, and a true technical showcase for not only the PS4 but for gaming as a whole. The breathtaking visuals stand tall amongst many ""next gen"" entries, and the layer of polish that comes from a 6-year long development process is much appreciated and apparent. Exploration is improved upon with huge, sweeping areas that contain all kinds of collectibles and resources to gather for your next combat encounter. Combat itself feels phenomenal, with immense layers of depth and freedom for any specific playstyle. The soundtrack is once again perfectly atmospheric and fitting, serving as an extension of the music found in the first game. Where this game fails to be a true masterpiece is in its narrative. This is a disheartening, disgusting, and unnecessary story that should have never been told. The Last of Us stood on its own two feet as a perfect gem, not needing a sequel or any more content. Each character from the first title has been stripped of their soul and humanity, leaving this game feeling hollow and empty by the end rather than climactic and beautiful. While I am disappointed by the choices made by the producers and developers, I would be a liar if I said that this was truly a horrible game that was lacking in any other aspect. The Last of Us goes out with a whimper after an amazing ride. I hope Part III never comes."

NeverCasual,"Jul 19, 2023",7,"Unfortunately the game has become heavily review-bombed (on both ends), diminishing the value of user scores significantly. In my opinion this is a shame as user scores used to be something I always payed attention to when buying games.

The story of the game is very good. The creative direction it took is absolutely justified considering the ending of ""Last of Us I"", where the protagonist effectively becomes the antagonist of the story pretty much wiping out an entire faction/hospital dedicated to helping humanity fight the virus. Creating a sequel around the consequences of Joel's actions there is a really good starting point. Playing characters from both sides adds depth to the story and you'll start questioning the actions of your previously favourite characters soon enough - without either side acting out of character.

The gameplay does not differ much from ""Last of Us Part I"". Stealth is still massively rewarded on high difficulties as you can get heavily punished for little mistakes in open combat. Lower difficulties do not punish you for brute forcing your way through the encounters as much. Open areas are almost always accompanied by dialog making them less monotonous while exploring or searching for collectibles.
The upgrade system has not changed much

My biggest problem with the game is the actual length of the game and replay value. You can finish the game within 15 hours and since it is heavily carried by the story and character development a second playtrough (needed for platinum) felt really boring. It probably gets replay value after putting it away for a year tho'."

I have to say, I don't understand how so many goes against this piece of art. How those critics convinced me for a long time to not play the game, how those critics made me critic the game too. Absurd. The game is in my opinion, better than the first one.

Johnson, Troy Baker and Laura Bailey (despite thinking that the character of Abby is very unlikable for me, Laura Bailey’s performance is very good), so yes i do think the sequel is worth experiencing it

Korakas,"Jul 9, 2023",10,"Ok so I played the first game and right after that the second one. I gotta say the series is a masterpiece in every aspect. I don't plan on **** here, whatever I say will be an objectively opinion. The game is surely for those who can withstand dark and bloody scenes. The plot may have some minor holes, but trust me you won't even understand them while playing. It's a shame 68k people (at the time this rating is being written) are rating the game with 5 and less. Why they do so? Because there is a scene with people of the same gender kissing etc, etc. These people didn't even begin to think that the people that used to live in a post-apocalyptic world wouldn't care less if the person they love and want is from the same gender or if others will care about it. And that's beautiful and real. They want to feel even a little bit better in any way, even if that means something like that I just mentioned or doing dr*gs etc. The game has a plot that makes you think like you are a character inside the game and it shows you the point of view of every single one of them. At some point in the game when I got bit by a clicker and died by mine own mistake I, myself flinched like I had felt the bite, I understood that I had reached the point that I felt like I was in the game. It doesn't leave any question marks about how did this or that happen. It explains and shows you everything. The graphics are stunning especially if you play the game in a good monitor or TV. The physics left me speechless, either if it had to do with combat or with the nature or with any little - insignificant for other games - detail. I was left with my jaw down many times from the details or the story too. Of course deaths happen like in the 1st game of The Last Of Us. And people have no right rating the game with 5 and lower grades because they didn't want a death of a whatever-charachter to happen. That disgusts me. If anyone that has played the 1st game but not the 2nd reads this, please go and play it. It can alter your whole brain chemistry in a beautiful and amazing way. It can mature you. It didn't happen with me, because this special place in my heart belongs to a completely different show. Back to the game, I can understand why so many people loved it, because I do now too, but I don't plan on making anyone play it by force or spam them about it. Their loss. It's a game that you have to be mature to understand, accept and comprehend whatever message it's passing onto you. I hope my review was helpful and... ""When you are lost in the darkness, look for the light."""
CapitanQwark,"Jul 9, 2023",10,"Amazing game. It is better than the first part on every aspect. All I can say that the story absorbs you and never lets you focused on other things. It knows what it's doing to keep you watching the screen. There are a lot of users crying about the inclusion, but don't worry. If you aren't into that kind of things, remember that the inclusion of characters with other gender indentities is not something that DRIVES the plot of the game. It's only an aspect treated on some parts of the game. I highly recommend you to play this game. is something between The Last of Us Part 1 and Uncharted 4."

Cvmbackbehere78,"Jul 4, 2023",10,One of the greatest video games I’ve ever played. The hate this game gets is honestly astonishing and most of the reasons it gets hate is because people can’t accept that **** people are now in media.

TobeyMacGyver,"Jul 2, 2023",1,"One of the worst sequels ever made in my opinion, a bad and dumb story that doesn't make any sense, they kill Joel way too soon and make him and Tommy two idiots that trust in strangers that they never saw, I stopped playing after we take control of Abby and only plan on finishing it if I can get it free, I won't waste a single penny on this garbage."
CPR,"Jul 2, 2023",0,"The pacing is so bad that I don't want to play the Abby line at all.
The emotion curve is broken and the gameplay is boring after a few levels.
All the plots are mashed together in a way that the player's immersion is not concerned seriously.
Graphics is good, music is good, runtime performance is good.
But only worth 5/10 or even worse.
Or sorry, I am an Asian, 4/10, -1 for the racist joke.

SamaelsBook,"Jun 29, 2023",9,"The Last of Us 2 - ШЕДЕВР, это был тот самый первый случай, когда я был полность согласен с мнением критиков, и в недоумении от хейта. Точнее нет, я понимаю из-за чего хейт, но не понимаю другого - игра 18+, стало быть незрелых детей быть не должно (смешно, но хотелось бы). Половина типов которые поставили ниже 6 на Metacritic скорее всего пришли с ютуба, и просто накинули ей 1, ну я так думаю. А те, кто прошли и поставили низкую оценку, у меня вопрос. Вы поставили низкую оценку какому проекту? Ролевой игре с правом выбора и разными концовками, или линейному сюжету уже написанному за вас? Вы когда играете в эту игру, в 1 очередь вы должны понимать, что вы зритель, а не пользователь, это уже отснятое кино/написанная книга, как угодно, а вы ставите оценку потому что игра идёт не так, как вы этого хотели, с**а 18+ игра в сеттинге зомби апокалипсиса видите ли показывает смерти, и использует центровых персонажей - как ЛЮДЕЙ, а не бессмертных героев, как людей которые могут чувствовать, ошибаться и внезапно умереть, да умереть без героического подвига, без какого-то будущего смысла, а просто умереть, потому что игра про жизнь, а не идеалы. Да мне тоже было больно в начале, да неприятно в середине, но я понимаю это, как будто я читаю книгу, упрямую, идиотскую, но безумно захватывающую и великолепно написанную книгу. Мой вердикт 10/10, хотелось бы забыть, что бы ещё раз пройти."

The graphics, setting, voice acting and soundtrack are all phenomenal and among the best gaming has seen. Unfortunately this is a narrative driven game and the narrative didnt click with me at all.

The characters also didn't really do it for me. Most side characters were very bland and forgettable.

Fbbolat,"Jun 27, 2023",2,"After 2-3 years I have played the game first time without any argument in my mind as a lover of the first game .The last of us part 2 is a game with incredible mechanics and graphics Naughty dog engineers made an incredible job on that noone can argue about that it's a masterpiece but if we come to the main point this game was Joel and Ellie's story as the producer said so I was expecting a game that continues the story of ellie and Joel but it was an absolute disappointment for me I have played like 25-30 hours to experience everything and half of that was with Abby! Neil druckman if you want us to get revenge let us get our revenge there is a mindset that chracters have in the first game but 2nd game is not loyal to that as we know Joel and Tommy are real badass survivours from the first game but they get ambushed like idiots I dont even want to talk about SJWs it's another point that I dont want to write here The game starts with Joel's death from the abbys group and want to get revenge for Joel we kill everyone and when wwe face abby game goes on abby sight before 4 years is that a joke you are making everything to make abby a  Main enemy then you are making her a Protaganist that I hate play with Than we beat ellie with abby :!!! that's realy disgusting after all that time when ellie come all way to get revenge she decides to forgive so I wanna ask what was all that for why did you lost all of that great potential of that game and betrayed the story of Ellie and Joel

The best chracter that I really liked in the game was Tommy I wish we take the revenge of Joel with his little brother Tommy the scene which he killed manny with sniper was really amazing he reminded a miller's power and badass moments the amazing moments in the game was absolutely Tommy scenes hunting abby and Manny + Joel and Ellie's moments.. İt was a game I like but the storyline realy upset me so My score is 2 and it's for the Engineers (Even you make protaganist The TOMMY and we take the revenge of Joel's that will be a game but you have really screwed up the story that's what I can say if we get killed by the people's son's or daugter's we will be the most wanted person in the whole the last of us universe with thousands kills really really so upset and sad):(.("
drseven,"Jun 27, 2023",10,"It has been one of the games that I have enjoyed the most. Few games make you feel so many emotions, many times contradictory. Playable is sublime, fun and responds perfectly. I'm glad they dared to make such a tough story with such an emotional charge.

As a negative aspect, in the last bars of the game it feels too long, and it can come to feel repetitive at a playable level, due to its long duration."
OnSurfari,"Jun 26, 2023",10,"If you're thinking about playing this game, justifying whether or not to invest you time and money into a game that has SO MANY negative reviews...I present an honest review based on my experience playing the game from opening to closing credits...

This game is a Masterpiece! Pure and simple.

I debated about playing the Last of Us Part II mostly based on my experience with the first game. I never finished the first game, I got frustrated and moved onto other games. Looking back, I was not in the right state of mind for a slow and steady walk through a story.

I was on the fence about TLOU2. Initially due to the negative reviews, but then I stumbled across some 'grounded' playthrough and it peaked my interest.

If you are on the fence as I was, this story was amazing. It's not a ""bad guy does something so you need to get revenge"" story. It's so much deeper, so many layers. Without spoiling it, I was torn half way through the story, it forces you to consider your decisions and the rippling effect. This game left me looking forward to the 3rd chapter in the series if we are lucky to get one.

I just finished the game earlier today, felt I needed to leave a review because I initially read the negative reviews here and needed to shed some light for those considering playing this game."

VoxLuden,"Jun 26, 2023",5,"In trading consistency for shock value, the diverted expectations that this game creates largely divided the space of reviews. It has some impressive technological advancements in terms of graphics, however the story just wasn't for me as much, and that wasn't because of the controversial cast or their actions. Instead it was the rebranding of the actions taken in The Last of Us 1 and, subsequently, the two stories that had to be told to frame the conclusion of the sequel, neither receiving the sole attention they deserved.

It's an ok, linear survival shooter, but it won't ever earn the love that the first of it's series did."

Music by Gustavo Santaolalla it's just perfect. The post apocayptic world was perfectly made. Cons: the game was too long and some parts were not essential to the story but overall i enjoyed it from start to finish. The gameplay is fun and better than TLoU but repetitive sometimes. I felt so much emotions,  while playing it, I felt empathy in every character even if they were completely different! This game is an experience that everyone should do.

Keakae,"Jun 25, 2023",2,"It's a great game on some aspects, but when the story does not make sense, when there's so many easy to read manipulative narrative techniques to enforce you to feel things, non-sens events happening to help the plot continuing to live, it's just non-immersive, non interesting. All the story is understood after 2h in the game and when you dive a little into characters perspective, history and minds, you'll figure out they are no longer who they used to be, making senseless choices that are way off from what they used to be from the first game. They even modificate things in TLOU 1 remake for the plot to have more sense in this useless sequel. Even using the word ""sequel"" is not right, it's more like a bad spin-off, they even used fake commercials to trick the player into buying this game. I regret spending my money, and my time on this ego-trip from the writter, who believe he's the only one creator of TLOU franchise. And we are lucky he's not, because TLOU 1 is a great piece of art. This is just a constant disapointment, easy and lazy storytelling, bad characters development, bad pacing, bad sequences, I mean, how can a flashback into a flashback can be consider a great ""storytelling"" ?

Great respect to the devs though, that made great graphics, that might be the best on PS4 that I've played. Gameplay got no real new interesting features, just melee combat feels better.
I feel a little diaspointed with the OST as I expected more from Gustavo Santaolalla, who made a better OST in the first one. Thanks to him, the first opus had a real identity, here it feels just okay. Nothing to be rememered.
At the end, everything in this game feels so enforced that it becomes funny."

lukeak,"Jun 24, 2023",0,"I loved Last of Us 1, but Last of Us 2 was very interesting to play and not in a positive way. I was seriously enjoying the story about Joel's death and Ellie trying to avenge his death, and Ellie's romance on the side. It could have been one of the best games ever.
Unfortunately, towards the end, I was forced to play as Abby. I really liked Joel as a character, and when Abby killed him, I, of course, developed a serious dislike for Abby. Furthermore, Abby is just a pissed-off, unlikable character in general. Thus, I really didn't want to play as Abby and found myself just letting zombies kill me because I wanted to return to playing as Ellie, and it was more enjoyable to watch her die than to try to help her survive.
I tried to play it out as Abby, hoping it would return to Ellie at any moment, but hours went by, and it still made me play as Abby until eventually I just said, ""Screw it. I'm not enjoying this game at all, and I stopped playing altogether. I've played almost every rpg there is, and there is only one other game I have stopped playing halfway through. Thus, Last of Us 2 is one of the only games I rate as a 0 out of 10 since it was so unenjoyable that I didn't even finish it. The lesson here is NEVER FORCE THE PLAYER TO PLAY AS AN UNLIKABLE ANTAGONSIST, PLEASE.
After, being so disappointed with Part 2, I don't recommend either of these games."

Imagine waiting 7 years for the continuation of one of the best written games of the last generation, just to obtain a sequel that not just is a mess in it's writing, but completely misses the point of the last game; it's not just supposed good and evil but an spectrum between, but TLOU2 just tries to make every character being one or another at certain points just because the writer and/or director says so.

The attention to detail in every scene is breathtaking, with stunning environments that immerse players in a post-apocalyptic world. The sound design is equally impressive, with haunting melodies and ambient noises that amplify the sense of tension and dread.  The gameplay mechanics have been refined and improved, making for a more fluid and intuitive experience. Stealth and combat encounters are challenging and require careful strategy, adding depth to the gameplay."

J_R,"Jun 12, 2023",7,"7.4/10

The discourse around The Last of Us Part 2 went really well didn’t it. On one side we have the mainstream critics with their heads so far up their own arse they are unable to properly critically engage with a game like this and ended up just giving it 10s. Then on the other side we have a large chunk of the gaming community being a bunch of immature children unable to deal with a piece of media/art. The truth is The Last of Us Part 2 is a well made and ambitious game. But unfortunately the developers may have bit off more than they could chew and the game is a bit of a mess that didn’t land right.

The most important thing to say about The Last of Us Part 2 is I am so glad they tried and that they were allowed to try. Most games in the AAA space are so safe. The fact that nobody stepped in at any point to say just give us a safe, predictable sequel and that Naughty Dog was permitted to do their thing is excellent. Naughty Dog could have just given us a basic journey across the country with Joel and Ellie on some simple revenge quest but instead they aimed higher and tried to deliver a grand, ambitious game about hate. I really hope the backlash to this game doesn’t cause future AAA games to be even more risk averse because that would be sad to see as AAA games are already, typically too frightened of interesting characters/stories, challenging and/or new gameplay, real puzzles, bold style, old genres, etc.

The most obvious thing is this game looks phenomenal. This is as good as it gets on PS4. The attention to detail is staggering. The number of unique objects and animations in this game is ridiculous. I cannot stress enough how impressive it is. I don’t think anyone else is even close to being on the same level as Naughty Dog. All aspects of the presentation including visuals, attention to detail, atmosphere, sound, acting performances, how well it runs, etc, is all top notch and if this was the only thing games were rated on then maybe a 10/10 wouldn’t be so silly.

The gameplay is exactly what you expect if you have played the first game. It is solid and enjoyable but not exceptional. They make a number of sensible improvements over the first game, like going prone to hide under things and to crawl through grass. I really enjoyed that the areas are larger and more vertical which allowed combat encounters to be more dynamic and free. Resources are just limited enough to keep you changing up your weapon and approach. The combat is very violent and visceral and the AI reacts pretty well to what you are doing both verbally and mechanically. I had a good time jumping out of stealth causing some horrific carnage and then diving back into stealth. The environmental puzzles felt more varied this time too. However the game regularly wasted my time and the gameplay just isn’t enough to keep me coming back for multiple playthroughs. It also feels like a missed opportunity. They could have done more with the gameplay especially with two playable characters.

Now for the games biggest issues; story, characters and pacing. First of all this game is a bloater, god damn why is it so long? An editor needed to come along a just cut so much fat off this game. The pacing is a complete mess and most of the time feels too slow. It starts off way too long and slow. Then there are two middle sections both of which are a little too long, then a long lead up to the end and then the actual end. The returning characters are great but the new ones are just nothing. I still remember Tess, Bill, David, Sam, Henry, Marlene and even Ish from the first game. But I can’t remember the names of these side characters and I don’t care enough to look them up. The story is a mix of highs and lows there are some excellent moments and I really liked the ending. But there are plenty of moments that just do not land at all and so much that I just didn’t connect with. The whole thing is too contrived as well.

The other big issues I have are no multiplayer and no replayability. The Factions multiplayer was so damn good in the first game and I know a lot of people won’t understand it but for me it was one the best multiplayer experiences ever and a big part of why I bought the remaster. It hurts that it just isn’t here and still to this day there is no new multiplayer released. I also can’t bring myself to play through this more than twice, which was enough to get the platinum trophy, even though I finished the first game 7 times. It’s too long and bloated and wastes too much time and the gameplay isn’t enough to pull me back in.

The Last of Us Part 2 is a must play for anyone that played the first game and if you haven’t then what are you doing here, go play the first one. You really should play this for yourself. Don’t listen to the mainstream critics or the angry gamers. Play it and form your own opinions. I think it is a really good but uneven game and I would still easily recommend it."

Lucasts_,"Jun 7, 2023",10,"The Last of Us Part II is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. Set five years after The Last of Us (2013), the game focuses on two playable characters in a post-apocalyptic United States whose lives intertwine: Ellie, who sets out in revenge for a murder, and Abby, a soldier who becomes involved in a conflict between her militia and a religious cult. The game uses a third-person perspective; the player must fight human enemies and cannibalistic zombie-like creatures with firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth."
EloisaSemH,"Jun 7, 2023",10,"First things first: if you stopped playing because of the beginning and came here to complain or just because Ellie is a lesbian, you are nothing more than a cry baby. Yeah, I agree that is a strong and hard beginning, but i must say that they were brave doing that. Complete worth it playing afterwords, you can see how revenge can destroy one person, and that no one is right and no one is wrong. Life is complex, it's gray. Everyone is a bad guy in someone else history. A beautiful game to admire by the graphics and to think with the story. Congratulations, Naught Dog, you guys made another masterpiece."

MrEBE,"Jun 5, 2023",1,"Saying that I disliked this game would be an insult to every games I disliked..

This game goes far beyond ""subverting expectations"", far beyond ""disrespecting the people who literally built your success.."", it goes far beyond anything I thought could be possible! And I say this even after Star Wars VIII !! Here are the same mechanisms, again and **** hijack some iconic product, some whole franchise, some whole fanbase, hijack them to bring them where you, some extraordinary minor but extraordinary ultra radical minority, want them to be put!

You know that if you did, by yourself, create a completely NEW product completely in line with your ultra radical political agenda, you know that this product would not pass the number of a couple of thousands sold copies !! (Even more without the false advertising you are experts at !)

So you hijack some big names which by themselves, you know it, will sell millions of copies! That's your kind of people's strategy, here and everywhere, again and again! Of course, false advertising is professionally applied!

And this game set a new record in that strategy! Congratz to you! But you'll learn that many, many, many people can acknowledge them being fooled once! But you'll learn that they are learning too !

As it is said : Vote and express Yourself with your wallet !!
I don't need nor want to swear, just believe me when I say that never ever will I buy any more product from Naught Dog!

Here are my ratings :

1 point for the technical side of that ""game"". That point goes to you all, the tech devs..

0 point for.. everything else.
The scenario is one of the worst I played, and you can repeat this appreciation to everything else (Artistic design, character design, scenario, originality, ""respect"" of the franchise, ""respect"" of the gamers, ""respect"" of anything of value in the franchise)

So that's a score of 1/10.. but I really should remove 1 point to respond to all the 10/10.. Adapting myself to the audience here around.. but no.. here too, I'll keep the respect I have for myself..

Some final words :
Thank you Naughty dog for making me a ""different"" gamer! You indeed made me ""progress"". I'm now open to spoilers! I'm now ultra careful before buying any AAA or any big franchise's products ! I'm now far more radical, following your example, with my opinions and search criterias !

I was a radical ""no spoil"" gamer.. since TLOU2 now I simply cannot and will never ever again preorder any games! I'll patiently wait for real people's reviews and for real people's feedbacks before thinking of acquiring any game ! Thank you soo much Naughty Dog!

Saying that I disliked this game would be an insult to every games I disliked..

Can't wait to see how will perform your next games.. I predict the same things as for Star Wars (you fool and totally disrespect people once, but you should not be able to repeat the process..)"

Full Game Review:
The Last Of Us Part II is the sequel of the first game The Last Of Us. The game is very misunderstood especially from the people who hate the game. The game is a near perfect masterpiece. The gameplay is brilliant way better than the original and the graphics are amazing. The story is actually very well written although it has its flaws it’s still very enjoyable and engaging.  Ellie and Abby are very well written characters. Overall it’s not better than the original it still holds it’s own with the amazing gameplay and story."

Blue9710x,"May 29, 2023",7,"I am very mixed about this game because for almost every positive I have, there is a negative that counteracts the positive. Like how on one hand, the story takes many risks that pay off tremendously for me. But on the other hand, there are just some really messy parts that mess up the story for me. The game preaches how revenge is meaningless/a never ending cycle but doesn't give me the choice to avoid killing enemies. I could go on and on with stuff like this but I think I'll just end now. The only thing I can't complain about is the graphics and visuals. Even as of 2023, this game is stunning. Also can everyone stop arguing like this is the worst thing ever? I understand if the risks the story takes don't work for you, but don't trash the developers and cast for these risks or for being too political. Overall, this game isn't great but it also isn't bad. It does a lot right but stumbles at the same time."

Simbabwe1,"May 23, 2023",5,"I really don't know if I like it. It's been 2 years since I played TLOU2 and I'm still undecided and I don't know if that was their intention. I think they tried to make a controversial story but the execution I think is more negative than not. It didn't make me think or longer on the story, it just made me think this game could've been cut in half and still been as effective.

The gameplay is very solid. Guns, melee, stealth i.e. all the combat is very satisfying and fluid for me. However that's kind of all there is. Story sections with characters walking and talking and then combat sections. It's nice that there's more combat in this one and less puzzles but it's story feels so forced.

I could see what was coming ahead and when I hoped to be surprised I was not. They force you to spend time with the opposing side to make you feel for both of them however I think it just wasn't done naturally. It feels forced like they are cramming Abbie and her very odd personality down your throat. Showing her pros and cons for a very long section of the game where all I wanted was to get back to Ellie, the character I had followed throughout the last game and expected to do so in this one. If we had smaller Abbie sections, I think it could've hit us much better but forcing 8 hours of Abbie actually makes me feel less for her.

The game itself is a technical achievement. Incredible visuals, awesome combat but the experience is let down by the forced story moments that outstay their welcome. 5/10."

tadnid,"May 17, 2023",0,"I heard it was bad, I saw the ratings, but I never imagined it would be such a disaster.

Without spoiling anything, here are things you should consider before trying this game.

Pros: The graphics are fantastic. That's all.

Now for the rest:
(1) This is not a horror game. If it was a movie, it would be tagged as ""drama"", then ""action"" maybe. You are not escaping some evil or hoping to find survive to reach some destination. In this game you are the hunter. If there is any horror, it's you. The whole game is about a quest for revenge. In doing so, you will butcher countless humans. There are still some infected (zombies) here and there, but they are more like random critters, not at all the main focus.

(2) This is the main problem. You play as various characters, but they are all detestable, including Ellie. I've never hated main characters that much before. If it was a movie it would be alright perhaps. But sticking such long hours commanding a character that you hate on a quest that you reject makes enjoying the game impossible. I still watched the story to the end, and believe me, it only gets worse. In the last hour of the game, I was like, are you for real !!!

(3) As others commented, the game has a lot of political messages here and there. As a mature individual I don't care, but the problem is with influenceable kids playing the game. And no matter what the rating is, kids will always play all kind of games. Then it becomes a problem what they are being told.

I believe this game killed the franchise. The only way they could release another game in this series is by moving completely away from this horrible cast."

zNeverSleep,"May 14, 2023",10,"I simply don't have words to describe how good this game is.

Luckily, I had the opportunity to play this game and its precursory at once. That was crucial to my experience since Part II is an organic peace of Part 1. Why? well, let me explain. Basically, all events of Part 2 happen as consequences of the epilogue of Part 1. All the development we saw involving Joe and Ellie is elevated to extremes. But you have to play the first game to feel it. Going straight to the point, the prologue shows how impactful the new engine is. I played the Part 1 remake and was incredible, but still tied in the PS3 script. Here, there is no limit. It`s almost unbelievable to believe that this runs in a PS4. The expressions, lightning, physics. My god, is so verossimile. The gore though... insane. After that shocking beginning, we go thirsty to get our revenge. Fortunately, this game just shows us how important a perspective is. At first, I didn't like the Abby section. But when I started to get involved by the scars arc, man... I was totally into it.

This game is a study of human nature, such as Game of Thrones and Red Dead Redemption. Its connections to the first game add to the original narrative and integrate even more into the discussion about what we do for love. Powerful story. Unfortunately, since English is not my mother language, I really can't express myself about how impactful this game was for me. But anyway, I know you understand me if you played as I did."

There is timing and skill to use the 'shock' value in order to benefit the story or enrich the characters, but that is not the case here. I've never been more disappointed in my life with a game than this one. It promised me one thing and secretly put something else in as a replacement. This game lied, swapped what it advertised for something gross and spat in the face of its fans.

rednival,"May 8, 2023",9,"While I will not spoil the story, I will allude to my take on the overall tone of the plot and make reference to a gameplay change that happens mid-way through, so I leave it up to you if that's too much.

You’ve been warned.

The Last of Us 2 is easily one of the most divisive games of all time. It makes some bold choices in its story telling that many do not like; however, the greatness of gameplay is often lost in this debate. In terms of gameplay, the game builds on everything the first game did well. The Last of Us was fun, but the story and enemy design did a lot of the heavy lifting. This time around, there is more of game worth playing, even if you don't care for the story. There is a point in the game where the character stats reset, and, again, this is divisive. Contrary to how some have put it, you are not redoing everything you’ve already done; however, it’s not a totally new gameplay experience either.  It changes up some skills and craftable items, but that’s about it. If you think this will annoy you, keep that in mind. For what it's worth, I barely thought twice about this until I saw so many people being upset by it.

Now, on to the story, which is much harder to discuss spoiler free, so I am going to try and be a bit objective.

I think you owe it to yourself to play this game and formulate your own take on its story. In the end, Sony and Naughty Dog are taking big risks on this series. It paid off in the first game and was (nearly) universally praised by critics and fans. This time, it's is far more divisive. Like the first game, the story is not meant to be satisfying. It's meant to be true to the characters and world in which they exist. It's a credit to the writers of the sequel that it never feels like they are trying to outdo the original. They're just trying to continue the story. They make some very bold decisions here, and these do overflow into the game’s design and create scenarios you may not enjoy, and I do not believe you are meant to. It was my opinion that these situations felt organic to the story, and, especially the characters, and not forced. If you want a game that makes you feel comfortable all the time, this is not the game for you.

As for the ending, I understand a lot of the criticism there, but I was more ok with it than most; however, your mileage will vary depending on how attached or unattached you are to characters. You experience with narratives outside of video games will likely influence your thoughts as well.

In summary, I think this good game for every gamer to play as you can have fun while having your expectations challenged. If you go in with this expectation, you'll likely walk away with a more positive opinion than most.

It is a miracle that we get to have a stories like this in AAA titles. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, appreciate what you can, while you can. I am concerned gamers will start pushing back on challenging stories, just as movie goers did with film. It's quite likely that, one day, all AAA game stories will be as formulaic, predicable, and full of fan service as the modern movie blockbuster."
JeffereyDahmer,"May 7, 2023",0,Last Of Us Part II is on the same level as cow dung. This game is crap. Story was uninteresting. Woke Neil **** dogsh**. Avoid at all costs.

Reached,"May 6, 2023",1,A leftist wet dream infused in a high production AAA offering. Pure propaganda.
MWS2008,"May 6, 2023",7,"So, I recently played the last of us 1 for the first time and loved it. It has become one of my favorite games I have played, so when I heard the sequel had gotten mixed thoughts from fans, I came into The Last of Us Part II hopefully optimistic and I liked it a lot. Nowhere near as good as the first, but still good. The gameplay is fantastic. Even on normal difficulty it can get really challenging. There isn't always a lot of ammo and shooting both people and infected has never felt so fun. The stealth was also so fun and so filled with tension. The story is where this game kinda falls apart. There are a lot of plot holes and contrivances. I also thought that the game was kinda in the wrong order. You first play as Ellie and then you play as another character and you play through the same days as you did Ellie. If you rearrange the scenes, it becomes a lot less messy. At first, the direction the story took seemed baffling, but over time, I grew to understand why they took the route they took. Another problem is that many of the character deaths don't have that huge of an effect  on the story. Other than that though... Idk, I didn't really hate this at all. This was great. To me personally, plot holes don't really ruin a story for me, unless there is nothing holding the story together and I wouldn't really say that counts for this game. I liked this a lot and if you don't, that's fine, but don't get mad at me just because I liked a game you didn't. I liked this a lot and even with the huge story problems, I still couldn't not like this a lot.  Hot take, I know."
Gamer2068,"May 6, 2023",0,Game destroys the entire purposed of TLoU part 1. Fireflies planned to keep Ellie sedated and kill her without talking to her or Joel. He did the right thing. on part 2 they just make it out to be as wet he did was wrong. This game was so uncomfortable to play. Sick developers. This game made people feel so miserable. First time I regret spending money on a game.
Tommosas,"May 5, 2023",5,"In my opinion the best game of all time. The story it's a masterpiece, the atmosphere between us and the characters it's very immersive and the locations and graphics much."
ANovoa,"May 5, 2023",10,"It was an excellent game that I enjoyed from head to toe, it made me feel many emotions and at the same time I wanted to continue with the story, the fact that the events of the game happened that way made me see a very human story of revenge, redemption and of course peace with oneself, I wish with all my heart to have a third installment and to enjoy once again the company of the protagonists and some more memories."

Cisum420,"May 3, 2023",8,"The game is absolutely insane. Gameplay, graphics, music, story are very nice. I like the story of Ellie and Abby. When I started to play Abby, I dreamed about her death as fast as possible, but later, I realised that her life has a lot of pain because of Joel and Ellie.

Abby had a lot of reasons to kill Joel and developers showed that Joel's actions have a lot of consequences.

Actually, player think that Abby's revenge is because of lost opportunity to create a vaccine, but no.

Im okay with LGBT relationship, i think it can abuse people with personal problems or those who cant accept their lesbian or **** part in themselves. A lot of negatives reviews dated on June 19, 2020, in a day of release.

Those who finished the game understand that its inpossible to finish the game in one day, so the hate is based on Joel's death. Okay, its your right, but its not worth to punish the good game only because it did not meet your expectations.

I love Naughty Dogs for all their games and TLOU 2 is absolutely must play.

I finished game only on 2023, and it still better that a lot of fresh releases.

Don't cry about spending money and being cheated, rather weep over the plight of Ellie and Abby"
CHAR1TH,"May 3, 2023",9,"yet again, another amazing game from naughty dog, the story is beautifully written, most people were already spoiled before playing which made them angry and i dont blame them for it , and most people didnt accept the facts which took place in the game, thats with the story. Now moving on to gameplay, i cant express in words how good the gameplay might be one of the most realistic gameplay out there, its a must buy game if you loved tlou."
Keldrath,"May 3, 2023",10,This is one of the most amazing games ever made by mankind and still gonna be praised in the future just like we praise masterpieces like Monalisa and Beethoven's 5th symphony.

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

The Last of Us Part 2 is a prime example **** that prioritizes pushing a supposed ""LGBT agenda"" over delivering a compelling and enjoyable experience. This sequel is marred by heavy-handed and forced attempts at inclusivity, overshadowing any potential for a well-crafted story and engaging gameplay.

Rather than focusing on the characters and their development, the game seems more interested in hammering its progressive messaging into the player's consciousness. The inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters feels contrived and unnecessary, as their sexual orientation becomes their defining trait rather than an aspect of their identity. The narrative sacrifices depth and coherence to virtue signal, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying storyline.

Unfortunately, this obsession with inclusivity negatively impacts the gameplay as well. The forced diversity feels more like tokenism, with the game's agenda taking precedence over meaningful gameplay mechanics. It's clear that the developers prioritized their message over creating a polished and enjoyable gaming experience.

In addition to the narrative shortcomings, the gameplay itself is riddled with flaws. The combat encounters lack innovation and fail to offer any real challenge, while the stealth mechanics feel clunky and unrefined. The pacing is uneven, with stretches of repetitive gameplay that make the experience monotonous and tedious.

Furthermore, technical issues plague the game, with frequent frame rate drops and glitches that disrupt immersion and undermine the overall experience. It's disheartening to see a game of this magnitude released with such significant technical shortcomings.

Ultimately, The Last of Us Part 2's preoccupation with pushing an ""LGBT agenda"" at the expense of a well-crafted narrative and enjoyable gameplay is a disservice to the potential of the franchise. Instead of embracing diversity in a meaningful way, the game comes across as pandering and lacks the substance that made its predecessor so memorable. It's a missed opportunity and a disappointing addition to the series ."

Maafe,"Apr 28, 2023",10,"Beautiful game that beautifuly showcases and executes the complexity of human actions and emotions, the outcomes of revenge and mostly the ironic unnecesserity of it. Even though player choice is a subject to be disscussed, it is intentionally not allowed and it's ambitiousness is something to be appreciated."

dorpido,"Apr 27, 2023",10,"This game was a different experience altogether. The gameplay is amazing, the environment is beautiful and the story hits you right in the feels. The game is long by NaughtyDog standard but every passing minutes the gameplay gets intense and dark. The story slows down at towards the mid sections of the game but pace picks up back again soon."
chambersix,"Apr 26, 2023",1,"Nothing compared to the first game, I recently played the first game for the first time and I was really excited to jump right into this one, I had no idea how disappointed I would soon be. Did they completely fire the original team and hire some budget hacks?"

NateDalton06,"Apr 26, 2023",8,"I played the first and second one back to back and knowing most of the major plots but that didn't take away from the experience for me. I wont lie I thought the first game was good but I did have very low expectations for the second, to my surprise it smashed those expectations out of the park though with phenomenal graphics and game play which no other game compares to. The story was also good and I enjoyed both Ellie's and Abby's sections thoroughly, overall I do prefer the second game to the first but mostly for the cinematic gameplay."

The problem is not what happened in the story, the problem is the way it was written in is just simply bad writing, and is not worthy of the name."

Sem contar nos adiamentos resultaram no vazamento do jogo.
FRACASSO DA DÉCADA!

A complete disappointment, I waited almost a decade for a game so disappointing in terms of script(change in direction). The Last of Us 1 was flawless in that regard.  Tlou part 2 failed with fake trailers at E3 2017 and beyond, (through Sony's fault) failed to deliver the factions online and mainly due to leaks before the date.

I've written several paragraph-long rants on why this is a broken story, I'm not gonna do that here. If I could describe this game in one word, it's this: Disrepectful.

It disrespects the original story, its characters, and its fans. There are several plot holes but people circlejerk the brand so hard that they just overlook them. I'm a huge PS fan, I'm a huge fan of Last of Us 1, but I can't just lie to myself and say this was a good sequel. I think a 5.8 user score is too high, deserves a 2 or 3 imo"
