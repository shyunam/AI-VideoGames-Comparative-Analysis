Joseph_Murdok,"Jun 12, 2024",3,"Boring story, all is the same (open world is only for GTA, Halo is for single missions) everything is UNSC, UNSC, where is an elite story mode? Damn microtransactions, NO PLAYABLE ELITES, not being able to select the colors you want in multiplayer, multiplayer maps are all humans, no variety of ANYTHING with 343 Halo has been bulsh/t, bring back the playable elites, bulsh/t 343"
DontBeAJinx,"Jun 6, 2024",8,"the open world added to the story of Halo is nice... different from the other games, no interest in multiplayer but the campaign was good.."
LePuh,"May 28, 2024",10,A really goodlooking and playeble Halo. The OW is awesome and is a masterpice in the HAlo universum
JamieMoran,"May 27, 2024",2,"Really poor addition to what was a great series. Multiplayer is broken and the maps are just not fun.

The campaign…I don’t know where to start! It just doesn’t hit like the others.

An iconic Xbox mascot dragged through the dirt and ruined."
redboy13,"May 27, 2024",7,"This game have all to be one of the best, but incompetent decisions of 343 and Microsoft kill it. such a shame to have a game with awesome potential and throw it to the garbage with **** ass micro transactions"
dragonsCarnage,"May 25, 2024",9,"After Halo Guardians, it seems they came back to what was good about Halo. Decent story, really fun to play"
Brothe,"May 25, 2024",10,"Perfection
This game is just amazing Whether It's The amazing multiplayer or the spectacular story this game is just perfect play it NOW"
Marinesg,"May 23, 2024",7,"Bueno en papel, malo en ejecución.

Halo Infinite, aunque es un viaje a sus raíces, se queda corto con lo que la saga Halo representa. Es un juego que, en su mayoría, se siente como una versión beta y recortada de un título que quiere hacer mucho y abarca poco.

Positivo:
.Jugabilidad renovada y adictiva
.Gráficos y ambiente

.Negativo:
.Misiones un poco sosas
.Poco avance en la historia y solo pequeños momentos memorables."
SushiKiller,"May 23, 2024",1,"Very classic, but not in a good way. A bad COD unfortunately. No originality, graphically not ugly but not cute either."
Scwarf,"May 22, 2024",10,Great game. I play multiplayer mostly and I think 343 have made a great version of Halo.

Rysak23,"May 18, 2024",4,"Как подобный высер реально вышел в 2021 году, мне крайне сложно понять. Абсолютно безликий и банальный арт дизайн, неинтересный и скучный сюжет, отвратительная, просто блять уебищная графика для игры 2021 года. И СУКА НЕВЫНОСИМЫЙ ОДНОТИПНЫЙ УЕБАНСКИЙ ТИР. Как блять можно играть в хуйню, где на тебя одного бегут десятки, я не преувеличиваю и не утрирую, десятки ебаных мобов, бегущихна тебя. Я очень надеюсь, что на Xbox эта хуета набрала 7.8 баллов из-за накрутки, но никак не потому что фанаты этого говна такие тупые. Ну либо из-за мультиплеера. Потому что когда до 3 часа игры добрались лишь только 20 процентов игроков, это говорит о том, что не только я в сюжет этой дресни недоиграл.

Скинул этот кал на 5 часу"
mulkster77,"May 15, 2024",10,Pure fun like the good ole days. Would love campaign updates. I like swinging from the grapple.
Bowber,"May 12, 2024",8,"From The down fall of Halo 5, this game really give you hope that there is still more for the chef waiting. Halo infinite brings the best parts of Halo back to life in a epic open world fill with objectives and new exclusive weapons. The story feels off and not that good with addition like the Endless which really takes the spot light off the flood. The game really brings you back to the first game with that old Masterchef look that you take resemblance from Halo 2 and 3. This is a great reminisce of the original game the Bungie put to order and an expansive world to go with."
Zelarido,"Apr 28, 2024",10,"They definitely fixed the issues they had with the story in the previous games. Also, the Multiplayer is as fun as ever and free!"
yousufv1,"Apr 18, 2024",9,This game is absolutely amazing. It was a bit underwhelming but other than that this is amazing
D3KU2511,"Apr 10, 2024",9,"Easily one of my favorite halo games, the campaign is one of my favorites, and the last time I played a multiplayer for any game this much was back on halo 3. Had a rough launch, but the movement in this game feels so amazing."
edenlie,"Apr 9, 2024",7,"game is not bad but for me is the worst of the series, story is not so good.
I was expecting a turning point then the game ended leaving me with bitter taste.
open world is a little boring"

CGnomazoid,"Apr 4, 2024",6,"It's such a shame that such a good foundation has been completely abandoned. The current 'season' is just a single meme mode as far as I can tell. Player counts dwindling... What happened? The campaign is pretty lame, but the weapon is one of my favorite AI waifus don't me."
Jojogamer_,"Mar 30, 2024",0,Ranking System ist komplett dumm mit diesem beschissenen unsichtbaren rang. im meine wie dumm muss man im Kopf sein um so etwas in sein spieleinzubauen. Ansonsten 10/10
Kipperfaust,"Mar 26, 2024",8,"Missing lots of content at launch, took a year and a half to get to the state it should have been, but we finally have a complete game. Campaign is a good play the first time around, but after that, the flaws start to show. Art style is closer to the original trilogy, which but feels like it's at the expense of the graphical fidelity that 4 and 5 brought to the franchise. Don't expect a masterpiece, but it's still a great new addition to the Halo franchise, especially the multiplayer."
epyc_ryze,"Oct 20, 2023",10,"As a co-op shooter, the game simply has no competition in this form. It may not be the best part of the series and open world is simply not for Halo, but the gameplay and gunplay are still absolutely top class. The game is so much fun in coop and graphics and sound are really good."
AngainorG7,"Mar 16, 2024",10,Best multiplayer ever. Addictive and beautiful. Great campaign. The future of Halo is bright. It can only go up from here.
ebodur,"Mar 9, 2024",8,Captures the essence of classic Halo with a modern twist. Needs more depth and content to truly stand out.
AlanBR1998,"Mar 8, 2024",9,"Excelente o fato deles terem trazido os mapas abertos de volta, gameplay sensacional, enredo bom mas poderia ser melhor, no geral, muito bom jogo!"
HomicideJake,"Mar 3, 2024",10,"Halo Infinite is amazing return to roots for the Halo games, the gameplay is the closest to older Halo titles with its modernized movement makes it a stand out experience for Halo games. The return to classic aesthetics and design is also a very welcome return. Spartan customization is the best it has ever been in any game to date and PvP is extremely fun and competitive. 

As for the Campaign it’s a stellar experience, good fun boss fights and its well designed encounters with an extremely fun sandbox make it feel very enjoyable and even more so with friends. Most people will complain about the open world part of it but it’s fun to explore with the grapple hook and look at the gorgeous scenery. It’s also good to see Chief be humanized in the story and the buildup for the next game is amazing. 10/10."
V1RG1L,"Mar 2, 2024",9,"Campaign is excellent, polished and provides excellent replay value. Multiplayer has become very polished, with a variety of game modes and great competitive play."
TSM715,"Feb 22, 2024",10,"The first proper good Halo game by 343 studios. The best gunplay in the series to date with a great story, multiplayer is fun and well supported."

AD1212,"Feb 9, 2024",8,"A very solid game with a solid Single Player and an addictive Multiplayer. It is fast paced, has good weapon variety, and a huge following that will support the game for years on end. The problem is that 343i is still at the helm and they did a lot of crap that they did in Halo 5 that no one really liked. The multiplayer while fun is still spare in content and game modes. I hate how in modern gaming people think it's ok to release games unfinished or half assed and expect us to be ok with waiting forever on some updates that might make the game complete or whole again. Unfortunately while Halo Infinite is a good game it is one of the biggest offenders of this trend."
GorineitorAkagi,"Feb 8, 2024",10,"El mejor juego de campaña con coop y un multijudaro genial , me gustan mucho la skins que estan poniendo , el multi va muy bien me encuentra partida en 30 segundos"
sacroyalty,"Feb 5, 2024",10,"I played this some on launch and recently came back to it. It is a smooth game, with a lot going for it and it's free which is wild!

I enjoyed my time playing custom games, plus original feeling Halo high paced action."
Funky_Nick,"Feb 1, 2024",10,Best 343 halo out there. The new spirit of fire update 10/10. I do want them to bring back entrenched though.
9696115,"Jan 31, 2024",10,Undoubtedly one of the best halo games. By far 343's best halo game. The online has been worked on hard by the devs and is now the best online game i have ever played. I highly recomend this game
RECSTON,"Jan 30, 2024",10,STUPENDO!!!Non ho mai visto un gioco dallo stile di battaglia cosi' bello!!!
JuanFer080,"Jan 27, 2024",10,"Jugué toda la saga de Halo desde sus inicios, cada entrega evolucionaba, unas mejores que otras, pero Halo Infinite me parece una obra maestra, la evolución que tuvo con Halo 5 fue brutal, tiene cosas mejorables como más biomas, pantalla dividida pero el salto que dio lo compensa, muchos se quejan, pero la verdad no se puede negar el gran trabajo técnico, artístico y la calidad que hay de tras de este gran juego."

Infinite a une campagne encore plus claquée que celle de Halo 5 et le multijoueurs manque toujours de modes et de cartes malgré les nombreuses majs. Et puis 343 Industries a annoncé arrêté les saisons récemment, on est donc déjà sur la fin de vie du jeu alors qu'il était prévu pour durer 10 ans x)"

memus,"Jan 14, 2024",8,"Probably, the first decent Halo campaign since Reach. The game would be even 9/10 if it were more technically polished."
grantmagott,"Jan 7, 2024",8,"Campaign is a huge step forward for 343, not halo 2 or 3 tier campaign but way better than 4 and 5 and I hope for a dlc soon. I haven’t played much multi lately but I still hear that the micro tractions are still pretty crazy, but the multi is still overall good fun like from the old halo games, however the flying vehicles are a bit too OP in my opinion and they NEED to remove SBMM, I’m not that great at the game but when I get a good 15-20 kill game I’m all of a sudden playing against pros the next match."
Netherghul,"Dec 27, 2023",6,"Another disappointment for the Halo Franchise. Even after all the drip fed content it still doesnt live up to its promises. Doesn't feel like Halo at all the progression system (after they finally added it!) isnt rewarding at all. Half of the maps are lazy recreations that play terribly compared to the originals. 343i can not design maps. Halo infinite, forever the horrible 343 wannabe of Halo Reach."
Japan_ab,"Dec 26, 2023",9,"Buen videojuego, masacrado por la desesperación e impaciencia de algunos usuarios con las temporadas del multijugador. Un tirador exquisito. La historia es buena y se acompaña con la intriga de cortana, variedad de enemigos y escenarios. Las texturas y los gráficos son tremendos."
TwoBe,"Dec 24, 2023",7,"Halo Infinite is undoubtedly a fun game that brings back the nostalgia of the early Halo titles. The gameplay is solid, and it's clear that the developers aimed to recapture the essence of the franchise's roots.

The new Cortana design though... is just plain ugly. They took a beloved character and gave her a makeover that's simply unappealing. It's disappointing to see such a drastic departure from the iconic look that fans know and love. They really missed the mark with this one. 

As for the plot, I can't help but feel disappointed by the direction of the story. Frankly, I wish they had taken a different approach after defeating the Flood, the fact they want to fixed their screw up of making the FORERUNNERs evil along with Cortana says it all, honestly they just should start all over."
drlowdon,"Dec 19, 2023",6,"The combat is as satisfying as ever, especially with the addition of the grappling hook, but the generic open world ruins the pacing that made earlier Halo games so entertaining, and you still spend too much time being funnelled down dull grey corridors. 

The multiplayer, whilst not something I’m particularly interested in, offers pretty much what you’d expect from the series."
Raysquizy2003,"Dec 18, 2023",10,This game started off really rough but they have really brand it back. Multiplayer is a blast and the campaign was always good

Marlon54,"Dec 2, 2023",10,coming from halo5 this game feels more like halo campain is really good and boss fight feel smooth i feel the mutiplayer is the best part of this game
vinzerivera,"Nov 29, 2023",10,"A game that since day one the campaign was back to form statement. The semi open world although not to elaborate, is the correct direction for this saga. The story, arts style, physics and over all connecting elements provided a breath of freash air. Multiplayer although a rough start we all know the fantastic state is in."
ElInsqno,"Nov 18, 2023",10,Uno de los mejores juegos de la saga despues del 2 y el 3son muy buenos eventos los unico maloson las microtransacciones ya que los demas halo nl tienen eso del resto es uno de mis titulos favoritos
Americanricher,"Nov 17, 2023",9,"the controls are fine altho they lack a little stiff from the others, also the open world is bad for the series"
tjeff148,"Nov 14, 2023",9,Some of the most fun I've had in a Halo campaign (or a game in general). It's a Halo game with modern but not with the gritty art style 4 and 5 have. So that's pretty damn good if you ask me.
NightWolf_,"Nov 11, 2023",10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
Bibbo_Lele,"Nov 10, 2023",10,"Il miglior FPS fantascientifico. Il 10 è più per affetto personale e per compensare i soliti voti ingiusti, ma oggettivamente è un voto distinto pieno. Sì deve considerare che 343 ha voluto osare, sperimentando l'open world su Halo. Avrebbe potuto dare di più sicuramente, ma forse quello che funziona meno è proprio il mondo aperto. Potrebbe essere nella coerenza del gioco il fatto che ci sia poco movimento in giro (visto che è ambientato su un'anello semi-distrutto e conquistato dagli esiliati), ma dove brilla Halo Infinite è proprio nelle zone più contenute.
La trama della campagna la trovo un pochino migliore di quella del 5. Ho provato quasi dei brividi verso metà /conclusione del gioco, ma sembra quasi ""bruscamente"" interrotta. Il pensiero va ai possibili DLC o campagne aggiuntive che erano previsti per poi essere cancellati. Comunque la voglia di vedere un seguito è tanta, è questo che si prova nel finale, ma dovremmo aspettare parecchio penso.
Il gameplay è un diamante del genere (il gunplay specialmente), anche se nella cura dei dettagli era migliore il 5 : per esempio la ""dashboard"" di mira /mirino di ogni arma , in quest'ultimo, era diversa da arma ad arma. In Infinite invece il mirino è quasi sempre lo stesso, ma il feedback delle armi è davvero appagante.
Il multiplayer non è il mio campo preferito nei giochi, ma quello di Halo è sempre stato l'eccezione. Anche questa volta mi ha preso come pochi, anche se all'uscita aveva meno mappe e meno modalità. 
Nota di demerito (per i miei gusti personali), le mappe dovrebbero essere più coerenti alla campagna del gioco, se uno non conoscesse Halo ed entrasse in una partita di quest'ultimo , farebbe davvero fatica a distinguerlo da altri giochi riguardo le ambientazioni.
Ultima nota di demerito (questa per me vale più di altre), l'assenza della Campagna il COOP-LOCALE!!!
Con mio fratello abbiamo sempre giocato e rigiocato gli Halo con schermo condiviso (tranne il 5 e purtroppo INFINITE), sarebbe bello se un giorno la inserissero di nuovo."

atainan,"Nov 6, 2023",7,"My first Xbox game, gameplay is quite repeating but there is a deep story in it. Could not get it exactly but I think it is related to not playing other games of the series."
Joseppi97,"Nov 6, 2023",9,Back to form. Far from the best Halo but the best experience we have had since Reach. Need more variety in Campaign though
Carvicedo,"Nov 6, 2023",9,"Acabo de tomar la decisión de darle una oportunidad a la campaña, y puedo asegurarte que es el mejor juego shooter en mucho tiempo. Adrenalina pura, combates frenéticos y realmente el mapa y las misiones secundarias son un gran acierto."

xavierj-86,"Nov 2, 2023",7,"I only played ""Halo 5 Guardians,"" and I liked it. When Halo Infinite was released, I decided to play. Then I finished the game. I have mixed feelings about the game. The multiplayer is OK; the main story is my problem; it's not a bad game, but the campaign open world feels repetitive and vacuum. The gun play is fun, the bosses are good, and the last boss is really hard. But when you go back to doing the side quest, most of the missions are repetitive and easy; above all, when you have the tank, it's like going for a walk. I think the game overall is okay. But in the graphics and design world, Halo 5 is better than Halo Infinite. My final score is 7/10."

The Mulitplayer playlisthas been revamped and is non stop action and fun no matter what game mode you are playing, forge and custom games allow for a break in teh action to give new experiences everytime. Plus the actual Campign itself boosters a good story in the ""soft"" reebot that they were shooting for. And with 343 basically new team and leadership, You have to have hope that Halo is offically BACK"
yekimevol,"Oct 19, 2023",6,"This review is of the campaign and not MP.

To take one of the greatest liner single player  FPS campaign franchises and to change it into a poor imitation of farcry was a very surprising disappointment. Very repetitive environments, boring health bar enemies and the classic halo arsenal hidden behind filler content.

Compare that to the original all the way back in 2001; gorgeous varied environments, perfect gameplay and enticing story."
ShmackingJug,"Oct 19, 2023",9,"this game is nowhere near as perfect as some of the Halo games before it however i believe that the story of this game can stand on its own and that it holds the formula for the Halo games of the future.

when playing online you do seem to spend a while finding a match but when you do you know the round will be fun. at the time of writing season 5 has just been released and is bringing many people back to the game."
mrhayden,"Oct 18, 2023",10,the combat is just like the old game it is amazing don't really to much bad with it i get it was a bit buggy but other then that it's great andin season 5 of the game it's better then it ever was
agent13,"Oct 17, 2023",3,"Halo Infinite is an underwhelming disappointment in both campaign and multiplayer, comparing to other shooter games halo infinite has a dull and unrealistic gunplay and the animations are horrible. the campaign is very tedious because the open world makes it sometimes extremely difficult to reach your objectives as mountains often stop you and I was stuck not knowing where to go. the plot of the game isn't interesting either. the multiplayer becomes boring even faster than the campaign. overall making halo openworld was a huge mistake which ruined the player experience."
Tiedblade,"Oct 17, 2023",8,"Great in so many ways. Let down by poor atmosphere/music. poorly implemented story elements and a lack of diversity. I thought this Halo would re-capture the mystery and comradery of Halo CE. It seems maybe they were heading in the right direction and ran out of time. 
More biomes, more enemy types more special events, a better story, some work on atmosphere/music and set pieces would make this game perfect for me. Instead its just good."
RoninWatari,"Oct 17, 2023",9,Very good campaign and multi-player has come back around. They've improved the multi-player 10 fold. Definitely recommend coming back to give it a try!

Danishabu,"Oct 16, 2023",10,Uno de los mejores juegos la historia enganchay el online súper divertido
Myagiwhoa,"Oct 16, 2023",9,"Definitely the best Halo game from 343. The graphics are actually very nice. Especially with the ability to play at 120fps. The grapple is a game changer and probably the biggest addition from a gameplay perspective the series has had thus far. 

The story is one of the best in the series. Much better story than Halo 5 by far. This game felt like Halo 1 and Halo 3 had a baby

Only thing is they should of released splitscreen co-op for Series X consoles. Series s is the reason we don’t have it because if parity. 

The open world didn’t add much and was really the thing I disliked most. But I wont hold it against them for trying something new. We can’t complain about milking and lack of innovation and not let the devs try new things. 
Now the multiplayer is great heading into season 5. I must say this is then finest Halo since Halo 3."
LeoMorgan,"Oct 13, 2023",8,"ITS THE BEST 343 HALO BY FAR, with that said neither the story, multiplayer, level design, music, or polish is the same asbefr, its structure as an open worldits nothing new but the mechanics and freedom makes it feel likechildhood, and the grapplehook is fun"
Johnnylowfive,"Oct 11, 2023",10,"Best Halo since 3. Adds several things to make it feel modernized but the game is through and through Halo combat and outside GAMEPLAY shouldn't have bearing on the game review.
ABSOLUTELY MUST PLAY FOR ALL FPS/HALO FANS. If it was on PlayStation it would be unbearable to hear the nonstop praise. But it's not a walking sim with 5 hours of cutscenes...."
Jozee,"Oct 9, 2023",7,"Had promise but Halo is a big name to live up to, and Infinite sadly missed the mark"
CCyrax,"Oct 8, 2023",10,"Halo infinite feels like any other halo game and that is good since the master chief adventures are supposed to feel like the problem is getting bigger and bigger and there is always a bigger enemy. The controls and mechanics are quite good, this makes the game feels like a contemporary game. The villain(s) are good, you feel that they'll have their own background story and, of course, their own reasons.
The game is quite good and interesting, also the multiplayer experience is quite good and fun!"
CanyonNerd,"Oct 4, 2023",8,"The multiplayer seems to have finally found its footing nearly 2 years after release. Forge map integration into playlists and the now plethora of game modes has Halo Infinite feeling like Halo again (at least for multiplayer). The new leveling system is a vast improvement from launch and no longer forces to you play specific game types to complete daily challenges. Unfortunately, the upheaval at 343 seems to have taken any glimmer of single player DLC with it, which is a bummer. 

If you haven't played the campaign, it's worth it, but it will leave you wanting more in terms of the potential vs. the outcome. The landscape and enemy bases are recycled throughout the entire map, there's one bland biome, and the ""open world"" is mostly disappointing in terms of discovery (eg Breath of the Wild). At this point, campaign DLC is the only thing in my book that could completely redeem this game from the disaster it was at launch, but something tells it ain't happening."
TheGamerGuide,"Sep 26, 2023",9,"While Halo Infinite's campaign structure is new territory for the series, and will likely divide opinion, it tells a good story, and creates moments that rank it in the top half when it comes to good Halo campaigns. Throw in a phenomenal multiplayer arena and some stellar shooter mechanics, and it's safe to say that 343 has finally put its stamp on the wonderful world of Halo.

TGG – 9 / 10

AUDIO 9/10
Halo Infinite is a blend of old and new when it comes to its score. The old Marty O'Donnell classic riffs are complemented by some new riffs that are clearly heavily influenced by the beats of old, especially Halo 2. It's a very good arrangement, with some solid voice acting to boot.

VISUALS 9/10
Halo Infinite's visuals aren't going to blow you away, that's for sure, but from a purely artistic standpoint, it's a very pretty game. Is it next-gen enough? Probably not, but it’s not a sight for sore eyes. Far from it.

PLAYABILITY 9/10
It's brilliant. There's no other word for it. From a gameplay point of view, Halo Infinite is not only at the top of its game, but one of the best first-person shooters around, from a handling perspective.

DELIVERY 9/10
The open-world campaign is likely to prove divisive, but even beneath the open-world exterior, there's still plenty of narrative-driven and linear sections. Switching structured set pieces for emergent gameplay is certainly a risk, though."
Duffman430,"Sep 26, 2023",9,"The year-long drought of content in multiplayer is now over, and the floodgates have opened. Multiplayer for this title. There's new content every 2 weeks or so. All the major technical issues have been ironed out. The gameplay is excellent."

Dazu eine gute Story, die ich vielleicht nicht 100%-ig verstanden habe, da ich die Vorgänger noch nachholen muss, aber grundsätzlich hatte ich meinen Spaß.

TheGvH,"Aug 21, 2023",0,"Halo Infinite stumbles into the gaming arena with an unfortunate clunkiness that's hard to overlook. Its gameplay feels trapped in a weird limbo between being too dated and not embracing the charm of its nostalgic roots. The question of why this game is free to play lingers like a persistent glitch, as most players would gladly pay a premium for a fully polished and finished AAA product. Regrettably, Halo Infinite fails to deliver on that front, leaving gamers with an underwhelming experience that misses the mark on multiple levels. The prospect of paying a premium for this mishmash of dated design choices and lackluster execution is a hard pass for discerning players seeking a more satisfying and engaging gaming adventure."

Plein de possibilités avec le grappin et toujours plaisant de retrouver le large panel d'armes et de véhicules que la série à construit. J'aime l'orientation prise et le challenge des rencontres avec les cibles et places fortes à libérer. Là où le bas blesse est que j'imagine que cette formule finira par devenir un peu lassante et le manque de variété de l'environnement ne va pas aider à diminuer cette redondance. Qu'importe l'essentiel est là et toujours aussi en forme . Et le multijoueur toujours aussi béton en contenus, modes des jeux , succès et récompenses à débloquer. De ce côté là je suis moins bon et je me fais encore bien défoncer. Donc voilà. J'apprécie et je continue ma petite campagne de ce Halo Infinite."
Aguinar,"Aug 17, 2023",9,"Halo Infinite é uma carta de amor aos fãs e um jogo extremamente consistente, finalmente a 343 conseguiu misturar sua forma de fazer Halo com a formula da classica com o melhor gameplay de todos até agora além da narrativa emocionante e com aquela cinematografia boa da 343 e boa narrativa parecida com a da Bungie.
O problema de Halo Infinite foi a falta de variedade nos cenários principalmente no mundo aberto, além do mundo aberto não ser muito original, sendo que as missões só não se tornam insuportáveis por causa da incrível gunplay e os cenários de tirar o folego.
Para o Fã de Halo esse jogo e a historia são excelentes, mas para o publico em geral ele não é tão convidativo, por causa da historia que precisa de um conhecimento prévio para se prender em momentos muito emocionantes, apesar da historia ser muito boa por si só.
Os gráficos ficaram bem bonitos, apenas pecando nas expressões faciais, mas em questão de performance da dublagem todos mandaram muito bem.
Halo Infinite é um dos melhores jogos do Xbox, e um dos melhores Fps de historia junto a COD e Doom com certeza, e marcou bastante para quem foi de mente aberta."

Je n'ai malheureusement pas joué aux précédents jeux donc je ne peux pas comparer avec celui-là mais au vu de l'avis général et des vidéos etc que j'ai vu, j'ai l'impression que Halo Infinite est le moins bon d'entre eux que ce soit pour l'histoire, le multijoueur (qui n'a pas reçu l'accueil des joueurs qu'il méritait) et au global.
J'ai passé de nombreuses heures à jouer en solo en multi que ce soit dans les modes spéciaux ou à grind la ranked et j'ai vraiment bien aimé mais j'ai le sentiment qu'il manquait quelque chose qui n'a jamais vu le jour sur Halo infinite et qui ne le verra jamais.
La campagne en monde ouvert est malheureusement décevante avec un plutôt bon début mais on est rapidement confronté au vide du monde ouvert qui nous est offert. Celui-ci se résume à voyager jusqu'à l'emplacement de la quête principale sans réel intérêt à côté. De plus, l'histoire est ok mais du tout incroyable et de ce que j'ai pu regarder, pas à la hauteur des premiers Halo 1, 2 et 3.

SimonExMachina,"Jul 27, 2023",5,"One the most bland and repetitive games I've played in recent memory.

- Presentation is average - some parts look ok (cutscenes, etc.) but the environments are really boring and lack detail. Open world sections look like early Xbox One and the facial animation on characters is laughably bad (new AI „Weapon” especially). Frankly Halo 4 and 5 looked better in a lot of areas.
- Story simply ****. The writing is juvenile and cringy, characters are one-dimensional and not at all interesting. The plot is as simplistic as they come - it's just Chief trying to stop some bad guys who are ""up to no good"". The pacing is completely off, there’s no sense of urgency.
- Gameplay mechanics are actually well done: it feels nice to shoot, move and use all the weapons/gadgets - that's why multiplayer is really fun to play, but unfortunately these good mechanics are wasted in the campaign because...
- ... the mission design and open world structure are both very repetitive, unimaginative and flat out boring after a while. If  You played the first 2h of the game You've pretty much seen all it has to offer. Later on You'll be just doing the exact same things countless times in the same looking environments over and over again. Missions feel like base Destiny 1 and the open world is the same tired stuff we've all seen a million times in Ubiosoft games. Only here the world is completely empty and lifeless.

Despite it's major flaws the game can be enjoyable at times in the campaign and the multiplayer is cool (horrible progression system and lack of content notwithstanding), but overall it's a big disappointment. I just don't think 343 is talented enough to create a truly great Halo game:/"
DeathReis,"Jul 25, 2023",8,"GİRİŞ

2016 yılında Xbox 360 alarak çok doğru bir karar verdiğimi Halo 4'ü oynadığımda anlamıştım, ondan sonrada serüven başladı, 2017 yılında Xbox One S almış ve aldığım ilk 2 oyun Halo 5 ve Halo MCC idi, her Halo oyunu ayrı severim, benim için yerleri ayrıdır(ilk 2 oyun hariç, o oyunlar yaşını çok belli ediyor)

Halo 5'i 2018 yılında bitirdiğimde devam oyunu için aşırı heyecanlanmıştım ve 2021 yılında GELDİ!!!

Oyunu Xbox One S konsolumda oynamak beni mutlu etse de biraz'da hayal kırıklığına uğramıştım, çünkü oyun 30fps idi, FPS'ye çok takmam ancak One S'te oynadığım diğer tüm Halo oyunları 60FPS olduğu için alışmam zaman aldı, alıştığımda ise oynamayı bırakmıştım, çünkü hikayesi bir fiyasko idi.... sonra 4 ay önce aldığım Series X konsolum için grafik testi yapayım derken Halo Infinite'yi bitirmediğimi hatırladım ve ""ne kaybedersin"" dedim ve oynadım, bir kez daha iyi bir karar vermiştim, çünkü oyun ilerledikçe hikayesi oturuyordu ve oynanışta 60FPS'ye çıkışla birlikte harika bir hal almıştı, daha fazla anlatmak yerine incelemeye geçelim

ARTILARI

+One S'te bile güzel gözüken oyun

+Her zamankinden daha iyi olan zırh özellikleri

+Özellikle kanca eklentisi sayesinde çok daha akıcı ve heyecanlı savaşlar

+Kötü başlayan ancak ilerledikçe tatmin edici şekilde rayına oturan hikayesi

+Az ama öz karakterleri

+Fena olmayan Multisi

+Harika ve sayıca yeterli olan boss savaşları

+Çevre tasarımı

+Tatmin eden finali

+Eklenen yeni silahların çoğuyla oynaması aşırı keyifli

EKSİLERİ

-Açık alanlarda oyun nedense çamur gibi gözüküyor, ancak iç mekanlarda özellikle ışıklandırmanın iyi kullanımıyla oyun resmen göz alıyor

-İlk başları önceden de belirttiğim gibi, kötü...

-Ana kötü çok kötü yazılmış

-Son boss rezalet, resmen Halo 1'deki son boss'u kopyalamışlar(o da rezaletti)

SpartanEdge,"Jul 24, 2023",4,"I haven't put a review out on here for some time, but there are some things so maddening about Halo Infinite, i felt compelled to write this review.. and before anyone accuses me of being a Sony Fanboy, i game primarily on Xbox.

As a massive Halo fan ever since the original game on the original Xbox, i was looking forward to this game early on, despite not knowing much about it, and with the promise from 343 that they wouldn't make the mistake of omitting Split screen again after that mistake and backlash in Halo 5, i was looking forward to the release of Infinite, but things happening with this game have all but ruined it for me, hence the very low score.

First, there was the lacklustre graphics in the gameplay reveal, making 343 and Xbox delay the game another year to polish it and keep working on it, which i was all for, and granted, it does look a lot better than then.

The two key things that ruined this game for me however, was revealed before release, and that was that the game was going no release with no only split screen missing, despite their statement that they had learned from their mistakes in this area, but it also would not have Co-Op at all on release out of the box?! This in itself is unforgivable for Halo, especially after a year long delay, and should never have rushed out and released without such fundamental features. This alone had pretty much ruined the excitment i had for this game, and then i was surprised when it got even worse, when i found out just before the game released, when i discovered that the physical version of the game isn't at all what it should be, and that is to say it seems to have pretty much nothing on the disk itself, no PvP or even campaign is installable from the disk?! It has to be installed online and can't be installed from the disk, meaning you do not have a standalone game from the disk itself, and you cannot install the game unless you are online and connected to Xbox live, even if you have the disk!.. To those that download their games, this won't mean anything, but to those who value physical ownership og a game, and the ability to install it without having to rely on online or a service, and want to be able to install it years down the line without internet and service reliance, this is a very big deal indeed, and this is one of the key, if not main reasons people buy their games on physical media.. This will be the first Halo in the entire series that you cannot own physically, and this is a worrying trend if Xbox is willing to treat and release it's flagship series in such a way..

This decision by Xbox/343, has pretty much made buying the game on disk pretty pointless and redundant, with the disk merely being an online activation key, this is not what people buy physical for, and a lot of people are going to be disappointed and angry, and i am one of of them, because i have wasted my money  buying a disk that doesn't even have the game on it?! Sewriously, i may as well have played it on Gamepass and saved my money, and if i knew then what i know now, i would have not bought it, and frankly i feel completely cheated and want a refund for my disk with essentially nothing on it, most of it had to be installed from online when the game released anyway, and wouldn't work without it, don't fall into the trap i did and buy it on disk, because owning it on disk is pointless, for the reasons i explained.

What makes this even more saddening, is that the game actually feels and plays well, but the other things have just ruined the whole thing for me, and yes, while the game does play well, the enviroment in the game is very one tone, or i should say two tone, because there is only two things you will see in this game, the same old grass, rocks, hills and sporadic sprinkling of trees and structures, or the similar looking indoor bits, there is no enviromental diversity throughout the whole game, which gets old quite fast, which wouldn't be so bad if the campaign was particularly interesting,. but it just isn't, it's possibly as weak or even weaker than Halo 5's, and that's saying something...

I always expected this game to play well, it's Halo, in fact the combat feels better than any other game in the series (the driving feels a little off for some reason though), but Halo is about far more than that, it's about it's universe, story, lore and game features such as Co-Op and split-screen, and and its lite on the former and completely absent of the split screen and Co-Op. Yes, they say they are putting Split screen and Co-Op in in half a year or mores, time, but we only have their word on that, and even then, people will have played the game by then, many people wanted to share their first play through with others in Co-Op, and 343 have denied their players this experience. In fact, i am so disappointed and angry with how 343 have shipped this game, i think it's about time Xbox gave Halo to a new develop"
Jhagman,"Jul 23, 2023",9,This game is not perfect but it is very fun to play. The campaign was exceptional as well. The multiplayer system is a little flawed but at its core this game is great.
JoaoAntonioC,"Jul 23, 2023",10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
Thunder183,"Jul 22, 2023",10,It’s a great story mode especially if you enjoyed the previous games especially with the little references they make about the old games games. I recommend playing on legendary to truly get a challenge. The multiplayer is fun but it needs more variety of game modes.
Pollaris,"Jul 12, 2023",9,"Undoubtedly a flawed masterpiece. A mixed quality campaign, the multiplayer takes no risk and the armory isn’t enough. It’s no firefight or warzone."
MasterGubbers,"Jul 11, 2023",8,"The story, new characters, multiplayer maps and gameplay are all amazing, but the open world is just one grassy area and that's it. Besides that, this is the best Halo since Reach and would be even more amazing if 343 was actually not terrible enough to update the game."
WiseAsaf94,"Jul 9, 2023",10,"Me diverti horas com esse novo halo, gráficos lindos, combate incrível e campanha muito divertida."
Lupaslupas,"Jul 9, 2023",9,"I can't comment on the multi player as I never played any halo multi player. For me it was only ever a single player game, and as such my score only reflects that aspect of the game.

First off, I don't understand all the negatives for this game. Sure the graphics are not the best I've seen but they are certainly not the worst. They are perfectly adequate. The gameplay and story is where its at for me and this game delivers in buckets. Sure the semi open world aspect is different and I'm not sure I like that idea as opposed to the standard halo 1 to 3 style of play, but it's OK and offers new play styles. Story was very good, if a little confusing at first, but I do miss the whole cortana and masterchief relationship that was a very big part of the previous halo games, and I hope this game and it's ending shows its heading back that way. I feel what let's down previous titles after halos 1 to 3 and reach, is the story got muddled, confusing, and introduced storylines and enemies people just couldn't gel with and the jump from 5 to infinite seemed disjointed, like how Hollywood attempts a reboot of a series and just kinda ignores what's happened and doesn't flesh out fully how we got here. It feels like it's turned a corner, and attempting to go back to its roots slowly rather than rebooting the entire series. And as much as I love masterchief and cortana I do feel they need a new direction. The problem is, as is the same with other games where we get stuck and attached to a small number of characters, how to make new stories when other characters were only background noise? Odst and reach did a great job with characters other than MC, with stories that made sense and kept to the lore well. It has lost some of its shine that made it so great and mysterious and a joy to explore, and has lost its way in the story but, like I said previously, it does seem to have turned a corner and underlined what's happened previously. I just hope the story can become great again. Infinite is not a perfect game, name one that is perfect, but it does feel and play better than 4 and 5 and the gunplay feels much better and more akin to halo of old. The storyline is good but not perfect, and the ai of the marines is lacking and borderline broken. And one fight in particular felt so confined and rediculously hard due to being trapped and not able to move to avoid being hit, it spoilt it and I contemplated quitting the game and not continuing. I've played and completed every halo game on the hardest setting and never felt cheated when I died. Infinite however, that one confined fight was too hard, and not due to any fault of the players fighting style but due to being to confined and able to killed off two hits and no room to even avoid being hit. That was just lazy gameplay and due to not being tested thoroughly, as no one having played that section could honestly say that was a good idea. But I digress. All in all, as a single player game, it's got a good story, good gunfights, and kept me entertained to the end, and kept me wanting more. Isn't that a sign **** single player game? The only thing I wished for was local Co op, but it was not meant to be. Due in part to that God awful engine of theirs. Hopefully switching to unreal 5 will fix that for the next one. Play the game, you won't be disappointed with the single player."
Harthik69,"Jul 9, 2023",9,Its an EPIC game. I like the gameplay and the visuals were fantastic. I would like to play again in future
CapitanQwark,"Jul 9, 2023",4,A game without soul. Full of mechanics that are not completed and bad physics. The saga has come to an end. Not because the potential of it (Halo is awesome). It's more because Halo Infinite was made with only one intention: Create a Halo-vessel to turn the franchise into a game as service.
DinboNomad2z2,"Jul 5, 2023",6,"Halo 2 and 3 being all time favorite game, this kinda makes me sad. I used to wow at the purple/pinkish sky as I looked out of the  pod after landing in the OG halo. It has vastly improved in terms of quality from initial game play peak, but the rest seems badly tuned/hollow. For gunplay, I think it's being held back by the design of old game play of Halo. No satisfaction from shooting  after playing other modern FPS games as it takes way too long to kill enemies whether it's the pistol or other guns making it feel very hollow. From the initial isolated environment to marines you encounter along the way feels way out of place in terms of expression as they are way too optimistic and happy imo in the condition they're in. Storytelling wasn't bad, but I have nothing to remember this game by as the story did not progressing at all."
Frad,"Jul 4, 2023",8,"Halo Infinite, la última entrega de la aclamada saga de videojuegos, ha generado grandes expectativas entre los fanáticos. En este ensayo, exploraremos en detalle los aspectos positivos y negativos del juego, desde su rendimiento técnico hasta la narrativa y la jugabilidad. A través de una mirada crítica, descubriremos cómo Halo Infinite logra cautivar a los jugadores y, al mismo tiempo, presenta desafíos y deficiencias que afectan su experiencia general.

El apartado técnico de Halo Infinite presenta un rendimiento sólido, aunque no alcanza los anhelados 120 fotogramas por segundo de forma constante. Sin embargo, es importante destacar que la tasa de 60 fps se mantiene en la mayoría de las situaciones, lo que permite una jugabilidad fluida y satisfactoria.

Uno de los aspectos más destacados de este juego es su historia. Desde el comienzo, la trama cautiva al jugador, generando intriga y dejándolo ávido de más. La introducción del personaje de Cortana añade una capa de emoción y familiaridad para los fanáticos de la saga. La narrativa logra transmitir el espíritu que todo seguidor de Halo busca, manteniendo un interés constante a medida que se desarrolla la trama.

El apartado sonoro es otro punto fuerte de Halo Infinite. Los efectos de sonido, como los disparos, las pisadas y las explosiones, están cuidadosamente diseñados, brindando una experiencia auditiva inmersiva que complementa de manera efectiva la acción en pantalla.

Sin embargo, no podemos obviar la presencia de ciertos bugs que afectan la experiencia de juego. Por ejemplo, el problema de las luces parpadeantes, que se presenta con mayor frecuencia en el modo cooperativo, interrumpe la inmersión y puede resultar molesto. Además, el bug en la misión ""The Tower"", que impide abrir una puerta y requiere reiniciar el juego, afecta negativamente el flujo de la narrativa y la progresión del jugador.

En cuanto al diseño de niveles, los campamentos ""FOB"" se destacan por su ubicación estratégica, permitiendo un viaje rápido eficiente por el vasto mundo abierto del juego. Además, los tiempos de carga de pantalla son breves, lo cual es sumamente satisfactorio y evita interrupciones innecesarias en la experiencia de juego.

Los vehículos, aunque un elemento esencial en el universo de Halo, se sienten desafortunadamente inútiles debido al terreno montañoso y poco amigable del juego. Esto provoca que se vuelquen con facilidad o se atoren en obstáculos, lo cual frustra al jugador y limita el disfrute de estas mecánicas clásicas.

La implementación de habilidades en el juego es satisfactoria en general. Sin embargo, el proceso de cambio entre cada una puede resultar tedioso, especialmente cuando se utiliza el D-Pad como un laberinto de selección. Sería más conveniente y fluido tener la opción de mantener presionado RB y, luego, utilizar el D-Pad para seleccionar directamente la habilidad deseada.

Además, se han identificado varios bugs que afectan la progresión del jugador, como el bug en la misión de destruir los antiaéreos, donde es necesario reiniciar el juego para completarla correctamente. Estos problemas interrumpen el flujo de la experiencia y generan frustración innecesaria.

La música ambiental del juego merece un reconocimiento especial. La banda sonora logra capturar a la perfección la esencia y el ambiente del mundo de Halo, brindando una experiencia auditiva envolvente que añade profundidad emocional a la jugabilidad.

El diseño del menú de habilidades y mejoras está bien implementado, proporcionando una presentación armoniosa y fácil de comprender. No resulta abrumador, pero tampoco se siente escaso, lo cual es un equilibrio importante en juegos de esta magnitud.

En general, Halo Infinite ofrece una experiencia de juego satisfactoria, con una historia envolvente y un rendimiento técnico sólido. El modo campaña cumple con las expectativas de los fans de la saga, y el mundo abierto, a pesar de carecer de variedad de biomas, no desmerece la experiencia en general. Sin embargo, se siente repetitivo en su diseño, lo que afecta la sensación de exploración y diversidad.

El modo multijugador, por otro lado, cumple con las expectativas de un juego de Halo, ofreciendo diferentes modos de juego y la posibilidad de jugar con amigos. Además, su rendimiento técnico es excelente.

En conclusión, Halo Infinite logra cautivar a los jugadores con su narrativa envolvente y su apartado sonoro impecable. Aunque presenta ciertos desafíos técnicos y decisiones de diseño cuestionables, la experiencia general es satisfactoria para los seguidores de la saga. Halo Infinite nos sumerge una vez más en el universo de los anillos y nos brinda un emotivo cierre con el tema de Cortana, dejando a los verdaderos fanáticos de Halo satisfechos."
Haziel-020,"Jul 1, 2023",10,"Al fin pude pasarme Halo Infinite y sin duda es uno de los mejores Halo qué e jugado y lo que me encanta de Halo infinite es su jugabilidad y historia, y si yo se que en mundo abierto no es de lo mejor pero todos los easter eggs y bases enemigas que tiene el mundo abierto hace que Halo Infinite tenga más re jugabilidad"

Filling up a Mongoose and driving 6 rocket launcher marines into covenant infested areas is one of the most fun times I've ever had with a video game without question. If you've ever played a Halo game before and enjoyed it you NEED to play this one as it does everything the older ones do but better and adds a grappling hook on top.

Bountyhuntre,"Jun 6, 2023",0,"It took far too long for Halo Infinite to get to its current state, but now it is a great addition to the franchise. The criticism towards the story is it all feels redundant and makes a waste of the last two entries in regard to the Forerunner set up. There are far too few conclusions to story threads started in Halo 4 and Halo 5. Despite this, the open world and gameplay make the campaign worth playing.
In multiplayer is where Infinite currently shines. The gameplay feels tight and responsive, the weapon variety is satisfactory, and there are nos numerous playlists to switch between. As a ""live service"" game, 343 failed miserably. Yet as with the Halo MCC, over time Infinite has become a game worth your time."

Aaaand it's another barebones and lackluster update - game is dead

Problems that need fix before recommendation:
-commendation system
-proper mythic ranks (banish themed??) & acual relevant rewards tied to progression
-custom game stability
-theater stability,
-desync
-firefight
-proper anti cheat

UnexpectedQuaza,"May 31, 2023",7,After investing my time to go through all the games before this game released I have to say I am somewhat disappointed. The environments are very bland and honestly terrible for a series x game which looks worse than alot of last gen games. The story also shows that xbox still struggles to get close to what playstation provides. The one saving grace is the gameplay. Using the hooking to traverse the environment is phenomenal and the abilities you get improve the way you play at a constant pace throughout the story. In the end i think this is the most 7/10 game i have ever played.
I_PlayGames,"May 29, 2023",6,"I played this for a while as my introduction into Halo, However, after playing some of the older titles notably Halo 3 I noticed that Halo infinite is just inferior to some of the older Halos."
Patoplexx,"May 24, 2023",8,"Muy buen juego, la mejor campaña de todas a mi gusto, a nivel técnico le falta, el mundo abierto no termina de cerrar, el online tampoco Esperemos mejore en el futuro"
Hulsee,"May 22, 2023",8,"In the next installment of Master Chiefs journey across the galaxy, as you hit ground on Zeta **** just feels different.  343 industries has hit the jackpot on this one.

From an absolutely compelling story centered on strategy and longevity, if you can show restrain from running through the campaign you will be rewarded with side missions, and other activities that are each unique and story compelling.  As you navigate the newest ring, you'll find that gameplay is overall smooth(I even had it on my turd of a console -A day one Xbox One X- rather than a Series X) and with the fresh new set of abilities for Chief to master.  You'll find these new gadgets suited to assist you in synergy with the others constantly throughout the campaign.

The addition of mini-bosses, and end of level bosses adds a personal touch to each segment of the game as you feel rewarded for persevering through to exhaust the seemingly infinite foe in front of you. Adding further to the each new game will be unique aspect, as you climb further up the difficulty list that end mission boss fight feels that much sweeter after ripping through hordes of mixed and intelligent enemies.

And for the enemies themselves the new and returning enemies we have come to know have been kicked up q notch with voice acting for each and every type of enemy and ally in the game. Creating scenario specific dialog you may not get without a little creativity, further adding to its campaign replayablitiy.

The finest Halo i have personally seen since I overused my poor Halo Reach copy so many years ago.  With faith restored in 343 to make a great and compelling game I look forward to years of advancement on Halo Infinite and its inevitable and expected sequel.  Strap in Spartans this one will live on for a while."
qBoris,"May 19, 2023",7,Gameplay is really good. You kill the enemies very different in the open world. Sandbox part is really powerful. but in story mode most of the time you are seeing metal corridors and halls. You are seeing same kind of missions back to back.

Wrath_over,"May 9, 2023",6,"Halo's legacy is long and storied. Some of the highest highs in the industry, it has yet to hit a truly disastrous low yet, but i's best years are sadly behind it.

Halo infinite isn't as bad game, its just a underwhelming one. The ball was in 343's park, despite the less then favorable reveal years ago, but with a deal to polish up, F2p multiplayer, and a new campaign things looked good, and where even great with the MP BETA. Good overall game feel and the bones of what made old halo Great.

It sadly was missing some key ingredients to make a player feel full. A large number of issues have been resolved, but the bitter taste of disappointment lingers and  makes returning to  this course hard to swallow."

At first before it came out 343 they sold us the idea that the king is back the story will draw back the fans and the multiplayer will be everything we loved about the classic Halo games and so much more. And what dis we get? A boot to the face that's what we got. Everything was a lie. The game is so laggy empty and void of anything fun and creative. The campaign is so boring and short, it's so forgettable and the multiplayer oh don't get me started with that hot garbage . If you know you know. Just go to YouTube and you will have ppl perfectly explane the whole dumpster fire of a multiplayer this game has. Please fire 343 studios and just let Halo die. Let it rest, just stop"

The gameplay is beyond incredible, extremely comfortable and intuitive, with a great multiplayer and great gameplay segments in the campaign. It's also visually stunning, but I only have a few issues with the campaign. There aren't many huge interesting cutscenes except in the beginning of the game and the story could be kinda weird for people just about to get into halo. There also aren't many new settings in the game except 3. Great gameplay experience, but it's clear that it's rough in the edges (and maybe the budget and time)"

kevoc1115,"Apr 14, 2023",3,"Halo Infinite is the most Limited Release of it's Franchise.

This game has so much potential, so many good ingredients, however it is put together so horribly. Feels like the frontline hardworking developers tried their best but the upper management screwed it all up with bad priorities.

The core gameplay is solid which makes it fun for 3 weeks before it goes stale. But the game is shallow. There's no progression, no rewards or career ranks, the weekly challenges are not fun, seems like challenges are purposely made bad so they can sell their ""challenge swaps"" (one of the lamest creations in video game history), there's limited ability to build a spartan, the already limited armor pieces are split amongst separate cores, there's limited flexibility in choosing what game modes to play; all wrapped up with daily and exhausting reminders to ""swing by the shop"" and by some overpriced armor piece or coloring that's only good for 1 particular ""Amor core.""

Ultimately, there is nothing to play for. The catastrophic failure to prioritize a fulfilling progression system has turned Halo, a once thriving community, into a desolate wasteland. If priorities were shifted there would be more of a population playing this game, thus leading to more store activity. However, the priorities were backwards. Issued a shallow game and now the fans/remaining gamers are being pounded by relentless/exhausting micro transactions. The F2P model was a major step backwards for this franchise."
Robert88,"Apr 5, 2023",9,"A solid halo experience  story wise but  I can care less about the  multiplayer , reason why I gave this a 9/10 is because,  it seems 343 cared more about delivering a multiplayer game over a story driven one .. infinite is riddled with advertisements , and micro transactions .selling skins and all this other nonsense ..  the game play in the story is pretty awesome and fast pace ,  new weapons skins and enemy ai is pretty tough , and react to things you’re doing , predicting your movements , some boss fights on legendary can get a pain in the rear end ,  with corn ball tactics and precise attacks  which make it difficult but entertaining to play .. I feel the  world though is a bit empty , should’ve been more enemies , more things to do, 343i should have given the players a reason to want to explore the world , find rare weapons and alow us to add it to our inventory hidden boss battles , rare exclusive weapons that we can keep , not just use and discard .  Added more diversity to the world and a lot more objectives and sort lines , more characters... perhaps some side quest where and consequences to your actions failing to rescue some on of a fob , or prisoners ..  branching story . I feel there is absolutely no consequences to rescuing prisoners and them dying a few seconds later ..  the story is interesting , but it’s lacking a lot . Boss battles are tough and engaging , some random bosses  can be pretty tough as well .. abilities you can unlock are great though  wishing it was a bit easier to swap them instead  of having to press a button look at what abilities is what button and press that one .. it’s a bit of a pain to do when you have like 20-30 enemies circling you .

Overall I love the game even with minor grips I would have it a ten , the multiplayer focused and Microsoft money hungry tactics take a point or two down ..  still though what an amazing halo game for a first attempt . Fix a few quicks , cut out the multiplayer bull crap , add a lot more exploration and other things in story ,  add some real detail side quest  you’ll have a game of the year"
Teccer,"Apr 4, 2023",10,"good graphics, good and varied enemies, cool boss battles with a wonderful open world and really good story with good weapons. My favorite Xbox game ever!"
ZackH25,"Apr 1, 2023",7,"So in terms of core gameplay the multiplayer and Campaign are at least 8/9 out of 10. The campaign has a lot of fun guns and items to use, and those items make the campaign a great sandbox campaign. The Grappelshot is an excellent addition to halo and makes gameplay a lot better. The gunplay is very good and a lot better than halo 4 or 5. However the story in the campaign is mediocre at best and the villain is very bland- I don't know why they didn't have Atriox as the main villain. Also the open world.    was nice at first but it is all essentially the same environment so there is almost no variety. There is a bit of enemy variety. Multiplayer has good gameplay but barely any content, which is very frustrating. Overall a good foundation but not much to it."
Skeleton-Rave,"Mar 31, 2023",0,"Halo infinite's multiplayer experience feels like a slap in the face to lifelong fans and newcomers alike. The introduction of the armor core system was perhaps the most poorly thought-out idea in the history of video games. Now, 343 still refuses to implement cross-core customization even though thousands of fans have asked them to do so. This on its own would not be too bad if it weren't for the fact that store items cost upwards of $20+! One item in particular is just a color coating that can be applied cross-core. This item costs $15!!!! Just for a camo skin! 343 doesn't care about its fans and is almost criminally incompetent at handling any issue with the game that arises. DO NOT BUY."

Kio22,"Mar 26, 2023",5,"Empty, unfinished game with terrible pacing between the open world parts and the linear missions. This combined with terrible characters and a nonsensical incomplete story would make it a bad game if it didn't have one redeeming quality. This one redeeming quality is the gun play and upgrades given to the player which make the game fun for a little bit until you realize how repetitive all the side quests, main story missions, and boss fights are. Overall it is a mediocre game slightly better than Halo 5 only due to the fun gun-play and the interesting but empty open world section."

Pro_Ponder,"Mar 14, 2023",9,"The doomsday clock has been ticking on this game but things were slowly starting to look brighter over the last 6 months and now starting season 3 we are really starting to burn the fuse and this game is getting ready to explode onto everyone’s hard drive as season 3 is a blast, fantastic new maps, good new weapons and equipment and some highly underrated new cores along with what now finally feels like a live service with a story that has now begun and has people guessing as to what’s coming next, a shift of staff at 343 had people worried but if this new team keeps it up then we are in for a good future for halo, halo clean combat is not only fun and engaging it is a test of accuracy and mind as each battle feels like a chess match at times. Becoming better at halo and learning how to play the game better is much more rewarding than your other FPS games, if you have put halo down in the last year then now is the time to return and dip your toe again."
Jotnar,"Mar 9, 2023",0,"Mise à part les graphismes des textures, il est 100 fois moins bien détaillé que Halo 3 et Reach:
Les explosions sont immondes, la physique est mauvaise, les balles ne ricochent plus.
Les cartes sont mauvaises, la progression ne se fait QUE par BattlePass car ils ont supprimer le système de crédit. Les grades ont disparut !!!!!
Il manque un nombre incroyable d'armes et les indicateur dynamique sur les armes ont disparu.
Un jeu pour faire uniquement de l'argent et moins soigné que celui sorti il y a plus de 10 ans !!!!

funyunknight,"Mar 5, 2023",9,At this point I’d say this game is super underrated. I loved the campaign personally and enjoyed the change of pace open world. For me the combat is the best it’s been in a decade and my favorite FPS game of this last generation because it feels so good to play. The grappling hook is incredible and my favorite thing Halo has added since the abilities in Reach. The multiplayer lacking content is inexcusable but the content it does have is top notch. I have no problems with the battle pass/micro transactions because I really don’t care about cosmetic only items costing money. As long as it doesn’t create an unfair advantage mechanics wise I’m fine with them. It’s a shame this game gets trashed now but I think if you like FPS games you owe it to yourself to at least try it out. Excited for the future of the franchise and I’m curious where they will go with it from here. Hope it doesn’t go the way of “Fable” and that we don’t have to wait forever for the next game.
rokkogirda,"Mar 5, 2023",0,"This game lives up to the hype.

Well implemented cinematic storytelling, music and nostalgia, progression system, navigation and exploring, bosses, side activities, lore expansion and database, new weapons. I had zero technical issues. Everything about the campaign feels just right! Can't say much about competetive multiplayer experience since I only play quick matches casually and they're plenty fun too. Easily the best Halo game for me."
SelfPlayer123,"Feb 23, 2023",8,"Tbh I get why this game is so heavily disliked, but that doesn't mean I agree. Halo 5:Guardians was a collosal failure, as that game ruined Halo's entire appeal, but this game restored my faith in 343, however it's flaws run deep. If you are looking for a good story then this is the game. If you want a good Multiplayer with live service that isn't repetitive than look somewhere else. I think the multiplayer is the true flaw here and is the only thing that keeps this game from being a very good Halo."

* Server problems.
* Small player population.
* Lacklustre shop.

If you want to play an FPS that feels like the polished and basic games of old then Halo Infinite is perfect. However, you will be dealing with a few issues."

woohoosims,"Feb 1, 2023",9,"I wanted to give this a 10 so bad, because Halo… but I can’t. For me personally, the main story is great but the world it’s set in becomes a little bland and graphically I don’t find it to be a true representation of Next Gen.

With that aside, it is a lot of fun and combat is insanely satisfying which is the main thing. Multiplayer is also tonnes of fun too despite slow updates. Hopefully with the reshuffling at 343 we can start to see more regular updates and content."
Exlee3000,"Jan 31, 2023",0,Disappointing!  Was expecting it to much better given the long development cycle.  I think it's time for 343 to pass Halo to a new developer.  They have had three tries and have struck out.

The campaign is a lot of fun, and the multiplayer is a return to classic Halo. The lack of content, however, is the major drawback here. The campaign is similar to Halo 2 in that it doesn’t really ‘end.’ Instead, it’s more of a stop. There also aren’t a lot of multiplayer maps. Playing on the same maps can get quite repetitive real quick. While I truly love this game, there just needs to be more content."

It perfectly takes the Halo design to a fun and engaging open world, though the story was a bit confusing. And the gameplay of the multiplayer is excellent and a perfect blend of old-school Halo and new mechanics. Of course the game's main issue is 343's super slow pace of updating. The seasons have been way too long, though it seems like they'll be fixing this for 2023 so I wouldn't worry too much about it. A must play for shooter fans."

mikeinashed,"Dec 16, 2022",7,"The core gameplay is there - it's still Halo, after all. And it feels great to play. The multi-player is also a blast.
But there's a lot missing. The campaign feels like a cut version - there's one biome and the missions that take place in ships/structures all feel the same, with illogical corridor layouts just to provide some space between rooms. I'm not at all sure that the open world structure works better than some bespoke environments with clear mission goals.
In multiplayer, there's none of the cool game modes that Halo 5 launched with (or later added). No warzone, no firefight, nothing. Just 4v4 and big team battle (which is great fun, in fairness).
Basically, it's Halo - it's a good game. But it also feels like a missed opportunity."

KanchalYT,"Dec 14, 2022",7,"This is a breath of fresh air for Halo fans. 343 have managed to turn the story around after the complete dumpster fire of Halo 5 and I feel that this story is great in terms of twists, mystery, and just general lore being tossed around. Collecting all of the collectibles is fun and most of them have their own lore too. The way the guns interact in the sandbox is the best in the series in my opinion. Sprint has been nailed down perfectly, and previously bad weapons now have a definitive role in the gameplay. The music is major a nostalgia trip, reminding me of previous halo games but being unique enough to be able to differentiate between the soundtracks from previous games. Points were docked due to the abysmal post launch support for the multiplayer. Players were drip fed content, and that content was spaced out every 4-6 months with special events sprinkled throughout. The micro-transactions are the worst thing to have happened to this game as 343 has to pump out cosmetics to keep the store page new and fresh (they’ve spectacularly failed at this). They’ve demonstrated their inability to run a “live” service game and it shows."

Ianlov,"Nov 17, 2022",5,"I honestly don't understand how so many people rave about this game?

I was a pure halo head up until reach and since then 343 always seem to miss what halo actually is.

Upon loading up halo infinite I was extremely impressed. It actually felt like a halo game on first play.

After a few hours the issue's really started to show through.

Pretty much all customisation is locked behind a paywall even colours of Spartan armour. What's even worse is some weapon skins etc are timed so you don't even own them.

Secondly I actually found going around the map extremely tedious and ammo was always an issue for me.

The main story is extremely short considering it's pretty much open world exploration.

Now let's discuss the online eek.

As said I was a pure halo head from halo 2 introducing online right through to reach I lived online in halo (once completed the campaign on legendary).

One thing I loved about halo was the online competitive matches and many options of what to play whether team slayer, snipers, swat, objective or even big team battles kept me hooked for years.

Since 343 took over I've not been able to get into it so imagine how even more disappointed I was playing through game and feeling like halo again only to realise there's no online content.

Ranked playlists are limited to one playlist and it's got everything thrown in so what happens is you get stuck in an objective game where people only want kid and don't care about the objective because all they're interested in is slayer.

There's also game breaking issues called server desynching. All online games have a level of this however halo infinite is horrendous. So bad in fact that they tried to fix and made it even worse and then publicly came out saying they couldn't fix it.

It's so bad that every other game it felt like major lag where you're running for cover and hide behind it only to die through the cover simply because the server hadn't updated for them. As far as their screen concerned you're standing out in the open. Or you're shooting someone and half your bullets aren't registering so you're shooting someone in the back a few times they turn round and outshoot you even though you put enough ammo into their back to kill multiple enemies.

I totally understand there not being much to play on the series X so for many people any game is a good game but coming from being hyped every time I put halo on even after 1000's of hours of play to uninstalling the game after a week of trying is too much to ignore."

cchenders40,"Nov 14, 2022",9,"This is a really great game and the only reason it’s not a 10/10 are personal reasons and the current state of the multiplayer. CAMPAIGN
The campaign is very amazing, has subtle performances, a great villain, and some good twists and turns. Chief and Weapon specifically shine in the story. The map is wonderful, there is so much to do, the sandbox elements are very very fun as well. There are also a ton of fun collectibles to find if you’re into that! This game also has fun boss battles!
My problem with the campaign comes from the fact that I love halo 3 as an ending to Chiefs story. I think Halo 4 and Infinite are incredible games, but I just wish it was with a different spartan and that chiefs story closed with 3. As I said that’s a personal reason, I just think H3 id a perfect ending to Chiefs story and every new game moves further from that. I’d love it if this current trilogy told the story of a new Spartan and partner AI. Not a real critique just how I wish the story went.

MULTIPLAYER The gameplay is 10/10. It is top tier as far as the shooting and movement go. There is just not a lot of content and the battle pass is just plain bad. I have 1000s of hours into H2, Halo Reach, Halo 4, and Halo 5 multiplayer, but I fell off this games multiplayer after a few weeks. Too few maps, the cosmetics are hard to come by, the battle pass and reward system is poorly designed. This could be fixed with an update and some free DLC but right now it’s just not fun. If it had more content and a better battle pass I could easily sink 100s of hours into this game. If you have game pass definitely download it and play it. I’d say it’s worth buying if you don’t have game pass. If you’ve never played a halo though skip it. The story is confusing to new players and very lore heavy.

Edit in Late 2022: The support for this game has increasingly gotten better, it feels like a complete game now and the multiplayer with forge is awesome. Love this game!"

Split screen got cancelled after being PROMISED. My first ever experience to Halo was splitscreen and played in split screen every single one of them that had it and still have friends come over for some split screen fun with Halo MCC from time to time. This is not Halo. 343 killed the franchise.

The sound and music were good, but nothing that stood out for me.

The story hit the mark for me, mysterious and emotional. It kept me hooked until the end.

The game-play was so much fun, even though a grappling hook is nothing revolutionary, it was implemented right and it made the game a blast.

Not a big multiplayer guy, so you may take this with a grain of salt, but I did play for about 10 hours and I did have fun, but I hated a few maps (especially the desert one), and the good ones got boring pretty quick since there were not many in total."

Techniquement c'est vraiment propre, optimisation au top. On aurait aimé quand même un peu plus de vie dans le jeu, de détail, on sent que le développement a été orienté pour que le jeu tourne sur toutes les anciennes consoles Xbox. Du coup sur PC ou Series X, c'est pas LA claque, mais en 2021 avoir un jeu avec quasiment zéro bug le jour J c'est devenu rare. L'IA typique de Halo est bien là, c'est toujours aussi marrant de se battre et leur réaction est un cran au dessus de tout ce qui se fait en FPS.

Pontos positivos:
+ Controles: Jogabilidade muito fluída, quer você jogue no controle ou no teclado/mouse;
+ Localização: Para quem gosta de jogar em PT-BR, ficou muito bem feito, sem os erros de tradução do Halo 4.
+ Continuidade da trama: Apesar de tentarem dar uma boa ignorada no Halo 5, conseguiram fazer de um jeito que não elimina o principal evento do jogo anterior.
+ Batalhas contra Chefes: Força você a procurar alternativas sobre como combater cada um. Na dificuldade mais difícil então. É de xingar, mas quando vence dá uma satisfação incrível.
+ Multiplayer incrível, equilibrado e divertido... e grátis.
Pontos negativos:
+ História rasa: Basicamente, é isso que o povo pediu, você mata ET's porque eles são maus. ET's fazem discurso pra mostrar que são muito maus e por isso você vai matar eles. Tem uma trama mais pessoal no meio, que eu gostei e achei que deveria ser a principal, mas ela foi meio deixada como segundo plano.
+ Mundo aberto, com checklist de mundo aberto: torres de radio para destruir, lista de alvos secundários para matar, itens para coletar.
+ Faltou o anticheat no multiplayer."

Puedes tener mejores armas y mejores acmpañantes conforme haces misiones secundarias. Las peleas de jefes son increhibles y las cinematicas de lo mejor en Series X  que es en donde lo jugue..

helorisk,"Jul 24, 2022",9,"Entre os últimos jogos lançados pela 343, esse é o melhor. Porém, não é possível dizer que seja o melhor da saga, mas um dos melhores. As mecânicas finalmente foram balanceadas entre o old school e o new School, o speed possui a dose certa, e o gancho foi um dos melhores equipamentos inseridos na gameplay. A história é de longe a melhor de Halo nos últimos anos, sem falar na substituta de Cortana, que caiu como uma luva. O enredo possui um forte valor sentimental, e um apelo emocional excelente, finalmente me senti jogando um Halo digno de uma saga fabulosa. Foi inserido vida ao ambiente, algo quase que ausente nos dois últimos Halos, e o mundo semi aberto foi muito bem vindo. Com bastante coisas para fazer e pontos para conquistar, entretanto, as missões se tornam repetitivas. De pontos negativos, pode ser citado justamente o ambiente, apesar de nesse game existe vida no cenário, ainda assim é muito pequeno comparado a outros jogos de mesma grandiosidade. Mais um aspecto negativo é a expressão facial dos inimigos, dos Brutes, é bastante limitada, com aparência pobre, isso se compararmos a outros jogos da franquia. A respeito do gráfico, é um excelente gráfico para a geração passada, mas ainda sim inferior ao de Halo 5 Guardians. No mais, Halo Infinite é um excelente jogo para a franquia Halo, trouxe momentos nostálgicos como outrora nos causava. Mas ficou devendo em termos gráficos e um maior capricho na aparência dos inimigos, na vida do mundo semi aberto, e maior variedade de missões secundárias."

The gameplay is genuinely solid, and that is all I can praise about this game. But even that is flawed, ruined by the terrible matchmaking system and the various issues surrounding multiplayer at this point in time. I haven't played Infinite in over 7 months, and I don't think I will be returning any time soon."
zezeljmare,"Jul 11, 2022",7,"EN:
The campaign is much better and more interesting than the HALO 5 campaign, unfortunately the MP content is missing a lot, even though the game came out more than half a year ago. Weak selection of weapons, lack of a CO-OP campaign... Certain parts of the campaign are extremely complicated, sometimes frustrating, primarily due to the poor design of the checkpoint system.

SRB:
Kampanja je poprilično bolja i interesantnija od HALO 5 kampanje, nažalost MP sadržaj nedostaje u velikoj meri, iako je igra izašla pre više od pola godine. Slab izbor oružija, nedostatak CO-OP kampanje... Pojedine deonice u kampanji su izuzetno komplikovane, na momente i frustrirajuće, pre svega zbog lošeg dizajna checkpoint sistema."
Gamerberg,"Jul 10, 2022",6,"The campaign was ok. Story was decent and a large improvement from halo 5. I’m not a huge fan of the whole open world though and the world itself is lacking variety and the gameplay becomes redundant. It would have been great to have different environments because now everything looks the same. Also it is a bit forgetable, It dosent have all the memorable moments like the oider titles had.

Multiplayer have some game breaking issues that most likely will never get any fixes. In its core the multiplayer is great and a lot of fun which makes it so sad that they don’t fix the issues. The main issues are:

-	DESYNC – Largest problem in the multiplayer. Getting shot behind walls, shots not registering, beatdown from behind not killing, beatdown not from behind killing, grenades not causing damage and so on. Will probably never gets fixed. The old Halo titles (1, 2, 3, reach) plays much better and they never had these problems.
-	No region filters. In halo mcc you can set that you only want to play on for example European servers. This is not possible in Infinite which means that you, when playing in Europe, will get thrown into North American servers sometimes (especially occurring when playing late in central European time). North American servers are unplayable to play on for Europeans due to that the ping is 140-200 ms.
-	Big team is not very fun anymore. Largest problem are the maps which are designed like Formel 1 tracks which causes ground vehicles to become useless due to that there is only one route to take which makes them easy to destroy. Also, they are cluttered with obstacles on the drive paths. What happened to the big and open maps that we all loved from the older titles? Adding all the 1 million anti vehicles equipment’s doesn’t make it any better (especially the ridiculous electric grenade or dynamo or whatever it’s called).
-	Still no co-op, forge, custom browser, theater is broken and barely usable.
-	They didn’t add any player collision which is so stupid. Nobody asked for this to be removed."

I just played the Campaign in June of 2022. I always play on Heroic mode and I LOVED IT. The campaign forced me to learn and use all the suit upgrades as it progressed. This game was actually a tad harder than other Halo games in a good way. The bosses felt real and satisfying to beat.

CONS:
I do miss co-op and hope they add it soon. Cortana's dialogue got stale in the middle section of the game during some of the open world sections (Thanks to you, Spartan! over and over)."
KingAwesome,"Jul 3, 2022",8,"Halo Infinite is a true revival of the classic series. The campaign, which mixes together classic Halo gunplay with a brand new open world, is the best the series has seen since the Xbox 360 era. The graphics and music are on point, despite this game looking like literal poop when it was first revealed. The multiplayer, however, is more of a mixed bag. The multiplayer itself is very fun and fluid, but the main issue I take with the multiplayer is some of the missing series staples that are missing at this current point. Campaign co-op and forge are nowhere to be found, which is extremely disappointing. My last issue I take with the game is the F2P elements, such as expensive microtransactions, and a lame battle pass. Overall, 343 Industries has made the first great Halo game since Bungie left the series, and hopefully can carry on this innovation into the next installment in the series."

My face was difficult at times, but I wanted it that way and I always have to play Legendary on Halo. First of all, I liked the game and the Master Chief got a worthy game.

story

Everything about the Master Chief, the Halo Ring and Cortana has always been fascinating. I really enjoyed the staging and story of the campaign and the whole thing was decorated with the great sci-fi trappings of the Halo universe. I liked all the characters that were introduced, only ""the antagonist"" was a bit flat. But I especially liked the pilot and the weapon in the interaction with the Master Chief. The chief himself was also more involved and sympathized with him. I'm excited to see how it goes from there.

gameplay

In terms of shooter technology, the thing runs buttery smooth again. Testing the different weapons and gadgets was a lot of fun and I really grew to love some of the weapons along the way. The many grenade options also give the player enough oomph. I also found the rather critically viewed open world to be integrated quite nicely and the activities have, even if you e.g. Knowing how to conquer bases, the gameplay made it a lot of fun. Especially the bounties were always a nice change. In addition, the interlocking of Open World and classic Halo tube levels worked well. The classic level designs can be found here very often.

The new approach to bosses was also courageous, but I have to say that some fights quickly become boring, especially on Legendary. Boss has a shield eventually switches to melee and can onehit you. You then basically run in circles with the grappling hook the whole time and do a little enemy damage. That got tiring and frustrating at some point, even if I have to write the level of difficulty myself, of course. The gameplay design of the bosses could have been more innovative and e.g. to enable more interaction with the environment.

Graphics/atmosphere/presentation

Yes, graphically, there is a lot more. Unfortunately, the open world in particular, as well as it was integrated into the game for me, didn't look good enough. I was hoping for a variety of biomes, lush flora and fauna and unfortunately got little to none of it. Everything looked relatively dreary, even if there were always very nice areas in the open world. On the other hand, the indoor levels warmed my sci-fi heart. It all looked beautiful and just oozed atmosphere. Couple that with the wonderful music and you're in Halo heaven.

The cutscenes were also consistently well staged. Some of the facial expressions were pretty weak though, especially Escharum just looked bad in some scenes, but the weapon sometimes had strange facial expressions as well.

Conclusion

I wanted the chief, I got the chief. There is definitely wasted potential there, but that can be made better in the next parts. The open world approach in particular must then be filled out better as far as the presentation is concerned. A little more diversity in boss fights, and a little more gadget relevance (the grappling hook consistently steals the show on Legendary). Total 8/10 halo rings. (4/5)"
TheBG72,"Jul 2, 2022",7,I have put a decent amount of time into this game and overall I'd say it's quite good. But the lack of game modes and maps in the multiplayer means that you can get burnt out quite quickly with it. However the core gameplay is good enough to entertain for quite a few hours or even days
Rai-N,"Jun 29, 2022",9,"The guns feel much better than the fourth and fifth, and the visuals look great. Gameplay feels like Halo with some new add-ons. the story has improved from the past 2 games with new characters like The Weapon and Echo-216. I've had a ton of fun with the multiplayer and it's different game modes. One thing that I don't like about the game is the cosmetics. Most helmets, colors, and other cosmetics are blocked by a paywall. You can get some stuff from events and the battle-pass, but I would rather be able to level up and gain cosmetics that way."
waywardlaser,"Jun 28, 2022",7,"The story may be nothing to write home about and the objectives can feel fairly repetitive, but it almost doesn't matter because this is undoubtedly the best Halo has ever played. Easily the strongest entry since Reach, even if 343 still isn't living up to the franchise's full potential. But it's the closest they've gotten to Bungie's greatness. Even though the plot is barebones, Master Chief himself might be the most interesting portrayal we've seen of the character to date. Dare I say...I enjoyed this more than Reach and it might be my favourite entry since 3?

Can't really speak for the online mode. I played a few games and it feels solid, but I generally can't stand modern progression systems. So this rating is just for the campaign. Maybe I wouldn't be as kind if I had paid full price for it, but as a jumping-off point into Game Pass on my shiny new Series X this was well-worth my time. Barely any downtime spent on loading screens and a smooth, consistent 60 fps? Simply wonderful."
HaloVeteran,"Jun 28, 2022",0,Another amazing Halo game by one of the most talented development studios in the video game industry.
flighty_plus,"Jun 22, 2022",4,The story of the game is not as good as its previous versions and the multiplayer part becomes very boring after a while
DerBexucher1,"Jun 22, 2022",5,"The Story was mediocre at best. When you are an old school Halo Veteran than it was a slap to the face. The events between Halo 5/Halo Wars 2 and Infinite don't get explained deeply and the Story itself is not really appealing either.

Then Open World Aspect is one of the most useless design decisions to date and just lengthens the game play time with traveling.

The Multiplayer is catastrophic. One of the worst netcodes to date"
Andon,"Jun 21, 2022",3,"""Hm... this door requires power seed. Let's look around!""

1st halo game and i can say that this game is simply not fun. pvp is no different than any other (can be fun with friends), campaign is boring, same mission over and over on a different place that looks exactly the same as the last one, same 'open' world 'tasks', progression is non existent, the guy dies in two water pistol shots, his ammo runs out faster than my weekly salary, story is predictable. same enemies, same tactics, over and over and over. i dont understand what made halo so popular at all.
the game at least looks good. no crashing or any bugs that i could notice."
BaldingSpider76,"Jun 14, 2022",9,"A good variation to the series of halo to make the game an open world, but manteining the importance of the mission. The combat system is really good with some improvements and new things that can be used. The story isn't unforgettable like the other halos but i think its not bad."

La campaña es algo sumamente emocionante, cargada de tramas y subtramas acompañadas de una narrativa casi perfecta.

User11234,"May 21, 2022",7,"It's litteraly the exact game since halo combat evolved except some graphical upgrades and some upgrades to the online stability, they're probably becoming the next ea soon. Stay away unless you're a die hard halo game. The reason im giving it at least a 2 is because it at least preforms well, and the graphics are nice. but i were bored throughout the whole game, it's also a real shame because i really wanted to enjoy this game since this is on pc for free, but i guess this wasn't for me. im willing to give this game one more chance and if i do enjoy it then, i will change to an 7.
edit: have spent some time with it and when i understood it it's actually not a bad game. I were really harsh on this game so changing the score to 7"
Sunykamey,"May 20, 2022",4,"Halo Infinite is the best game of 343 but still a bad Halo Game. No social features, no forge, run-in-the-mill-campaign and everything else decent but not great. I don't think that they should be praised for mediocrity. Well at least for me this was the last time they lied to us, see what they promised with season passes and FTP multiplayer but not deliveries on many fronts even half year in. This is enough for me.

UPDATE: Even a half year in we still have a lot of core features missing (e.g., coop, various costums and game-modes, forge, social features etc.) and only empty promises. 343 is unfit to handle the mantle. And lying is the worst offence they have done so far, lying about content, lying about deadlines, lying about communications. That's how you bury a legend"
LoneWolf912s,"May 19, 2022",9,"EL REY HA VUELTO!
Halo infinite  tiene una historia muy buena llena de muchos misterios como en halo ce

Thejodjeremie,"May 13, 2022",7,I finished the campaign and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it's my favorite campaign out of the halo games but it was still fun to play. The open world was a fun edition even though the side content is very basic for open world games.
B-Bog,"May 13, 2022",7,"The combat is the best it's ever been in the 343 days and very fun and fluid, especially with the addition of the grappling hook. Although the devs didn't really seem to grasp its importance, making it share the same button with a bunch of inconsequential gimmicks you'll never need.

The story, though, is once again a complete and utter mess. Everything interesting happens off screen and before the game even starts, and all of Halo Infinite is just you, running around, trying to piece together what even led up to you being on Zeta Halo in the first place. It's such a weird and disjointed approach to story-telling that really makes you think that they came up with the Open World first and then just jammed some kind of story into it by leaving audio logs everywhere. And all you get to see are a few fragments of the ring, which all look basically the same, and underground metal hallways. Halo has such a huge potential for exciting missions and epic set pieces, and 343 utilizes NONE of it."
hazi91,"May 13, 2022",0,"Disc doesn't contain full game, to play even single player you need to download game from internet. It's basically online DRM. Say no to this kind of dirty practices."

There is no possibility to filter maps and modes, expensive addons.

I can say that, when the game doesn't crash, all Season 1 maps are great.

Unfortunately Season 2 modes and maps are pure CRAP. And there is no way to disable these modes and maps :(
DESYNC and instability of the game is even worse than ever!
NAd now MS XBOX bans for leaving the game even it's server instability causes crash.

The only solution is to delete game from console or PC. So I did it.

Halolover9990,"May 3, 2022",9,Halo has returned and is as good as it was back in the Bungie days. admittedly it's multiplayer lacks content and us players are only getting drip feed ounces of new content such as maps and gamemodes however its gameplay is as good and smooth as ever and its campaign definitely makes up for its flaws and shortcomings with a decent story (even though we don't see much of the banished side of conflict which would have been nice) that's compelling enough to keep you invest in the characters and the conflict (also Jega Rdomni' looks awesome) and the environment is amazing with some great graphics and decent side missions (that can be slightly repetitive but only slightly) and cool guns like the skewer which shoots a massive spike and can kill almost anything in one shot. although the vehicles kind of **** except for the razorback which is awesome but overall a great game and a must play for halo fans or FPS fans
OniSenpai,"Apr 29, 2022",7,"El juego a nivel de mecánicas es excelente, el multiplayer es bastante divertido y en general es consistente, sin embargo gráficamente no es nada del otro mundo, no es horrible, pero tampoco sobresaliente, sin embargo donde mas flaquea es durante la campaña, pues se nota a simple vista que no es otra cosa aparte de un prologo.

Por otro lado, el multiplayer es muy divertido pero el contenido lleva meses escaseando."
AlmightyLoaf64,"Apr 29, 2022",9,"Phenomenal game. Definitely game of the year for 2021. Great shooting action, good coherent story, and a glorious world to explore.

dr3114,"Apr 21, 2022",9,"Scoring this game a 9 may be a bit high for some but I am grading it on the gameplay and fun, both of which I feel are offered in excess with Halo Infinite. I liked the campaign and LOVE the online gameplay. Scaling back a few of the complicated Halo 5 gameplay elements works for me, it feels like a true Halo 3 sequel. And it WORKS, I am tired of so many broken games coming out. I agree with many frustrated gamers that Halo needs to offer some new maps, co-op gameplay etc. I suppose I come from a generation that was just used to getting the game you got and that was all. So while I agree the lack of updates has been frustrating, I guess it does not bother me as much."
John3161,"Apr 19, 2022",0,"Unfinished, and stagnant. Overall just a shell of unkept promises saying it will be better later, no updates, and very aggressive micro transactions taking away features so they can sell us a solution. Story is boring, sandbox is a basic Ubisoft game."
Kavelry,"Apr 18, 2022",6,"So I normally don't post metacritic reviews unless I find it really necessary. The only one I did was battlefield 2042 because it absolutely deserved the criticism. However, just like with the really bad I need to do reviews on games that are also really good and that's where Halo comes in. With the travestys for shooters this year in call of duty and battlefield, Halo stands alone as the only sucessful multiplayer shooter of this year. The multiplayer is fun, fast paced and well balanced, with new equipment and weapons that fit in perfectly. The campaign is awesome with 343's transition to a action rpg style campaign with an open world payed off big time. There's a ton of content to explore with a great story and good lore as well and I might argue its one of the best Halo campaigns to date. With the let downs that were Halo 4 and Halo 5 I wasn't sure if 343 would be able to get Halo back to the standard of the Bungie titles. 343, your third attempt was a success and Halo Infinite stands with the best Halo titles that were made. The game is a 9 because of minor issues like xp progression and a lack of playlists but im sure that will get fixed and added along the way. Halo Infinite is what a AAA title should be and it's free, obviously I recommend that anyone should play it.

Edit: I had to come back and lower the score. After going through the campaign, the faluts of Halo Infinte come to light. Halo Infinte multiplayer runs out of content fast to keep you come back and playing 343 did fail in an area of this game and thats as a live service game that they promoted on being. The campaign is still a must play and I would still give the campaign a 9 out of 10. The multiplayer, however, I lower to a 6 out of 10, you will have some fun for a little while but then the content becomes dry and theres no reason to come back."
luq88,"Apr 16, 2022",8,"I'll try to give an honest review here.
First of all I am a Halo universe fan but not a fanboy. Well you may love Halo Infinite but need to remember the level od singleplayer and multiplayer is kinda different.
Single player is focused on an open world with some tunneled missions. It really has an old Halo trilogy feeling. Graphics are great. Shooting is great with well done controls and mouse and keyboard support. Singleplayer is entertaining but have some flaws. Just to mention stupid AI of some enemies and your teammates. Let's say it's 7/10 and still one of the best halo experiences.
Let's talk now about multiplayer. This one is just fantastic! It's like a mix of unreal tournament and more tactical counter strike. I did not have such a good fan in multi for years. Definitely one of the best on consoles. I only wish to have ranked matches improved to get rid of people leaving the match before it's end. Then it would be simply 10/10. I was playing on both controller and mouse keyboard, both have very good feeling, if you change some settings before."

I'm one of the apparent weirdos that loved Halo 5, so skipping so much story between them and going from a game with many different planets and locations to visit to one where you are stuck on another Halo 99% of the time wasn't that interesting setting wise, but story was good so I'll forgive it.

GamerD49,"Mar 25, 2022",7,"Tras haber jugado casi de la MasterChief Collection (uno por mes casi hasta la salida de Infinite), el hype que tenía por este juego era de reventar el medidor, tras jugarlo y terminarlo puedo decir que el juego es bueno, pero hasta ahí. Creo que un 7 es una nota bastante aceptable para él.

Le sienta muy bien el mundo abierto, pero esperaba algo más y se quedó en eso que le sienta muy bien. Su jugabilidad es su punto fuerte como en todos los Halos y en este con el plus del Gancho que te deja hacer casi cualquier cosa para eliminar a tus enemigos o llegar a puntos bastante altos donde el Jefe Maestro no tiene manera de subir.

Su ambientación y su música te pone los pelos de punta y te lanzas a pelear cuál Rambo en la selva jajaja.

Su historia no es del todo increíble como puede ser Halo 3 y Reach, pero no es para nada mala.

XXPX1,"Mar 19, 2022",0,"The best Halo that 343 Industries has put out.

The abilities Master Chief gains through the game are not overdone and the little bit of RPG-like gameplay was not too intrusive but enough that it was worth seeking out.

The gun play feels great and, as someone who remembers very little of Halo 4 & 5, there is a good variety of weapons without any weapons feeling too redundant. That said, the enemy AI is often lacking, often not responding appropriately when being shot at from great distances or just doing silly things in the heat of battle (on Heroic difficulty).

The issue with large distances isn't just the AI behavior though, the rendering distances for enemies is abysmal. It's sad to see such a large and open world that just feels empty.

And while the open world is visually beautiful; it quickly becomes repetitive. The landscape, which is no doubt sculped meticulously, is without any real diversity. Thinking back to Combat Evolved, which had rolling green fields, beach assaults, mountainous canyons and a snowy tundra -- Halo Infinite just feels bland and repetitive.

Then there are the objectives. Five different types of objectives, copied and pasted around the map. And two of them are just ""Collect a Thing"". Yes, there are special scripted areas that are great but there are no real stakes. Skip them or do them; it doesn't matter. No matter what you do in the game, it does not feel like you are making any progress in the war against the Banished.

And I know I said the the world feels bland, but at the same time, it's very ""busy"" making any use of vehicles too cumbersome when compared to simply using the grapple. To make matters worse, vehicles are incredibly fragile to small arms fire. Finally, while we're on the topic, the Scorpion tank controls render the vehicle almost unusable.

The story is mediocre at best and a lot of it is delivered through exposition dumps via the audio logs. This comes off as lazy game design, where some voice actors can knock some story beats out and level designers can scatter them through the world. I simply stopped collecting them once I realized I wasn't even listening to them any more.

There is plenty to be critical about; however, it is a step in the right direction for 343. The game is enjoyable and would is a great foundation for an expansion DLC that adds more objectives."
PickleRickx,"Mar 19, 2022",9,"Classic halo experience, brought to life through the open world mechanics makes this one if the best halo games in long while. With the addition of cooperative play and forge coming later in 2022 the game will be complete and back to that good Ole halo feel after a couple years of falling short."
91919191919191,"Mar 19, 2022",0,"I'm surprised to see the overwhelmingly positive reviews here- but most of them are from around the time of the initial release.
But hey, it's a live service game, so it's always changing right! ...Right?
Nope, the game is EXACTLY how it was in December. And basically how it was during the flights in 2021. The devs have shown a total disregard for player feedback, sometimes giving an inch here and there but outright ignoring the biggest issues or even acting condescending towards the community for daring to give feedback. Their PR people on Twitter/Reddit have been quiet lately, which is good because anytime they open their mouths all that comes out is a million excuses on why the game is in the state it's in.
But there's a war in Ukraine, how can we expect the American-based devs to actually work through these trying times like the rest of us? Yea, that was genuinely an excuse given.
The biggest issue here is the lack of content but it's just the tip of the iceberg- the most work has clearly gone into pushing microtransactions, with the battlepass being gutted right before launch. Season 2 was delayed from the getgo but the game still changed it's UI elements on the day season  2 would've hit- and even now you can find ""Season 2"" written in various places around the menus. They claimed to have fixed the awful ranking system and were resetting it with ""a big update""- this happening the day Season 2 would've gone live, meaning the rank system was already set-up to reset and they literally did nothing.
The gameplay here is solid at its core and that's the only thing leaving at least a little hope for the future. But 343 has shown an unprecedented level of incompetence here, even compared to their past ventures- no forge yet and it's still a long way off, not to mention the lack of co-op campaign. Microsoft needs to either give the project to a different studio or completely clean house in 343, removing all of the upper-level execs and putting in people who can actually make the once headling title for Xbox an actually decent game.

I don't know what they were going to release in 2020, when it was originally going to come out- but considering how horribly barebones this is and their complete lack of being able to do anything because ""the UI can't handle it"" (actual quote), I'd be surprised if there even was a game past the demo they showed. Pitiful excuse of a Halo title, and the playerbase will continue to drop further and further as the game falls into inevitable irrelevancy."

eva3si0n,"Mar 17, 2022",8,"Halo Infinite main System seller Xbox Series? Did you spend $500 million on her? Halo Infinite does not go into any comparison with the original trilogy. It only allows you to forget how the series degraded after Bungue left. Yes, the game is good, it is directly taken from 2001. It looks much better than modern shooters, but there is nothing new. The open world is added for the tick, it is not much different from the open locations of the first parts. But the plot is the biggest failure. Yes, this is not as bad as the 4 part and even more so Guardians, but it is so local that ODST seems a more significant part in the series. Halo Infinite is the best shooter of 2021, but it is a weak shooter in general. Such years in the industry. Halo Infinite was very late, such a game should have been 4 part. Alas for the 3 parts of 343 Industries did not come to the level of the original trilogy, Reach is so out of reach at all."

GAELO1RK,"Mar 15, 2022",9,"Halo infinite is not the best halo but it is not the worst either, I will start with its campaign since it has several details such as its open world which is a good idea but not the best either because it is far from its predecessors, The freedom to improve is a great idea reminds me of many games such as Batman arkham, Dark souls, or rpg games, Its missions are not repetitive and are epic thanks to the open world at every moment there are battles and that is very cool, The multiplayer is something different than the halo 5 reminds me more of a halo reach in my opinion i think halo 5 multiplayer was very good and they could have kept that one. Something that I did not like very much was his battle pass. I would like it if everything could be unlocked with a level or challenges. In summary I think that halo infinite is a very good game but it lacks things"

Ringzn1979,"Mar 9, 2022",8,"Gone are the days of traveling through Halo worlds with a team.  Happily.  The Master Chief's solo return as a shooter is one of the most atmospheric experiences of the year for me.  The tried-and-tested mechanics have been sensibly refined, and the handling of the futuristic shooting club is convincing.  The AI, which is particularly passable in larger groups, ensures that you constantly have to adapt your approach, use the armor gimmicks including the polarizing grappling hook and take advantage of all the advantages that the clever level design offers in both the lush outdoor areas and the interior rooms.  However, in the nicely staged boss fights, 343 rarely has the right sense of when ""enough"" is - they almost always go a tad too long.  And apart from the compelling action?  I expressly welcome the decision to connect the linear campaign missions not only with semi-tubes as before, but also with a largely freely accessible open world.  This is one of the possible correct ways to take the Master Chief into a game-mechanically relevant future.  But 343 Industries wasn't as successful with the mission design of the side activities as they were with the shooter mechanics.  The developers didn't come up with much more than standard missions adapted to the ring world, such as ""kill this"", ""find that"" or ""destroy that"" and can only be the first step.  However, as the campaign story steadily loses its appeal after the promising start, the player's focus becomes too much on those superficial, run-of-the-mill activities that Zeta Halo throws at them.  Make fun?  Absolutely!  Can you do without them?  Yes!  Accordingly, they act more like entertaining fillers than as a useful addition to the campaign tasks.  When it comes to technology, too, there is a lot of light and some shadows.  The bottom line is that 343 got the graphics curve that some wouldn't have expected after the first ""real"" gameplay demos.  Despite all the improvements, it's a long way from being ""the flagship title"" for the Xbox Series X.  Nevertheless, the at least good, in some cases even very good overall picture is not only coherent and respectable (even if Zeta Halo could do with more varied areas), but is also presented fluently.  The shooter as a core competence of Halo is stronger than it has been for a long time."
Miguelmartin201,"Mar 9, 2022",10,"Exelentes mecanicas, buena campaña no tiene la mejor historia pero esta muy bien, gráficos excelentes, el multijugador esta muy bien, pero patina un poco con la personalizacion, espero que en la temporada dos dejen mezclar nucleos de armadura, en definitiva un exelente juego !!"
Cywor,"Mar 9, 2022",7,"The Multiplayer is just nice. I really don't like Multiplayers so far, but in Halo Infinite, it's just pure fun, even for an noob like me. The campaign and the Open World... well, it's okayish, but not more. Reach was the by far better Halo game."
KayJune,"Mar 8, 2022",6,"Halo Infinite was one of my more anticipated titles, which is why it’s a shame the campaign failed to be.. exciting, at least in my opinion, compared to previous titles in the series. If wasn’t bad by any means, but it just didn’t invoke any feeling of interest, and that’s coming from a big Halo fan (myself). The multiplayer is fantastic and smooth, the core gameplay and gunplay is fun and doesn’t feel like a chore, but when it comes to multiplayer content the game feels incredibly incomplete, missing Forge and Co-Op modes that have always been in Halo games at launch, and for a live-service game it’s very disappointing to see a lack of post-launch support and content. Hoping they change direction soon, as the player numbers have been falling the last few months quite drastically."
EternalCore,"Mar 8, 2022",8,"I played and beat this game on Heroic difficulty, so that's the context.

The main reason for an 8 instead of a 9, is b/c I bought the game on ""disc"".. their was NOTHING really on the disc, except sadness & loneliness. Literally. lol.

Honestly, Halo Infinite really blew my expectations away other than the above, from what I'd seen. I loved the grapple mechanic they had! That was the most freaking fun, I've EVER had, playing a Halo game. I loved the ""open world"" aspect of the game... or the little slice we got?

I'm surprised some story expansion DLC hasn't been mentioned so far?

A lot of little things that we saw in the trailers didn't make it into the final game.. Some of environments, animals, etc..  its stuff you expect buying into the marketing.

I loved the fact that I was able to go almost the WHOLE game, with the kit selection I wanted. So basically a lot of shotgunning things in the face. Again it WAS TRULY ENJOYABLE! I loved that. But the game did force me to switch it up occasionally whether I wanted to or not.

in regards to the multiplayer.. I gave it a bit of a shot, the BOTS were really cool feature, basically to warm up before you fight other people.

Being as I'm getting older & don't have the twitch reflexes of the younger set of gamers coming up, it was nice to be able to engage in a different aspect of the game, w/o being put through pure misery. That being said, their seemed to be something off, with the shooting mechanic when engaging in the PvP. I don't know, what it was exactly, & I couldn't put it to words, but something just seemed ""off"" occasionally.

Anyways, the team behind this game, nailed a lot of little things, like the climbing, the vehicle stealing, etc.. from enemies..

I don't have a single regret about my experience with the game & story mode for the most part. It was a very fun romp!

I will say one thing though, the aircraft fragility was annoying as ALL GET OUT THOUGH.. I do remember how much I hated that one aspect.

TL:DR If you like Halo, if you like FPS, for the story, it's worth picking up. I have no regrets with the purchase."
MatthewDavisMed,"Mar 8, 2022",8,"It's multiplayer might not be perfect, but the lengthy campaign and combat certainly makes up for it. It's easily an improvement over the good, but not great 5th entry. Also, it's on game pass. So there ya go."

wipsywaps,"Mar 8, 2022",6,"This review is strictly about the campaign. I always get excited when a new Halo game comes out because it's Halo c'mon! However, after the disappointment that Halo 4 and 5 were, I crossed all of my finger's that Infinite would get it right. I was disappointed again. I enjoyed the new fresh take on the Halo genre and appreciated 343 trying something different. However, it didn't really work for me. The way they designed this game had so much more potential than we were shown. For example, I loved having to clear out the UNSC bases from the Banished but, there was no incentive to come back to them later in the game. I think it would have been better if the bases were attacked by Banished forces and could be recaptured. Also, I loved the open world aspect with the contrasting linear story. But the catch is that the open world is a static biome/landscape filled with almost nothing. Again, there is no incentive to explore the ""world"" because theres nothing interesting in-between the mission areas. In summary, Halo Infinite was fun to the end but I think they missed a lot. My review was going to be 7/10 but I'm lowering it down to 6 just because I didn't know you couldn't go back and replay missions to get skulls you missed. So, you have to replay the entire game to get every skull if you miss a single one in the ""off-map"" missions. Annoying and I'm not doing that."

por otro lado, la historia es absorbente, es un juego corto pero que muestra mucha alma a nivel de desarrollo, logras empatizar con personajes, lo demás se deja para que lo jueguen."

Dperks,"Mar 3, 2022",9,"Halo Infinite is a definite step up from 343s other installments. The gunplay has never been smoother the weapon sandbox is great I found my self utilizing every weapon in  the game at one point or another. Movement has gotten much better while the new movement options in 5 felt like a gimmick the inclusion of the grapple hook really evaluated the whole experience and made the act of getting around in a fight a lot of fun. Having items that you carry around the whole game like a deployable shield or enemy scanner to be used anytime is also a great new feature that just made gunplay more engaging. My only complaint I have for it is I wish that it was easier to pick in the heat of battle as trying to navigate by tapping the d pad to the right then selecting was kind of annoying. The plot I thought was a lot more interesting then the other games although it did feel kinda lack luster but I appreciate them slimming the cast down and giving us a more concise story where 5 had like way to many characters where most did nothing. The Banished are a great new enemy you really learn and get a feel for them and they feel distinct unlike the covenant remanence of the last 2 games. And unlike the promethiens their a lot of fun to fight. And the enemy A.I has certainly been improved while not perfect enemy's act and behave alot more like how you'd expect. And the new art style change to a much more classic and simple design is a welcome change and really appreciated because my god the covenant were so ugly in the last games. The open world aspect was neat but it could of been utilized more. Like some actual side quests or some big large scale battles would of been coll. And the whole taking back the ring with these little marine bases feels a bit tagged on like they don't really impact anything it feels. I would of licked for our home base to be more dynamic changing and growing as the game progressed. Another thing I'm not a big fan about is that visually most of the levels look the same which can make them a bit exhausting and boring. However one thing this game nailed is the boss fights which really surprised me. While 2 tried some fights and they were kinda **** and 5 had one okay fight they used over and over again this game has a good amount of boss fights that are all fun and some are even challenging. Overall the campaign is great but I do see potential for it to be even better.

And for the multiplayer let me just say I hate battle pass progression systems. They aren't fun and the fact you only get experience for the challenges is really annoying and deters me from playing game modes I actually wanna play. The customization is really good but I don't know why it needs to be split between different armor types like let me mix and match whatever I want. Although having different loadouts for customization would be cool and its kinda like that now but they should expand on that idea at some point. Now my only other real other complaint for the multiplayer is the lack of maps they really got to add more maps because their already getting kinda old. Not that their bad but it just feels like I'm playing the same ones all the time. Luckily the gunplay just like the campaign is a lot of fun and much better experience then 4 or 5 on the multiplayer side of things. The multiplayer is really fun I just wish the progression system was actually rewarding and that their was an actual level to everyone's profile."

CPLBLo18,"Mar 2, 2022",10,"Campaign was awesome, open world concept adds a great wrinkle and keeps it fresh. Best Halo game to date."
Xplocion,"Mar 2, 2022",9,"The good:
A new Halo has arrived. It is starred by the Chief. There are new weapons. There are new enemies. There is a huge open and multi level map to explore in Zeta Halo. The open world doesn't feel empty. The Chief taking on the responsibility of spearheading the offense feels very epic. Music is situational. There is custom skill growth (skill tree). More content on the way. The enemy AI is very advanced and rewarding (if there is a challenge, they organize, garrison, arm themselves, flank you, hunt you down). Some achievements went off the scale. With ingenuity you can do very WTF things. The Weapon as an assistant is equal parts funny, naive, and absurd. The handling of textures is incredible. The draw distance is huge and they took their time to adjust to the changes in light and the different heights and levels within the ring (they don't use the cheap trick of fog or clouds). Great fun exploring the map, swinging, climbing the Towers,

The bad:
It annoys me that the bootleg doll aesthetic returns, discarding the “realistic” aesthetic of the Tank with legs concept. The new weapons are fine (nothing more). They didn't coddle much of the missions. More content on the way (when?). I miss some “punch” to the music. I feel like a Soft Reboot although some Prometheans are out there lost. They had said that the multiplayer could be separated from the game and they are there together on the record. Few biomes to explore.

Lo Meh!:
Personally, I'm tired of open worlds, I can't stand them, and it bothers me that Halo jumps on that trend just to fit in, not because I'm comfortable with it. Keeping with how much I hate open worlds it bothers me that Master Chief is the one using the grappling hook, couldn't another new character be using the grappling hook and saving the Chief? (A la Donkey Kong: Diddy's Kong Quest) because there are so many characters that use a hook that looks more like a skin of Nate Spencer (Bionic Commando) or Rico Rodriguez (Just Cause) with the Chief's suit swinging from the Zeta Halo. They forgot about Halo 5 Guardians, Perseverance Witness and the Guardians, Cadet Kelly and the blue team…"
NextPlayer_it,"Mar 2, 2022",9,"Se si vogliono cercare difetti sono l’assenza della modalità cooperativa e della Forgia ma già sappiamo che verranno risolti con patch future. Ma è un peccato, dato che la nuova struttura aperta avrebbe reso molto più interessante affrontare il gioco in cooperativa. Avremo una scusa per ritornarci!

343 industries ha lottato per guidare Halo nella giusta direzione sin dal lancio di Halo 4 nel 2012, lo studio è finalmente arrivato ad un ottimo equilibrio con Halo Infinite. Il gioco onora con successo l’eredità narrativa, mantiene l’amatissimo gunplay di Halo, ma senza la paura di aggiungere nuovi elementi. Nelle intenzioni dichiarate dagli sviluppatori Halo Infinite sarà supportato a lungo fino a dieci anni. Spero che non supportino solo la parte multigiocatore  ma che continuino anche la campagna aggiungendo nuove missioni e trama perché se così fosse mi hanno già venduto tutte le future espansioni.

Sono felice che dopo anni di travagliato sviluppo il prodotto finale funzioni e soprattutto sia bello da giocare perché la cosa più curata è il gameplay. Personalmente mi sono divertito tantissimo anche in solitaria. Diventare il potente “demone” che libera un pianeta dall’occupazione aliena salvando l’universo da… ok basta si sfocia nello spoiler.  Scopritelo voi!"
TW1TCHYGAM3R,"Mar 2, 2022",4,"The Good: The game feels like Halo. Now its running the same but modified engine from all the previous Halo titles so the physics should be the same but Infinite does this better than Halo 4 and 5. Story is short and sweet but there is that open world aspect now that really ties everything together. The AI seem very Halo CE like and that is a very good thing.

The Bad: Multiplayer is a massive mess. You know it, I know it, 343 knows it, YouTube creators know it, and professional gamers know it. The netcode is a mess with horrible desync issues, Rank is effected by social and bot matches, and theater and custom games are broken. Broken broken broken. This game is a mess.

The Ugly: As a 'Live Service' game we have no content and absolutely no communication from 343 Industries. This game is three months in with no new maps, weapons or new game modes (bye attrition....). This is unacceptable as far as Live Service goes. Look at all these other live service games that pump out new content constantly.

343i did Halo fans dirty and failed to follow Bungie's footsteps. 343i is a false reclaimer to the Mantle of Responsibility."

OdoubleP,"Feb 27, 2022",8,"Solid game, best Halo since Halo 3. Enjoyed the open world aspect. The grapple hook was great! Story was ok. Nothing special but not bad either. I felt it was very samey samey at times which was ok for Halo back in the day but thought they could’ve put a bit more into that. Overall though, I enjoyed it, the MP I’ve stopped playing now but I couldn’t put it down for about a month. So as an overall package it was a good effort and I think Halo is moving in the right direction"
Micro4jkl456,"Feb 25, 2022",3,"I really don't understand how this game is getting such high scores. This game is horribly flawed. It spits in the face of the game design that proceeded it. The guns feel worthless on normal difficulty. They have no impact. Every gun you pickup feels worthless against whatever you are fighting. The shotgun is pointless, The bulldog now takes 3 shots to kill most enemies and it'S ammo is severely limited. The number of cheap shots from the enemies is insane. I beat halo 3 on the highest difficulty and I had less problems doing that. At least I was able to drive the freaking vehicles from a to be without have to be frickin Magellan. The Scorpion tank can't drive down the road ways because of crap design. The mongoose steers like is covered in anal lube and bacon grease. So you have a bunch of crap weapons and vehicles on a crap map filled with cheap enemies and a storyline that has zero interest to me and is so poorly connected to the previous game that it is absolutely pointless. Here is the games biggest sin. You can't adjust difficulty at all and after you start the campaign. You finding this too hard? Screw You! Start Over! This a a vomit stain on the franchise. Go play the Master Chief collection and 4 instead. ODST was far better then this, Halo Wars was better than this. This is Call of duty with aliens. this might as well be made by modern day Bungie it has the same quality and the same number of microtransactions. If you want to play it. Do so on game pass. Don't pay full price."
Germylouis,"Feb 25, 2022",6,"This is more so for a a multiplayer review since that is a much bigger aspect than the campaign in my humble opinion. At its core, MP is solid. But there are so many issues with this game I fail to understand how this game was anywhere near a 2020 release date let alone 2021. 343 has mismanaged this franchise. Virtually no content for season one, there was a beta to fix issues but the same issues persist post mid season1 update, maps in BTB can feel unbalanced, tanks spawn at the worst times that can give a dominating team even more firepower, matchmaking is still buggy, I still glitch out hard when I get hijacked, high power  is the most unbalanced map I’ve ever played and it’s 1 of only 3 BTB STILL, if I get 100 kills in a game of slayer someone with 0 with still gets the same amount of exp post game, leader boards from previous game don’t function correctly, I can’t mute one person I have to spend 20 seconds in the menu mid game to mute all, I get shot around corners constantly, rocket launchers damage output wildly inconsistent, etc.

I could write a book. With the lack of content and still buggy mess **** almost 4 months since the start of the Beta, no wonder player counts are so low. Luckily it’s not as bad as Vangaurd or Battlefield!! Fml."

GLICKY,"Feb 24, 2022",10,"It's a good game with great core gun play with strategies. Campaign game play is good, You can fight against characteristics enemies with various weapons and vehicles. Also fight with your marines and give powerful weapons to them whatever you want. Armor abilities are helpful to fight. Drop wall to take cover yourself, threat sensor to find enemies where they are, thruster to avoid enemy's dangerous attacks quickly. And the grappling hook is the quite big one. This is VERY useful to shifting anywhere, you can climb 90°cliffs when you upgrade grappling hook. The great mobility of grappling hook increase non linearity of this campaign's semi open world experience. You not need to reach your destination through uncomfortable ways, just use grappling hook, jump and climb to your destinations. The side quests are useful to increase your abilities and get more power weapons and vehicles to use. But if you want, you not need to do these side quests. You can play main missions of this game without any side quests. They are just options if you want. You can easily finish this campaign on easy or normal difficulty.

The story is quite okay. The 343 remove there many failures of halo 4 and 5's storytelling and it's a good thing. But some problems included like you need to find some audio logs to help to understand story more easier and the villains are not much impact in this campaign. But the characteristics of protagonists such as Master Chief, The Weapon, Pilot are great. Based on these results, I hope 343 will make more better stories for next Halo series.

The multiplay core gameplay is great. All players start with AR and sidekick. And they fight each other for victory with more good weapons and abilities which they are spawns on the map. 4vs4 matches are quite tight but it gives fun to fight with mixture of various weapons and ability items. 12vs12 the Big Team Battle is more fun than 4vs4 arena matches for casual players. The larger scale than 4vs4 with various vehicles, more weapons, item spawns and random ordinance of power weapons and power items.

But the management of multiplay is not good now. The shop item's price is expensive, the cross-core armor customization is not available now, no more contents such as new maps, mods, weapons in season 1. 343 only gives bug fixes and stability fixes right now so if you want more contents, you will need to return when season 2 or season 3 with forge mod is arrival. Honestly if I can give a score only a management of this multiplayer right now I'll give just 3/10.

Anyway the core game plays of campaign and multiplay are great. The story is quite okay. The only problem of 343 right now is they MUST do better with their multiplay management."

NxtDoc,"Feb 24, 2022",0,"Yet again, Microsoft and 343i have shown their true colors, and somehow it gets ignored. Halo Infinite released unfinished, unpolished, and laced with egregious predatory Micro-Transactions.  Halo Infinite has factually less content than Halo 3,at launch, with more than double the development cycle. How does a Halo launch without Team Slayer?  You bet that Micro-Transactions storefront was working day one though.

Again, no forge at launch? The Banished are cool enemies, but again the way the world was laid out, you can not go back and explore.  Yet it is being presented as a ""open world""  So if you miss something you have to restart the whole story.

Microsoft and Xbox present this package as a ""Games as a service"".  But what they really mean is they ship and incomplete product, and patch it on the go until it is deemed ""good enough"" and charge for a ton if overpriced ""skins"".  See Ryse, Halo 5 Guardians, Halo Wars 2, Halo Infinite, Gears of War 4 & 5, Forza Motorsport 5, 6 and 7, Sea of Thieves, Crackdown 3, State of Decay 2, and even under MS Publishing Rise of the Tomb Raider had Loot Boxes.

El gunplay es impresionante de lo mejor que se ha visto en mucho tiempo en los FPS es algo muy adictivo gracias a la tecnica de arrastrarse y el gancho lo volvieron un multijugador completo y divertido, aparte de que es muy satisfactorio matar a los desterrados en la campaña.

La historia podre no ser la mejor pero nos muestra mas la humanidad del jefe maestro y como se desarrolla con el personaje de el Piloto y Cortana. A este juego lo veo con un potencial enorme para historia y no dudo que en sus expansiones pueda hacerlo un juego de 10/10"

Snake_Bira,"Feb 22, 2022",7,"game with few technical news and weak innovation, well below expectations.
It might seem tempting to reduce Halo Infinite to an 'open world Halo' that worked, but the new game from 343 Industries is much more than that. First of all, it is indeed the best game from the studio, created in 2007 precisely to take care of the franchise after Bungie ended work on the Master Chief and company universe.
Halo's main draw has always been its gameplay, and it's a relief to see how 343 nailed it with Infinite. Controlling Master Chief is something pleasant and safe, the character's movements convey a security that helps to be sure of what you are doing, the timing of each action and how to better plan for each combat. This is also worth the game's arsenal, always a highlight in any Halo episode. Each weapon has different style and functions and the game design always encourages you to use different models and risk new strategies, which helps keep the duels different. It's even possible to stick to a few models and experience little in battles, but Halo Infinite rewards boldness by presenting different (and often more practical) ways to deal with enemies, especially using some scenario interactions, such as ramps, holes and boxes. explosive. The big highlight in this department, however, is the new hook attached to the Master Chief's arm. The feature works so well that it's hard to imagine it wasn't already part of previous episodes. At first, the grappling hook helps to reach higher platforms, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Fast and practical, the grappling hook helps you move around the scenario faster in general, whether to explore, attack and defend. It's much easier to use the grappling hook to scale a building or just hit the farthest ground and escape farther than to run away. Not only that, the grappling hook is also a weapon and you can attach to enemies to lunge at them and land a punch. With some improvements, you can even paralyze opponents and use the tool not only to get around, but also to control groups of opponents"

Ooohpieceacandy,"Feb 21, 2022",0,Just a **** game in general nothing new here same old **** halo has always been and just here to review bomb becaue people do it to playstation games because they have no life so if you can't beat them join them I guess? But really this Is Microsofts flagship series what a **** joke
meyerpark,"Feb 21, 2022",10,I love this game. Halo Infinite is a true competitive game with active live service and continuous updating with more content and Halo has best replay value

d0ntm1ndm32,"Feb 21, 2022",7,"The action and moment to moment gameplay is phenomenal! Unfortunately tho, I feel like its open world design doesn't offer much, it has no variety whatsoever and is empty in general which inevitably detracts a bit from its true potential in my personal opinion.

The multiplayer, whilst being really fun, can get pretty boring really fast and the progression leaves much to desire.

I also feel like Halo's narrative is lacking but that rarely ever was the franchise's true strength and ultimately, I feel like no one who's a fan of first person shooters would deny that Halo's gunplay mechanics are some of the best in the industry!"
scruffa,"Feb 21, 2022",9,"The game is fun. I can switch my PC on, load in, and just play. It reminds me of what gaming is supposed to be.

Of all the factors I rate, the movement is by far the best. The gunplay is, well, it's Halo so it's always incredible.

My only complaint is the battle pass. I know, that is an easy target but it is bothersome.I hope they fix it."
Fhaheenk,"Feb 21, 2022",5,I first watched someone play this on youtube before trying it out myself on a friend's XSX. Honestly its not bad at all. I wouldn't say it revolutionises the genre and the graphics are OK but the game gets more hate than it deserves. 343 studios did a nice job

PMG-Writer,"Feb 19, 2022",9,"Microsoft and the developers from 343 Industries created a first-person shooter in an open world for the console with ""Halo Infinite"". The story is told intensively and excitingly. The supporting characters always have a funny quip to lighten the mood. In terms of gameplay, we get a lot and especially the grappling hook is simply successful and shows you new approaches in the course of the game. It's a pity that we can't play together. Instead, you can play the great and playfully excellent multiplayer. On the whole, ""Halo Infinite"" has become a really great game and should not be missing in any fan's collection."
willo116,"Feb 19, 2022",9,"I was a little concerned at first with Halo Infinite with all the controversy and lack of information regarding the campaign nearing the game release.

But all those worries went away as soon as I played this game.

Like everyone else I first experienced the game while playing the multiplayer aspect. The game mechanics feels great, very solid. I enjoyed all the new additions to the gameplay mechanics and the multiplayer games are really fun to play. It still needs some work regarding options and match style but I’m hopeful that more will be added along the way.

The game definitely was released incomplete, I’m pretty sure it was hectic development cycle but as a Halo fan I was glad to get some new Halo and what I expected I enjoyed and it was free (multiplayer) so I’m definitely not as critical as others regarding this aspect.

The campaign I experienced through Xbox GamePass and I loved it, the story was good and I really loved the open terrain of this game as it definitely captures the best moments from the original Halo CE game. I also liked the side missions and secrets/collectibles. There’s simply plenty to do here and that’s good.

Now 343 still has some work to do like add the ability to replay missions, more multiplayer match styles, etc. but the idea for this game was to be an expanding/evolving experience through the years so I’m looking forward to getting more Halo content over time, so I’m overlooking some of the negatives and concentrating on all the goods we can currently enjoy."
bl00dborne,"Feb 18, 2022",0,This has to be (along with the rest of the Halo series) the worst pile ive ever witnessed.  Generic AF shooter thats over rated to hell.  It makes Destiny look good and that aint all that great either.  I deffo would not recommend this garbage.

Sabito7966,"Feb 17, 2022",5,"Decent campaign, you can feel it was rushed but it's still fun to play.

Multiplayer: Terrible launch. I could go on for hours about what doesn't work in this game
Spawns are terrible. Netcode is terrible. No balance patch or new content for 4 months except for two very basic event the first one being fiesta (trash) the second one is an elimination mode which is pretty good.
The cosmetic are cool but locked behind multiple pay walls when the battlepass and event should be more than enough.

If this game doesn't drastically improve in season 2 I will lower the score to a 1."

You can do what you want, how you want. And even after the 4th playthrough it still has surprise's in the campaign."
Kiratomi,"Feb 15, 2022",2,"This review is based solely on the multiplayer game aspects... Single player is fine. But the focus and issues are coming from the online portion of the game.

Let's start positive and begin with the positive. The skeleton of the game (the gameplay) is phenomenal. Some of the best. The controls are smooth and the mechanics work for this game.

Now for the negatives. Which is a much longer list unfortunately...

This game is money hungry. mid 2010s EA money hungry. They were given an extra year to fix a lot of issues, and released even less content than was planned. They cut the battle pass into nothing and all of the ""good"" stuff if locked behind paying. Yes, the game is free to play, and no, it doesn't change the game at all to have those things... Except for the fact that it does. Halo has, for a pretty long while now, leaned heavily into customization to make your Spartan the most unique to you that it can be. And 343i is removing that ability behind weird decisions like Armor Coatings, Armor Cores, TERRIBLE microtransaction prices, and a very limited supply of options in general. This game is supposed to last for ten years? Maybe in ten years they will have the content of the previous Halo releases...

Next on the list: The online play is iffy at best. How on earth do you have such an issue with Desync and lag? Big Team Battle was broken for two months and still is having issues. The updates are always ""we are trying to fix this"" but there is nothing good about the online experience. Forced crossplay upsets both PC and console gamers, ping issues galore, and the aforementioned desync regularly ruins the online experience. Not to even get into the terrible ranking system that they now have to reset because they even recognized it was so terrible.

Finally, the lack of a plan for this game and the lack of information for the future of this game (a roadmap) is completely missing. There is no reason to play right now other than fomo for the typically awful ultimate challenge... which is a whole other issue as the challenge system is garbage as well.

This game is not currently in a state that is worth playing if you are on the fence. The gameplay is fine, but the game itself is barely there. The bones are great, but 343i needs to build it back up from the beginning and basically start over for the game to be what the fans actually wanted, and what this game needs to be successful for a decade. It is already under a 10th of the normal players, and all of my friends have given up on it... and I am not far behind them if there isn't some huge change soon. No forge, no being able to play missions back, no lobbies, lack of map selection, weapons pools is lackluster, armors **** compared to previous titles, mtx prices are absurd... There is a LOT wrong right now and no promise to fix them outside of more delays and empty ""we're looking into it"" posts on Twitter.

343i... Please don't let this game die. It deserves so much better."

Fuera de eso, el título presenta una de las mejores historias en la historia de los videojuegos, muy emotiva, excelente Score musical, los gráficos están mucho muy definidos en Xbox series x, es impresionante como los sitios metálicos tienen unos reflejos realmente impresionantes, el gameplay es sobresaliente, usas cambio de ritmo con placaje, gancho, muros defensivos, velocidad y un interesante vigía, retoma experiencias (UX) de otros juegos como Quake 2 (tomar una celda de energía), mundo abierto como GTA o Zelda, armas mucho más ingeniosas, pero sobretodo el guión es magnífico. Tiene interesantes giros argumentales, realmente impresiona la obra maestra ante la que estamos por parte de Microsoft, sin duda alguna es el mejor título que le visto a 343. Algo que le faltó (además de los conceptos del E3 2018), es el Gravemind y los flood, argumentalmente es la mejor versión de Cortana. Por momentos tiene diversión, drama y tonos serios. A mí forma de ver, es (por fin), el verdadero Halo 4, y mejor Shooter del año, Microsoft y los fans necesitaba esta saga y un digno representante de los sucesores de bungie. Vale cada centavo ya sea del game pass o del juego completo. Es un juego que no debe de ser pasado por alto y debe de ser jugado por cualquier persona que posea un Xbox One a un Xbox series."
JBravoG,"Feb 8, 2022",9,"Story was such an improvement over Halo 5. The addition of The Weapon and the pilot were welcomed, and they each had some memorable scenes in the campaign. The gameplay is honestly the best in the series in my opinion. It feels so fresh and new, yet still remaining true to it's roots. And this is coming from someone who played every Halo. Of course, the introduction of the grapple hook is so fun. It really pushes this games gameplay mechanics even further. The other equipment add-ons are also nice features like the drop shield, threat sensor, and thruster (only listing campaign equipment for now). Now despite me liking this campaign, after completion it left me wanting more. I felt that having more biomes would add to the experience as well as going deeper with the story. There are parts of the timeline that feel incomplete. It does also hurt a bit that there is no campaign coop at launch. However, it is expected that we will receive campaign expansions, so that gives me hope that they can go above and beyond with this story.

On the multiplayer side of things, like I said previously, this game in my opinion has the best gameplay with welcomed new additions. Everything is smooth and feels like a true Halo game with modern elements. It does hurt that there is no forge at launch, and it would be nice to get more weapons/vehicles/maps. Though I will say, despite some of the flaws around this entry, I believe they have built the foundation for an excellent game that will be supported for the coming years."

Syedzubi,"Feb 8, 2022",8,"Simply fantastic and awesome
I am big halo fan, I started playing the halo games in the masterhief collection, and what a collection it is  , simply brilliant i played all games in that collection except for halo odst, so I have a pretty good Idea what halo is all about, coming to the Halo infinite, I only have this to say, just play the game , it is awesome , well made, the gameplay is top notch and the story is simply great, for all halo fans out there this is simply a must play game, and for those who never played a halo game before this is a great entry to start with, but to know and to have a full understanding of what is happening in the game, i would recommend playing the masterchief collect first, from Halo CE to halo 4 , halo odst is also good but I did not play it. Halo 5 yes you should play that too as **** all in all a great game"
TheVezyrQ,"Feb 8, 2022",7,Good game but not the best. Story is easy and i think its like CTRL C + CTRL V.
zachpacreviews,"Feb 7, 2022",9,"Halo Infinite reinvigorates and innovates the franchise with a breathtaking, detailed open world, a variety of upgrades, with a ton of development and growth from Master Chief.

As soon as I started playing, I couldn't help but smile. Halo was one of the first games I played on my first ever game console, the Xbox 360, back in 2013. Now, playing this, I couldn't help but think back on the good ole times. This is definitely fan service at its finest.

GAMEPLAY
The gameplay is action-packed, wild, fun, and innovative. I love running around hitting the enemy with the butt of my gun and firing every last shot into them, praying to God, I don't die or run out of ammo.
The side-objectives consist of going in, blowing **** up, hitting button, and getting out. And this repeats. Another variant of side-objectives is the FOBs, kill all Banished, hit a button, your done. This also repeats. In other words, the side-objectives are repetitive, but can be fun. I just wish they would've switched it up a bit for every objective.

NARRATIVE
Master Chief gets a lot of growth as a character, and I'm proud to say that I care for the Chief.
Atriox is a memorable name, but as a villain, his character ****; he's not fleshed out enough, his motives are unclear, and I really couldn't tell you anything about him besides he sounds like a demon and looks like he's out of Planet of the Apes. Hopefully, in the next installment, his character can be saved, by giving us his backstory, his motives, and really expand on and go in-depth with his character, because we certainly don't see that here.
The Weapon is a sweet and loveable replacement of Cortana. I actually enjoyed her more than Cortana, and I definitely want to see more of and see their relationship expand in the next installment.
The Pilot shows nothing but emotion.. Him and Master Chief's friendship evolves throughout the game, and again, I'd love to see more of this and it be expanded upon in the next installment.
We expand on the deletion of Cortana, why she was deleted, and it haunting Master Chief, and also causing him trust issues.
All around, the story is alright. It's a little shallow in some areas than others, but other than that, that's about it.

MULTIPLAYER
The MP is very, very addictingly fun. It's action-packed, it's wild, it can get crazy, and YOU CAN **** TEABAG **** Though, it's lacking content; such as Forge and Co-Op. Also lacking on modes and maps, which I hope to see more of in the next content drop.

JeffMen,"Feb 6, 2022",8,"Campagin was a solid 7/10 i liked the new characters introduced and Eschrium was a great villian for infinite, and Its combat had an amazing flow to it. Graphics were nothing revolutionary but still amazing. Its open world on the other hand felt empty and its side quests felt repetitive, the FOB bases works for halo, a good fast travel point and a place to get vehicles and soldiers not too bad. The Multiplayer was great aswell really feels like old school halo but with a modern twist. But its progression system is mediocre and the cosmetics are pretty bad but nothing they cant fix. Even with its flaws halo infinite feels like a turning point for the series and im excited to see whats instore for this game!"

ptxmalca,"Feb 4, 2022",1,"Halo has always been my favourite franchise but this modern gaming stuff has to stop. I am sure all good reviews are from early gameplay and the hype of campaign.

Game is incomplete and broken. Not multiple playlist and game variations, no coop, no forge, no good theatre, no level select on campaign. The ranked is broken and punishes you in a way that takes the fun out of it.

The game is boring with such lacking content. Btb is awful in comparison to halo 3. The story is bad since halo 5. Might be the best master chief but the campaign lacks epic moments most of the cool **** happens in audio logs. They desecrated one of the main character for no reason and no true explanation. I am sorry but 343 has to go. 3/3 strikes."

Skurttish,"Feb 1, 2022",7,"I only played the campaign, no multiplayer.

The gameplay was good—classic Halo. Same for the sound and etc. The level design and world design was standard for a Halo game—nothing really impressed me, and nothing stood out as particularly ‘bad’, but the world definitely could have been more varied.

I think the biggest issue for me was that the game’s writers had an unfortunate tendency to introduce these really dramatic, emotional crescendos before the player had a chance to really like the protagonists. It seemed too early to have Master Chief playing the role of sympathetic father, or to have another main character crying about his identity—those scenes could have been shorter and kept closer to the end of the game, when the writers had more emotional capital to cash in with the audience.

It was a normal AAA FPS game, and I had fun, but it wasn’t spectacular."
Mike_Zulu,"Feb 1, 2022",4,"Not a return to form. Terrible multiplayer maps, barely functioning netcode makes multiplayer very unfun.

phoreman,"Feb 1, 2022",8,"Despite some of the issues of the game, the overall gameplay is amazing. The campaign is good, but its hard to impress me with a FPS campaign. THe multiplayer is great. Return to BR being the main precision weapon pleased a lot of people. The removal of the spartan abilities from Halo 5 while adding equipment was a great choice. They have a lot of work to do to make this game 9/10 for me, so thats why I gave it 8/10. Even that review score might be at least a little biased."

10 out of 10 the killer app for Xbox."
pranavdhawan,"Jan 29, 2022",7,"Halo Infinite evolved the gameplay and storytelling in a semi-open world aspect with great success. It encapsulated the lore well enough to deliver an interesting story but failed in an overlooked way. The game, inspite of being open world feels off in sense of different environments. While previous Halo games are known for their vast variety of in-game locations and interactive levels, Infinite lacks absurdly in that area which leads to repetitive gameplay. The story evolves around literally 3 characters, which in their own respect and well written and interesting, leave behind the Halo feel to the game."
Galniac,"Jan 29, 2022",9,"Vue les critiques négative que l'on peut voir sur internet je m'attendais pas à grand chose et heureusement j'ai été très agréablement surpris de ce halo même si il n'est pas parfait je suis content de la direction qu'il ont pris pour moi ce halo mérite sa place dans la grande saga halo contrairement à halo 5 et jai adoré jouer à ce halo un mélange d'ancienneté et de nouveautés, je trouve que halo 5 et infinite font la transition entre l'ancienne saga et la nouvelle qui arrive. certes il n'est pas légendaire mais il faut bien comprendre qu'il y avait un niveau très élevé de c'est prédécesseur légendaire: (halo 1, 2 et 3) ps: je ne considère pas halo 4 comme un halo légendaire même si il est bien. En tout cas j'ai hâte de jouer au prochain halo qui vas certainement rentrer vraiment dans le vif du sujet maintenant que le problème cortana est résolu, il va certainement être excellent et espérons légendaire"
quebecname,"Jan 29, 2022",0,"Unfinished CoD game. Campaign is trash unlike all other Halo games. MP is barely there. A few maps all bad unbalanced gameplay, rush for weapons"
VoidWinter,"Jan 29, 2022",6,"(Note:  This is all story mode, I do not do PvP.)  It's not a bad game.  However, it isn't really all that great either.  I've played all the other Halo games and this is the first where the story was too weak to hold my interest.  Gameplay in general feels inferior to Halo 5.  Various game mechanics are simply given to you and their use is not explained.  This made the first boss fight (the elite that could cloak himself) after I reached the open world part far more difficult than it should have been.  Halo 5 got the weapons perfect, but Infinite feels like a few steps backward in their handling, ADS behavior and general balance. The very first squad I tried to rescue wasn't anywhere near where it was indicated on the map and it was a real pain to get to where they actually were.  The grappling mechanic was clunky to say the least, and only seemed to work when it wanted to. Co-op not being included at release was a major oversight, and I may try it again when I can tag team it with a friend or two.  Overall, like I said, it's not a bad game, but it doesn't really feel right and is having a hard time keeping my interest.  It just is what it is, and what it is is below what I expect from Halo."
Draconsa,"Jan 29, 2022",10,"This story combines perfectly “the banished” arc with master chief's. Most missions didn’t feel repetitive and challenged you to use the new abilities master chief got.

Torgall,"Jan 26, 2022",6,"Review only for the campaign. After the big hype, I decided to play my first Halo game ever. Because it's a whole series I thought the plot will heavily rely on at least the previous title. After copious reading and watching recaps on YT, it turns out that they simply scrapped the buildup of Halo 5. Instead of continuation, we have a kind of soft reboot where throughout the game we learn about events that had already happened. I hoped to find something more than plot exposition about things that 343 wrote off in the background.

The game begins on a high note but loses a lot of its charm when we progress to the open-world part where things get very repetitive: Go to point A; Plug in the Blue woman to the thingy; Listen to Blue woman talking with Green Man; proceed to do the same thing in other parts of the map; Oh sometimes the big red guy talks through a hologram. Before you have a chance to plug the blue woman into some apparatus you have to destroy some coils, get power cells and clear out FOBs to get access to fast travel, weapons, and vehicles. If you are a completionist you can do other very repetitive things like destroying propaganda towers or collecting audio logs.

The plot is really weak, and like I said it consists mostly of Master Chief talking with the Weapon. I liked the combat, especially the grappling hook that allowed me to be more dynamic and creative on the battlefield. Boss fights are simply awful. You are trapped in a small arena with a guy that is simply a bullet sponge. They made the combat area small to hide the fact that boss AI is basic, helped by high damage and HP. The hammer guy is the worst boss I fought in a long time. He is not challenging in a good way, this fight is simply annoying. If you go into it with bad weapons you are screwed because he jumps across the room and 1-2 shots you.

The grunts made my day many times with their humorous quips, so big thumbs up for that - the grunt communications officer is an especially funny one."

The game lacks in changes in environment variance....I would have liked to see, urban areas and cities start up, and cold areas. The game is a major step forward from, Halo 5 (Horrible game)!   I just wish they spent more time on explaining the story regarding the campaign."
iam3men2,"Jan 25, 2022",10,"The best of the entire Halo saga, the master chief has returned in a big way with this installment, without a doubt it was worth the wait, it is one of the absolutely essential games."
Broyax,"Jan 25, 2022",8,"Le nouveau Halo est passé au monde ouvert (pour la grande majorité de sa campagne) et c’est ce pouvait lui arriver de mieux ! il est ainsi devenu un peu far cryien sur les bords… avec des avant-postes à prendre et quelques (grandes) bases à libérer… sans compter des cibles prioritaires à éliminer et des escouades de Marines isolées à aider !

Si une certaine répétition peut se faire sentir, elle est rapidement compensée par des avantages, comme de nouvelles pétoires et/ou des variantes des flingues existants qui permettent de nettoyer avec encore plus d’efficacité ! le Major, déjà seigneur des anneaux, devient Monsieur Propre : avec lui, tout disparaît d’une manière ou d’une autre, notamment tous ces ennemis qui veulent le tuer (désintégrés ou explosés les **** les moyens ou les gros salopards !

Et à ce propos, le combat a connu quelques ajustements bienvenus qui l’ont rendu beaucoup plus dynamique et puissant, endiablé et percutant ; ce n’est pas Doom certes mais ça s’en rapproche, ma foi. Les affrontements bénéficient également d’une IA très améliorée et en outre, il y a toujours quelque chose à utiliser sur le champ de bataille (aisément repérable grâce au scan inédit) : des tourelles, armes, munitions à volonté ou des véhicules qui aident grandement à botter le cul des « parias » qui contrôlent tout l’anneau.

La campagne elle-même malgré un début mollasson et des niveaux (vers la fin) qui enchaînent un peu trop les salles (à nettoyer) s’avère très intéressante à suivre, même si la narration n’est pas toujours très claire -un défaut récurrent dans tous les scénarios de jeux vidéo, hélas. D’autant plus que bien des évènements font référence aux Halo précédents… et j’avais quasiment tout oublié de ceux-là.

L’autre grief concerne le monde ouvert trope escarpé et vertical et ce malgré le grappin certes très utile ; la mobilité est en effet critiquable sur ce Halo… à moins de se procurer un engin volant mais ils sont rares… il aurait fallu une vraie mini-carte soit dit en passant.

Enfin, signalons les effets sonores très réussis, la VF impeccable et les graphismes… très réussis eux aussi sur Series X, le tout en 4K/60 : c’est splendide ! Halo a donc bien évolué tout en restant… authentiquement Halo. Un beau tour de force quand on y pense avec de surcroît dans cet épisode une direction artistique tout à fait remarquable."
1001Gameslive,"Jan 25, 2022",7,"Advertised as open world game... Instead Navi 2.0 harasses you every 5 seconds to complete story mission and there's no way to shut her up. Once you reach the spire, fast travel is shut down and you are forced along a  linear path from that point. Boss fights start off decent but then quickly become the easiest things ever (stand there snipe boss from distance nonsense). Useless thruster that serves no purpose and is entirely useless period below level 3, literally easier just to use the grappling hoook. Unbound weapons you unlock do not share ammo types with regular weapons so you have to throw them away to reload your weapon more often than not. Hand holding mechanics through out the entire game essentially.

gamepass versin of game will not run on my pc even with graphics settings set to everything low. Hve to play console cloud version.  Got off the ship and onto the ring in game pass pc version, and then the game just beame unplayable. Thought it was my computer, it is not. COmputer exceeds recommended specs. Installed steam version and game works fine with settings on medium. not surprising in the slightest since 100% of all games i've purchased via microsoft store have had to be repurchased on steam in order to play. At least my progress/unlocks carried over to steam. Quite literally, if they hadn't i'd give this game a 1
Story is pretty decent at least. Getting bored with dealing with the rings and the flood. Thought this franchise was expanding the scope of it's story to go outside that, but nope..back to rings..back to more flood. At some point, devs are just going to have to tell fans to keep quiet . What do people expect, it's the year 2100 and we are still exploring the adventures of Master Chief. Like seriuosly. Halo's lore shouldn't be exclusive to books and anime. The games shoudl explore all this extra stuff instead of just only focusing on 1 character for bleepin the last 20 years. Move on folks.
Please just kill off master chief permanently and move the story along..borrring."
Deckard2,"Jan 25, 2022",9,"6 long years since the dumpster fire that was Halo 5's main campaign. John 117 is officially back in what is arguably studio 343's finest piece of work.

Set after the events of Halo 5 and also after the void where perhaps there was once an idea for a Halo 6, the story picks up with the Chief comatose in space after a failed altercation with our new villains 'The Banished'. The story told here is a simple one, this is not to say poor, but most importantly decided to focus on the Chief and his emotional fall out from the events involving Cortana in Halo 4 & 5 as he attempts to stop 'The Banished' from achieving their evil plan.

The gameplay in this game feels refined and is very reminiscent of when I first picked up the Xbox controller years ago and stepped foot into combat evolved. The nostalgia here is indeed strong with this one. With the move sets on offer, this is the closest to letting you feel like a Spartan the games have ever achieved. The environments are rich in detail although sometimes a bit sparse with activity and the graphical detail is glorious and really sings in 4K.

A big part for any story driven game for me is the musical score. Gareth Coker really nails his composition and uses subtle Halo motifs to reinforce his original work. The result is a score that can move you and get your adrenaline pumping when the time is right. The rest of the sound design is also spectacular particularly when run through a 5.1 set up with an excellent mix of dialogue, music and sound effects with excellent spatial separation.

Disclaimer: I am a Halo nut. My only criticism with the game is that you essentially only inhabit 2 biomes throughout your 20 something hour journey. Although the gameplay always kept it feeling fresh as the loop was so addictive I did feel by the end game I would have liked to have seen a little variety in the locations throughout the game. Hopefully these will be used in whatever Halo Infinite will become as it is my impression that this is the platform for the future of Halo.

Overall, this is a masterpiece. Was it worth the wait? A resounding yes. Although location variety an issue throughout the main campaign I spent my entire time eager to jump back in and progress with finishing the fight. Welcome back Master Chief, you have been missed."

Multiplayer is extremely addictive
Performance was really solid throughout

Switching between weapons UI is cumbersome
Open World lacks visual diversity
Some small tech problems like pop in"
FatBrando,"Jan 24, 2022",9,"Reviewed on Series X. Halo Infinite is a great game with rough edges (a lot of rough edges) that is ultimately held up by incredible gameplay that’s just insanely fun to play.

The gameplay is what really saves this game. The addition of the grappling hook, which adds a slew of new tactical options in combat, as well as movement capabilities, is super fun to use. It’s great in the campaign and a fantastic addition to the multiplayer which has a renewed emphasis on equipment. The weapons are fantastic, the game is fast, fun and just overwhelmingly entertaining.

That being said…

Infinite is unpolished. The open world appears beautiful at first glance. However, spending time here begins to reveal rough edges. Geometry is at times so basic it looks like triangles. Grass floats in mid air over the edges of the ground. There is texture and object pop-in, a problem that is exponentially worse when flying a banshee or hornet. Shadows and light flicker unrealistically. There are frame rate drops and in general the whole thing suffers from a lack of optimization. It doesn’t distract from the excellent gameplay, but it certainly hurts immersion. You’re constantly reminded this is a video game and that hampers the experience.

To avoid spoilers I won’t go into it, but it’s just a very generic story. However, it’s told much more competently than Halo 5’s plot. Which, in my opinion, was more interesting, but delivered in a very boring way. There are good beats between Chief and new Cortana, well performed by Steve Downs and Jen Taylor. These moments are far more interesting and impactful than the Banished plot. The story is just underwhelming. With cutscenes playing out in a very formulaic fashion. And there is a general lack of variety in the game. You’re either outside in a giant version of the second level from the first game, or inside the ring, running through identical shiny blue metal corridors. No snow. No desert. No beaches. No swamps. It’s all rather repetitive.

On the multiplayer side of things the game suffers from a lack of content, and some bad decisions regarding progression, unlocks, and customization. Don’t get me started on micro-transactions. The prices in the store are a joke. They’ve made some changes but they’ve got a long way to go. ($7 for a Ace playing card to stick on my helmet? Seriously? It’s insulting. And they still want you to pay for basic colors like red, blue, etc.) But we mustn't blame 343, these are likely big daddy Microsoft decisions. And it does sound like they’re listening to community feedback so fingers crossed.

So. Why the 9? Sounds like I’ve got a lot of issues with the game. I DO. But, ITS DAMN GOOD FUN TO PLAY. I can’t argue with others who’ve scored the game lower, but at the end of the day, I play a game for fun. And this is the most fun I’ve had with a shooter in years. Every time I turn the game on I end up having a blast and I’ve got a smile on my face the whole time. I really hope they continue to give the game the polish it deserves. Despite it’s flaws, this is a must play and one of the best games on any platform. 9/10"

Viktoropitek,"Jan 22, 2022",5,"Это лишь субъективное мнение. Странное чувство, с одной стороны : унылая компания, без сюжета, с пустым , маленьким ( может так кажется из-за его унылости?) , Открытым миром . Закос под Ubisoft(хорошо, что хоть  этих однотипных задач не 9999999999) с кучей убогих активностей. Графика убогая ( наверное подобную картинку можно увидеть в играх пятилетней давности и больше (субъективное мнение) ), ничего нового, а скорее даже деградация какая-то, лучше б был коридорный , но с интересным сюжетом , шутер, чем просто карта на каторгой надо убить 5-7 боссов ( или сколько их там).
С другой стороны: отличный мультиплеер, крутые бои( по боям тоже самое и в одиночной игре, ТК ИИ на уровне) За одиночную компанию ставлю 3/10, за мультиплеер 8/10 и -1 балл за отсутствие русской локализации ( живу в США, проблем с английским нету, но все равно обидно , что соотечественникам приходится читать субтитры)
А самое убогое в этой ситуации то, что такая игра реально лучший шутер за последнее время и наверное по заслугам является одной из лучших игр последнего года - на столько все плохо стало с играми . Отстой."
Invisible_Mango,"Jan 22, 2022",0,"Unfinished buggy mess, but even if it was finished, this is the emptiest most pointless and tacked on open world I’ve ever seen.

Nubbo,"Jan 21, 2022",10,"Even with a small fraction of Halo’s original gameplay loop, it manages to knock the gaming landscape out of the park, and receive universal praise. Despite its evident lack of content, i can only imagine how grand the game  becomes in years to come."

Chutup,"Jan 19, 2022",0,The battle pass business model where I have to pay money and not get the skin I want but rather have to spend a thousand hours in game to unlock it AFTER paying money for it is most dystopian bullcrap I have ever heard of. I don't care if it's free to play. If I put money down I should get a good or service in return no strings attached. Not after I go into indentured servitude inflating the player base will I get the item I paid for. The developer has figured out a way to keep a player base up for share holder appeasement without putting more effort in making the game fun and it shows a hundred percent. There is nothing new to this Halo. In fact it feels very bare bones. It doesn't even feel like a halo game anymore. It plays like a copy and paste job of call of duty. From the maps and modes down to the battle pass system this game is just a boring generic cash grab now. It's free for a reason. Because the game has no value whatsoever.
Satanski666,"Jan 19, 2022",5,"Pros:

ChillJohnHill,"Jan 18, 2022",2,"This is a pretty bad shooter. The movement is too fast for how small the 5v5 maps are, every gun feels underpowered except for the tedious AR, the sniper ****, the vehicles are both clunky and overpowered somehow. The cosmetics are a mess and lazy while still being ugly. Capture the flag/odd ball is unplayable with randoms because you can’t 1 hit kill while carrying the flag so you’re basically dead as soon as you pick it up. There aren’t enough maps. Big team battle is just hoping that there isn’t a 1v5 against you when you’re pushing the objective (usually alone, because theres zero incentive game wise to push objectives). The progression system makes zero sense and it takes forever to get through, and the whole time you wonder why the next level takes this long. If this game wasn’t free people would be saying (correctly) that this is the worst halo of all time (including halo 5!!!)!"
Beereal20,"Jan 17, 2022",10,The best open world shooter ever made... The story is great with enough mystery to make you wanna play again and want the additional content that's coming down the line...

Jakedoe,"Jan 17, 2022",6,"Controversial opinion but the campaign had no business being open world, you could play every mission in sequence and not miss anything worth much.
You pay full price for a game that will charge you for a battle pass for any cosmetics.... halo reach at least had a lot more for absolutely nothing... times change but there's literally like 8 helmets to unlock and maybe 2 free ones outside events.
It's broken in multi for pc especially.... it's a great game if you can overlook the bugs, the absolutely overpriced cosmetics and the 100 dollar price tag for a really mediocre campaign that doesn't even give you the battlepass if you bought it... hate to see it, just hope they improve this early access halo."
JMorvid,"Jan 16, 2022",10,"Very good game for my part, quite entertaining with secondary tools that make combat more dynamic, scenarios where it made me feel like I was in the first titles of this beautiful saga.

HopeXime,"Jan 15, 2022",4,"The most boring open world i can think of. Everything is the same over and over. There's only one biome: forest. There’s nothing to explore other than worthless upgrades than you won’t need unless you play LASO or cosmetic skins for the multiplayer.

The campaign is dull. I can’t even think of a memorable moment. How about you take all the lore in the franchise and put in the dumpster behind the scenes. Atriox, cortana, the infinity, all gone and you get nothing. You just fight john doe and his crew of no names. Really? Curse you 343.

God forsake the gun play is fine and the worthless guns of the multiplayer are buffed as **** ( ravager, plasma rifle ). But the biggest mvp is the grappling hook. If it wasn’t for it, the game would be utter trash and a 0/10.

Really 343, every game you surpass yourself, doing the history worse and worse. If you are going to charge for a dlc of the campaign: seriously i hope you go broke."

DoctorLasagne,"Jan 14, 2022",9,"Campaign is very solid. You're getting a good story with great moments, dialogue, characters, boss fights, and an excellent open world setting to go with it. To put it simply, the game feels and plays like a Halo game. The story starts very strong, but it tends to get a bit repetitive about 2 to 3 hours in. However, it then picks up quickly and gives a strong finish. Overall, 8.5/10.

The multiplayer side is excellent, and where I believe that the game really shines. Gameplay is smooth and appropriately paced, the sandbox is fun to experiment with, and the maps are excellent. It is definitely new and refreshing, and once again there is a ton to experiment with. However, the game is still missing much content. Forge, greater variety of game modes, and more maps, to name a few. The lack of a progression system aside from the battle pass really hurts the multiplayer. There isn't enough incentive to come back to play, as much of the customization comes from the store, which has really high prices for items at the moment. Overall, while missing some pieces, the multiplayer is a lot of fun but relies heavily on the gameplay at the moment. Overall, 8.5/10.

Overall, it's an 8.5/10 in its current state. Campaign is solid, and while the multiplayer truly is a lot of fun, the lack of content really hurts it. I gave it a 9 over the 8 because I think that the game is a lot better than what we're seeing, but bottom line is that it's not a finished product yet and that's what hurts it."

- played on GamerPC and XboxOneS:
++ good: the proven Halo gameplay + the good music + beautiful views
++ good: OpenWorldGameplay offers many hours of play (20-40h)
-- bad ... OpenWorldMissis are too uniform in the sum: needs urgently more linear levels with ScriptAction like Halo3-5
++ linear sections with a lot of atmosphere like e.g. the ""Silent Auditorium"" BUT PLEASE more such levels with a view, gladly a 2D background like Halo3/Reach
-- action-rich /scripted levels are missing (see above), the epicness of earlier Halo parts is very rarely reached
-+ Graphics are quite good, great view, but due to dynamic resolution either too sharp and angular or blurry (depending on the blur setting in the graphics menu), actually looks a little better on Xbox-One-S then on PC. Graphics are about on the level of/ as good as FarCry6"

l4jv,"Jan 13, 2022",9,"Yo siendo un nuevo jugador de halo puedo decir que es un muy buen juego, la campaña está muy bien se nota que lo hicieron con esfuerzo, aunque debo decir que la manera en la que está contada la historia para jugadores nuevos no es la mejor si no sabes el contexto, pero se llega a entender.

El multijugador es gratis, sin necesidad de GOLD ni de comprar el juego, y la verdad vale mucho la pena, más si lo acompañas con amigos."
EasyGamerBoi,"Jan 13, 2022",9,"Took me long enough. Life stuff happens but WOW. This game is simply amazing. I can’t speak for the multiplayer portion but the campaign reignited a love for Halo that I haven’t felt since the Bungie games. It’s so good that I was actually sad when the achievement popped up for beating the game! And I actually want to complete things on a big open world map for once! How did 343 pull something this stellar off? As usual let me start with some negatives first, there aren’t many. During cutscenes sometimes the framerate would TANK, there was one instance when the game was chugging so badly I thought I was playing Halo on the Switch! These issues can be ironed out in a patch but not so much the story based ones unless there’s story DLC. I played & replayed the ENTIRE numbered Halo games a few months ago & I still felt kind of lost in places during Infinite’s campaign. I’m not well versed in things outside of the core series like comics or movies but it’s annoying when games do that nowadays. But in the same breath I also like reading up on buckets of lore after I finish a game so I can’t be too annoyed by it I guess, I just wish there was more info in the game itself. The end of Halo 5, for as average **** it was, set up some VERY interesting events that would happen in Halo Infinite but instead, we skip almost all of what it set up to the aftermath without many refreshers on what actually happened in between 5 & Infinite. I didn’t play Halo Wars 2 yet either but I know the general story of it, but I don’t think that would’ve helped much aside from more knowledge on the Banished. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVED uncovering the secrets of Infinite’s campaign & had a ton of fun with it beginning to end, I just wish the story didn’t leave me with more questions than answers & had a decisive finish, for this being the 3rd in 343’s trilogy and all. I loved pretty much everything else about Infinite though, the soundtrack is pretty damn good, it’s a Halo game after all. The world of Zeta Halo is beautiful & every weapon feels distinct & fun to use even if I only stuck to a couple of my faves by the end. My favorite thing by a MILE is the new grappling hook, why wasn’t this thing there from the very beginning of Halo?! It adds so much to the gameplay that I firmly believe any FPS should be required by law to have it implemented into their games, that’s how good it feels to use! I dare say it’s better than Doom Eternal’s! It’s so fun to use that I never used any of the other abilities that were given to me aside from once or twice. Climbing up a mountain and slingshotting yourself over it to smash Banished on the other side never got old. It doesn’t help that I just replayed Spider-Man on the PS5, so now Chief can go web to grappling hook with him lol. Overall, fantastic game. Exceeded my expectations despite some story hiccups that I hope are tied up in future DLC that I would gladly buy & play. It’s so good that I have the urge to 100% it, which is VERY rare nowadays for me. 343 has finally delivered!!"

Commun,"Jan 12, 2022",5,"I put a 5 because it's Halo.

-Cons:
Too much repetitive, no climatology changes,"
JukeaWall,"Jan 12, 2022",9,"The gameplay loop and moment to moment combat is some of the best the series has ever had, rivaling CE in terms of fairness and 3 in terms of bombastic nature and flair. The bosses are genuinely well done, fair, and interesting; a far cry from the embarassment of Halo 2's attempts. The story is a little lackluster in some aspects, I won't spoil anything but I saw major story beats coming hours beforehand. This does not detract from some of the best gameplay Halo has seen ever. The multiplayer is spectacular in gameplay terms. The sandbox is very well balanced (mostly) and each weapon feels unique, with skill ceilings being sky high but the floor being easy enough where most people can pick it up and play as well.

One thing I never see represented is how amazing the voice acting is in this game. Veterans of Halo will know how the series has always had a good sense of humor and spectacular voice acting but Infinite knocks it out of the park, having my overall favorite villain in the series save for Tartarus, and some of my favorite one-liners. The grunts steal the show every time one of them screams or says something funny. Joseph Staten seems to have blown his vocal chords out on some of those screams.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend picking the campaign up for $60, I'd recommend getting gamepass and playing it there as the campaign itself only takes about 8-12 hours to beat and even a single month of gamepass should let you experience most of if not all of the campaign, and the multiplayer is free. As a veteran of the series, this game is the breath of fresh air I've been waiting for since 2007 and is the first almost universally welcome edition to the franchise seen since Halo 3: ODST. Do yourself a favor and give it a try."

baskeva,"Jan 8, 2022",10,"This game is an apology letter from 343 for past games. The campaign blows expectations out of the water and does an amazing job of implementing new mechanics and story arcs while still paying homage to previous halo games. It has something for everyone. Instead of focusing on continuing a story for the sake of the story, the game tells an incredible story that doesn't require any additional information while still encouraging people to look up the outside lore. Hearing the original halo music at certain points literally almost brought me to tears.
In my opinion, I think the multiplayer is perfect. A lot of people criticize the customization and shop for having items that are too expensive, or for having separate armor cores, but I actually disagree with this. I think it is cool that I can have at least 2 different armor cores that I can change to my liking. And, even if I didn't disagree, 343 has done an AMAZING job of listening to feedback and giving players what they ask for, which I think is incredible. For example, they are now releasing most of the items to fit with all of the armor cores.
The multiplayer sandbox is so fun, and I can't get enough of it. I expect I will be playing this game for a very long time."

triple_co,"Jan 8, 2022",8,"Halo Infinite provides excellent old-school combat, with fun and balanced weapon options, as well as likeable characters, enemies, and villains. On the whole it's a great experience that has me hooked, particularly as far as the multiplayer is concerned.

I think it's clear from a full playthrough that 343 intended to put a lot more into the game before things were cut and rushed, however. The lack of variety in biomes or new foes as you progress through the campaign suggests that things were severely dialled back during crunch time.

The ending missions are particularly padded out and the amount of 'telling' rather than 'showing' in the narritive leaves it feeling a little empty. There are also a few issues with the monetisation and progression systems, and a lack of forge and modes.

Overall, though, the gameplay itself is fantastic, and has achieved the cleansing reboot feeling we all needed. Well worth a play!"
Dafaaa,"Jan 8, 2022",10,"Este es el Halo a jugar, si te decepciono Halo 4 y 5, si amas los clásicos, si amaste el 4 y el 5 o odiabas los clásicos, cualquiera que sea el caso, este juego es para todos, lo que halo 4 y 5 hicieron bien, lo mejora, lo que los clásicos hicieron bien, lo trae de vuelta y lo mejora y deja atrás todas las cosas malas que tenia cada juego.

La campaña es extraordinaria, es un mundo semi abierto, lo cual significa que te puedes dedicar a hacer las misiones principales (las cuales tienen una modalidad más lineal) en cualquier momento o dedicarte a mejorar tu habilidad y a el jefe maestro al conseguir las mejoras del mundo abierto, gracias a el gancho y los vehículos puedes explorar el mundo como quieras y de la forma que quieras.

El multijugador en el día 1 era algo repetitivo pero con su actualización, esta a un paso de tener un excelente multijugador. si muchas cosas de apariencia son de paga, pero al ser completamente gratis el multijugador, no se puede esperar menos.

Halo infinite no es perfecto pero sus defectos son tan pequeños que son fáciles de arreglar en una futura actualización y/o no los notas.

Smurps,"Jan 8, 2022",6,"If you enjoyed the gameplay from previous Halo games then you'll have a good time here, gunplay mixed with the grappling hook is a lot of fun.

However, you can tell this game was rushed. It's let down by a poor story, a lack of cutscenes or interesting characters, terrible friendly AI and repetitive areas and missions. Overall the lack of variety made the game feel very hollow, and it's odd that even little features that were present in previous games didn't make the cut here. I dread to think what the game would've been like if they had gone ahead with the massive map they'd initially intended."

Phoenix123,"Jan 7, 2022",10,"Halo Infinite is easily the best Halo game since Halo Reach and one of the best the franchise has to offer. The Master Chief continues to develop further as a character behind the armor, and new characters worked greatly in this campaign, proving to nearly all be very interesting characters. The Banished might be the best faction Halo has introduced yet, maybe a hot take but I think they might get there eventually. The multiplayer feels like the most fun I've had on a Halo multiplayer in decades. The core gameplay is absolutely fantastic. Obviously, the shop can be fixed and a few more game modes need to be added, but 343 has already stated they are working on both of these. The game is already very good, give it another month or two and this game should very well be a titan of the Halo franchise. This is exactly what Halo needed after Halo 5. Halo is back, and this is an amazing new step for the franchise."

Nerevarinho,"Jan 7, 2022",3,"I am talking as a Halo veteran, which also completed Halo 1 on Xbox 1 on legendary in solo mode.
Cheap gunplay. Cheap mission design. You are forced to kill all enemies in an area in order to press a button for progression. There was a back tracking fetch task just to have time to listen to a boring audiolog. Bad checkpoints. Bullet sponge boss has health bars as if the game was a loot shooter.
Halo 1 on Xbox 1 had more fluid respawn behavior, here you have a loading screen in between. You even have a loading screen between the underground to the open world area. Remember Halo 1 on Xbox 1? The loading times there were smooth and only a fraction of a second. Dual-weaponing is missing here. Aim assist is too invasive.
Cheap animations on gameplay. Guys try this, look down to see your boots, and turn left and right and look at the lowerbody being detached from the upper body. Cheap movement animation, as if you would glide. Running does not make you much faster and adds weird lines for a pseudo speed feeling, which also often point to the wrong direction. Flying ships seem to follow invisible rails instead of levitating.
Cortana replacement is trying to be funny and trying to show some sort of feeling, which does not fit into her role. I've just reached the open world surface an forced me through some mobs, and when I think of having to go through a Ubisoft kind of gameplay, and after I saw the game quality already, I can only say no thanks, I dont have the time for this outdated and unpolished gameplay.
Cutscenes were good until now, but the gameplay is just a massive downgrade even compared to Halo 1. Halo triology from Bungie remains the best."
countyourmacros,"Jan 7, 2022",5,"This has absolutely no business being an 8.5/10 and is clearly boosted by Halo fanboys and paid ratings.

The open world setting is forced and tedious. It can be fun at times but it artificially extends the hours played. The way you need to find audio logs for story is annoying, but not quite as bad as Destiny.

My gripe is the last quarter of the game. Two back to back boss fights, one so poorly hidden I (and many others) thought the game was glitched. To trigger one of the last 3 boss fights you need to activate a VERY easy to miss hologram which is the size of a quarter on the ground. That boss fight is yet another invisible enemy which is NOT FUN. There is nothing fun about fighting an enemy you literally cannot see. Then the second last boss fight is annoying and tedious. All the bosses are bullet sponges with no original mechanics.

What gives with the random area defence at the end? It makes no sense and is completely forced. Why are we armed to the teeth by our enemies but some of the brutes have no weapons? And why are the brutes without weapons harder to kill than brutes with weapons?

Why are snipers so deadly and so easily able to get off accurate shots so fast? I'm on normal and can get sniped instantly.

Also what gives with the frequent Hunter enemies? These are easily some of the most annoying enemies in the game series. In the OG Halo games they were very infrequent and designed as mini boss fights but there are too many of them in this game.

So many of the weapons are underpowered as well and burn through ammo like nothing. Many of the weapons aren't even worth using.

This is easily one of the worst gameplay options in the series. I've never rage quit so many times during campaign. I'm playing easy because I want the story, not because I want to die 450 times per mission.

Multiplayer admittedly is good, but campaign is awful and so broken up that the story is dumb and makes no sense. I defended the last entry but wow this was bad. Not a console seller."
snakelqi,"Jan 7, 2022",10,"Halo Infinite es para mi el mejor Halo después de halo 3, este es el juego que los fans veteranos y las nuevas generaciones estaban esperando, Halo infinite toma inspiración en el gameplay de la trilogía original, lo combina con un gunplay moderno de acuerdo a los FPS actuales y lo adereza con un sistema de mundo abierto, que te invita a explorar, sin perder la narrativa y ""linealidad"" de Halo clásico. A nivel técnico sin llegar a ser un juego sobresaliente, ofrece buenos gráficos con un desempeño con mas que excelente. El apartado sonoro también es un bueno y te hará sumergirte en la batalla. Lo que más me gustó de este Halo es que se siente vuelve a sus raíces dándole una vuelta de tuerca a la formula con adición del mundo abierto, del gancho y otros artefactos, sin mencionar que se recupera ese aire de misticismo que rodea el lore de la saga. La historia sin ser nada del otro mundo si aporta al desarrollo de este universo, se siente intrigante, creíble y relevante, ya estoy ansioso por saber como continuaran las aventuras de John 117, es un juego que recomiendo mucho tanto a veteranos de la saga como a novatos. Consejo final, juéguenlo en dificultad heroica desde el comienzo lo van a disfrutar más."
twztid13,"Jan 7, 2022",9,"Very fun, it definitely brings back the Bungie Halo feel, but with it's own personality. The gunplay is great. The mission structure is unique for the series, but i like it. The boss battles are great, and the graphics are decent (much better than what was shown at e3 2020). A very good, cohesive package. I don't care about multiplayer, but that's good also, so there's that (i think it should have it's own separate review section. That will probably never happen, though, sadly). >
>(It won't save paragraphs?)

Edit: this site is so horrible on mobile, u can't see what you're typing past,the 1st paragraph. People need to wise up. If u spent $60 on this game, u aren't all there, especially if u didn't like it. U could buy a 1 month trial to gamepass for $1 & beat it within 1 month. At WORST, u could pay $15 for 1 month to beat it. Why would u ever spend $60 on a 1st party game from MS, when they all come with gamepass? Anyone who includes the game costing $60 in their negative reviews...well, u can probably see through that. I don't expect everyone to enjoy the same games i do, but to dishonestly try to hurt a game like this, for whatever reason, is sad."
Emanuele192,"Jan 7, 2022",5,"for me it's 5/10, just because I like halo games in general. I've played for about 8 hours the multiplayer and it seems good but there isn't an anti-cheat, how can you release a game in 2021/2022 without an anticheat? I can't describe the campaign just because it's the 2nd time I reinstall the game and after the first cutscene I only see the hud of the suit and I can't do anything. The game is also poorly optimised and the servers are laggy even if I have 40ms on frankfurt (from italy)."

Bartantm,"Jan 6, 2022",5,The game was extremely fun at its first release but after a couple months of it being out the game has had practically 0 updates (the only one adding a game mode that should’ve existed on release) it’s a really disappointing repetitive multiplayer experience that is put together by bandaids It’s also filled with hackers (thanks free to play!!)

Allissei,"Jan 5, 2022",6,"Everyone applauds that it looks incredible, that the campaign is incredible, that the multiplayer is incredible.
It looks like nobody has taken a closer look!
They don't describe the game in depth ... the game is very good yes ... but it has big problems that people don't mention!

The campaign is very entertaining, but it has other problems, it becomes very repetitive, we do not have different biomes, we cannot select the missions, and we can't change the difficulty before starting a mission since everything is connected. No coop of course. (Right now isn't here)

The art style and the story are good! But also the campaign also feels like there's a lot missing, and you need to listen to audio logs...   the audio logs are good idea, but a better idea could had been to play those moments instead of only listening to them.

And now MULTIPLAYER...   It's okay...   but it's usually really bad because of balancing issues, questionable decisions and cheating.
Melee is broken (somethimes it works, sometimes let's you punch someone that isn't close to you), some weapons are too good and other are too weak, then the MAPS, most of them are bad  when we talk about close quarters, always somebody can flank you in any small map.
The enemy sensor is almos useless, since you can sprint, graple, use the thruster and attack you from far with the broken melee  and some close quarters weapons that can be used at mid range...    so almost always you can get jumped and get suprised.
Now finally the progression and monetary stuff is still bad...   it was worse, but they made it a bit better.
I mean I can carry on with so much stuff, but I'll leave it here.

I'm also running into some server connection problems...   and it's not about my internet or the console. (because this happens also to the people that I play with)

And I feel generous with a 6 but all the negatives that could be fixed so easily makes me not give it a 7 or 8...    I played Halo since the original Xbox, so I know what I talk about, since I played ALL Halos in all difficulties, and all multiplayers!

Hadouken_117,"Jan 4, 2022",10,"The best game I’ve played for the year 2021
The best aspect of this game is gameplay, so addictive and fun. Music is way better the Halo 4,5 and halo wars 2 but not is good as the original.
The story is better than odst in my opinion and way better than 5 but not as good as Halo 2,3 or reach.

Mallugado,"Jan 4, 2022",10,Solid story and in general a pretty good game with a sandbox that can get bigger and bigger with updates
TheOracleYT,"Jan 4, 2022",3,So this is a halo game that has a super fun premise as it started off good.. but fell flat at the end. It’s story where It ended on a obvious sequel bait to another future halo where it really should’ve ended at 3 or better yet.. get better writers to create a more fulfilling story.. The open world got seriously repetitive after awhile with just rocks and trees everywhere and endless steel hallways which makes me think it should’ve had a another delay of a year or two.. at least I had fun grappling everywhere like Spider-Chief and throwing bomb crates on the covenant reskins
Bad_Reviewer,"Jan 4, 2022",9,"We finally have a Halo game that feels like Halo. The story is great and the sandbox is fun but, the micro-transactions are egregious. If the game has the in-game shop prices lowered I would give this a ten. Good job 343."

HamiltonJarvis,"Jan 3, 2022",9,"Halo Infinite tries going back to their roots and adding some new mixtures to the formula and from the get go, i was having fun with Halo.

The gamplay loop feels really good and all the new abilities ties in very nicely with combat.

Once you get to the explorable part of the ring, most of it gave me throwback memories of the second mission i Halo CE. you find and rescue marines, battle along side them and take objevtives. That feeling of exploring a ring world with new mysteries is quite profound in Infinte.

Graphics are serviceable and looks decent, NOT next gen but look fine overall.

The storytelling and story in general isnt bad but i do think 343 dont do a terrific job of explaining who some the charcaters are and what theyre significance are in the Halo lore. My two main gripes with the story are Atriox (only in the beginning) and the fall of the UNSC infinity.

The banter between the ""weapon"" and Chief is EXCELLENT and the memory cutscenes of cortana and others are really good and provide alliot of context to what is going on and why.

Campaign may feel short and doesnet really have any setpiece battles but this game in general is step in the right direction over Halo 5 and if 343 can emphasize the gameplay into bigger and bolder battles, the sky is the limit.

NEGATIVE: No Co-op or firefight mode on launch....."

the vehicle handling is not that good, is like paper

Store ****, but hey is F2P

about the campaign. is enjoyable but the open world is sometimes the same chore, save marines, capture point A-B repeat and sometimes the exploration is just walking around a desert land.

Main campaign is alrigth but could have some improvements in lore/story standars.

no flood :(

needs scarabs for the vast battlefield which was a missed opportunity

some weapons are straigth useless on multiplayer but every weapon is usable on campaign

still, the enviorment is fun and grapple hook is amazing, i wish there were more stuff on the open world, but hopes for dlcs.

good game and enjoyable multiplayer so far"
tdebug,"Jan 2, 2022",3,"Open world looks beautiful, but that's about it. Combat is totally unengaging and enemies AI is very primitive, as they behave like multiplayer bots in Quake from 90s, sometimes know how to use cover, but mainly strafing around you. Allies AI is also very dumb - marines which supposed to follow you are jumping like gummy bears, but stuck anyway on nearly flat surface and stop following you. Once I even pushed them one by one from a small cliff, to help them pass, but they stuck again soon enough. They could have spent another year in development easy.
Overall very, very repetitive gameplay."

The core gameplay is AMAZING but the lack of content and the insanely greedy monetization truly bring this game down. Hopefully as a live service game it’ll get better with updates. I know Forge and campaign co-op is around the corner, so we can look forward to that.

It’s great to see the real masterchief back again after the failed Halo 5 experiment. The open world it’s the logical evolution to the saga, and it really fits perfectly here. For me, halo infinite it’s for halo saga the equivalent of breath of the wild for Zelda saga.

Please try another profession because if this is the only games you’ve put out, and they’re all trash. Bungie needs to make them again if they want any relevance to the big boy like cod.

It is an amazing entry in the franchise and a great place to build off of."
Jugglernaut,"Jan 1, 2022",6,"As a long time Halo fan (since 2002), i'm disappointed. Halo Infinites campaign is lacking creativity and vision, two things that made the original Halo games so outstanding. Halo Infinite's open world feels lackluster, kind of empty. In linear Halo games the action was more dense, the creators created worlds and coherent experiences within the campaign, each level was different from the other (ok, not always) and you constantly wondered about what might come next. But here you have already seen everything a few seconds after you enter the open world. There is only one biome (with only ONE single tree design) and no interesting locations to go to.
The story is almost only told via dialogues between ""the weapon"" and masterchief and some ""voices"" from cortana. There is nothing really exciting going on, you only walk through the same looking (but still beautiful designed) locations over and over again while the „the weapon“ or Cortana are talking, that's basically it. Even Halo Combat Evolved - with its repetitive misson design in some levels - had way more variety than Infinite.
I'm not sure what to think about the open world. Sure it's fun to wonder around and explore hidden items, but it gets stale quick when you realise there is not much to it.
This game relies way too much on its gameplay. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is fantastic, its the typical high quality Halo gameplay we all love, but as much as i love mac and cheese, i don't want to eat it always and every day, i need some variety. Halo Infinite missed the chance to introduce new enemies (the skimmers don't count, they resemble the old drones way too much), whole enemy races and even new vehicles. We fought grunts, elites, jackals and brutes for almost 20 years now, and as much as i still like to fight them, it gets old only doing that throughout the whole game without any alternation. Maybe 343 got cautious after they realised the prometheans weren't that popular. But that should not mean not to try again, not to try something else. There are so many great enemy designs out there.
No Coop is also very, very disappointing. I think the open world design is to blame here. The creators couldn't figure out how to implement coop here.
The multiplayer is fun but lacks in maps and game modes. Also i'm not a big fan of the battlepass, i hated that  system already in games like Rocket League. The shop prices in Infinite are ridiculous and i won't spend a single cent as long as they remain that high, not much more to say about that.
Oh, and please fix Big Team Battle! It's almost impossible to get into a game with more than 4 players in your team because the servers can't handle it.
All in all, in this current state i give Halo Infinite 6 out of 10. Sadly, a huge opportunity wasted. My hope is that this game gets better with time, but i wouldn't bet on it."

R3demption,"Dec 31, 2021",0,"Honestly, I felt like the story hit a high note from recent memory in the Halo games. I haven't felt this excited and in love with the Halo single player since Halo 3. I can count multiple tear-jerk moments, as well as many where I was blown away. This was the first game in a long time where I simply could not put it down because I NEEDED to finish the story. There are a few things holding it back, mainly in some story or sequences that could have been included but felt left out or rushed. As for Multiplayer, it doesn't quite feel like the mostly complete experience we are used to from launch until today's date. As a long-time player in the Halo franchise I feel I am missing out on some game modes which I know will make their return soon or be rotated in. This is something I feel most Halo fans are used to over the life of the game, but it is still a little thin even by that standard. I think this is what holds the game back from a higher score than a 9. With all of that said, the game plays and feels amazing and is also a ton of fun for what we do have at the present."

guiletheguiles,"Dec 30, 2021",9,"I didn't think HALO Infinite would end up being one of my favorite games of 2021. The series had kinda died for me since HALO 4, but with this one, the future is bright for Master Chief once again.

If I could use one word to summarize Infinite, it would be FUN.
I've played this game for a bit over 15 hours and I felt nothing but joy from beginning to end. The gameplay is just peak HALO! From multiplayer to the campaign.
The environments are beautiful and feel great to explore, the level of verticality in the open world and interior stages is amazing, sidequests are fast paced and important to the main story, every gun is useful and impactful, multiplayer feels fresh... Everything just works and its execution is highly addicting. I almost 100% the map, even after finishing the story.

The reason why I think Infinite's gameplay loop works so well is due to its greatest addition. And no, it's not the new sandbox-style map. It's something simpler: the grappling hook.
Grappling hooks usually transforms the game and it wasn't different for HALO. It makes traversal fun and quick, opens new doors to improvise during combat, makes platforming a charm and it changes the game. It's so good that I didn't even care for the other equipments. In fact, changing equipments in this game is a hassle. I just stuck with the hook.

But the cracks in this near perfect HALO game starts to show up when the story becomes the focus.
Master Chief's new narrative is good. It's definitely a huge improvement over the 4th and 5th entries. The writing is good, the new Cortana is cool as hell, the Banished are threatening, Chief is better than ever and even Echo 216 gets to shine.
The problem is that it feels very incomplete. It's not well told at all. Most things happen before the game even start. Actually, almost every essential moment happens off-screen and even the cutscenes, while graphically impressive, feel a bit off. I also don't think it ties well with where 5 left off, which is absurd, since that game had universal-threats like the Guardians being thrown at you. And now they are gone. Just like that.

And as the story cracks are perceived, some of the bad leaks to the gameplay as well. Like how checkpoints happen at random. And how sometimes the challenge can be a bit too much. Or how driving any vehicle (except the Ghost) in this game is horrible. And then you notice that the final levels of the game, while still thrilling, can get very repetitive and sort of tedious.

But even after noticing these cracks, I also know that they're very small compared to how good this game is. This is the best HALO since 3. It pulled me back to a franchise that I absolutely love and that made me incredibly happy. This is definitely 343's finest work. Hell, they even made the boss fights remarkable and I don't think I can say that for past HALO games.

With a short and sweet open world, fantastic gameplay and an ok story, HALO's back, making this Microsoft's best exclusive game in years."
umutzzz,"Dec 30, 2021",10,"I have finished the campaign 3 times and played the multiplayer for like 20 hours. This game is really good, the story is good and does not feel repetitive and boring like alot of games unfortunately these days do. The mechanics are great and it plays smooth. The only thing that is a bit less are the graphics it does not feel next gen imo."
Nataraja,"Dec 30, 2021",8,"343 has managed to resurrect Halo to a status of respectability.  This is, in my opinion, a good game but not a masterpiece as it relates to the campaign.  The gunplay is solid, the grapple shot adds some great versatility and the open world is well executed.  The new Cortana/not Cortana can get irritating at times.  The combat starts to run out of interesting things to do and execute toward the end and feels very similar, including the fight with the Brute leaders with one shot hammers.  While I completed the game, I think it would be good to revisit the checkpoints, especially the final boss.  That would keep the game from overstaying it's welcome.  I know most people are here for the PvP but I play just the campaign.

I will say that I believe this was pulled out from the ashes single handedly by the leadership of Joseph Staten -  and who could have made Destiny amazing along with Marty O'Donnell, both of whom left ostensibly due to creative differences with other Bungie long time members.  I hope Joe continues to work with 343 and other Microsoft studios as his writing and direction is top notch.

I look forward to the next Halo.  Thankfully it seems to be headed in the right direction."

I gave nine points at the beginning, but the more I played, the more I will find that the game is a semi-finished product, and all kinds of mistakes in multiplayer mode are maddening"

Rincemac,"Dec 27, 2021",7,"Oh, Master Chief, the things you had to go through to arrive at this desolate ""Zeta"" Halo... they jettisoned you into Space (several times), just to be deep-frozen and then found again to be reactivated as the pinnacle of UNSC's forces, a shining beacon of hope for the troops thanks to your almost wordless performance as a human-formed tank, protecting the most sophisticated AI from falling into the enemy's grubby hands/claws/tentacles or whatever it is the manifold multi-racial gang-up on humanity are featuring in the limbs department.

The premise, once again, is a lone Master Chief floating in space, being picked up by an Antonio Banderas-type lone surviving the latest onslaught of the Aliens vs. Humanty UNSC pilot - who Master Chief will find out more about during the story, and again with the typical non-talking attitude most seem to love about the almost silent Hero of Halo. At the outset, it doesn't look too good for UNSC and the rest of Humanity. They seem devastated by the latest attack of the ""Banished"" on Earth and the defending forces.

With that premise, Master Chief and the lone pilot team up, unwillingly on the Pilot's side, to disover they're near a Halo Ring named ""ZETA"".

Of course, no Halo can begin without a huge Warship being brought done by Master Chief himself on his lonesome, so that's how we do it again, crashing on the Zeta Halo as a result.

On there, we find ourselves in an open-world type situation where Master Chief can roam freely after doing some initial missions, and then to discover that potentially a Rogue AI that he might know very well and which since their last meeting has kind of went insane is still around. Master Chief was originally tasked with ""deleting"" Cortana, said Rogue AI, but has catastrophically failed to do this at the end of the Halo 5 story arch.

Being provided with a new ""Set to Kill Cortana"" deletion routine, which miraculously looks like her target as a hologram (and has the same one-size-fits-all-AI voice acting) they set out on the lone and partially deactivated and destroyed Zeta Halo to find out what's going on.

Not only is the Halo on the brink of being active again - and that is never a good thing with Halo Rings, as the avid player should know - but it's also swarming with ""Banished"", a ragtag team-up of the Aliens who originally set out to to kill humanity for what seems like Religious reasons - always a great reason to start a war, really!

Is the open world any good? It depends on what you like about Halo. If you like killing all sorts of Aliens with different kinds of Weapons while roaming on a ""free"" scenario instead of following invisible tunnels while doing it? Then this is your kind of Halo!

Do you like teaming up with dumbass AI Marines you have to ""free"" from being captured by the Aliens strewn about the Halo Ring in different locations, and the more you free, the more will be roaming around, trying to help you reclaim the Halo and prevent it from being fired?

Well, I'm glad to say, this is your Halo!

If you, like me, however care about Weapon Balance, a semblance of a coherent story, smart AI colleagues that do not get frequently crushed by Warthogs you call in at various bases by running right below the area they're being dropped on to... I am sad to say you will not like that Halo experience. As that is exactly what you're getting.

A loosely clobbered together Halo on an open-world Setting that you can traverse within 5 Minutes or so on an aircraft - which you will unlock very late in the endgame to help you reach those far-out places where the legendary Skulls are hidding which help you unlock even more hardcore settings to make the game harder.

Talking about hard: the enemy AI is not that smart, but it's as usually balanced out by kicking things up a notch. I got the distinct feeling that the ""normal"" setting is the new ""hard"" in this iteration of Halo. And I finished all of them on Legendary difficulty.

Some of the patterns of attack just are there to annoy you and make the game frustrating, like the snipers being perched kind of everywhere, and with rifles that will disable your aircraft in mid-flight... not sure making a single player/coop game frustrating is the way to go, 343 Industries.

Oh, and a fair word of warning at the end:
There are small and bigger bugs aplenty in this one from the get-go and no patches in sight (December, 2021)... like ""Speed Lines"" options you disable but which don't stick and you have to disable them again and again when you restart...

If you're an old-school Halo player like me, you'll get your 10 hours of enjoyment out of it, but in my case I have to say: begrudgingly so!"

JiohJioh,"Dec 26, 2021",10,"Quiero ser muy sincero, desde el desastre con Halo 5 no sabía si el estudio de 343 nos tomarían en serio aunque no quiero hablar por todos, pero tras más de 100 horas jugadas, 80 de multijugador y más de 20 en campaña, digo que es la mejor que han realizado, no me sentía tan emocionado jugando una entrega desde el 2007 con Halo 3 que nos dio Bungie.
A nivel argumental es interesante, te atrapa, te mantiene al tanto de sus detalles y te deja con dudas, pero esas mismas te las responde con forme vas avanzando, puede tener sus errores sobre todo para los nuevos o los que nuca jugaron Halo Wars 2 respecto a los Desterrados en su introducción, aún así es hermoso como maneja la nueva trama que tiene Master Chief con Weapon como la relación que tienen con Cortana y él mismo sabe lo que es. Incluso por primera vez que te dejen a libertad moverte por cierta zona de Zeta Halo sin importar que completes objetivos secundarios mientras tienes las misiones principales de por medio es sublime, no se siente como un Far Cry donde a veces estabas obligado a completar ciertas misiones secundarias para seguir con la trama principal, incluso poder seguir jugando tras completar la historia para ver las hermosas vistas, conseguir registros de voz, núcleos Spartan o dar por finalizado todo lo pendiente, me parece un nuevo método ingenioso y muy bien elaborado para disfrutar el juego por más horas fuera del Multijugador.

A nivel muy personal y nostálgico puedo decir que es hermoso no tiene comparación con entregas posteriores de 343, lo disfrutas, te diviertes, tienes toda una gama de métodos para atacar enemigos desde patrullas, misiones secundarias y las partes de las misiones principales, te la pasas genial jugando y se siente como para volver a jugarlo desde 0 pero con mayor dificultad con o sin cráneos.

A nivel técnico me sorprendió bastante y mucho, no lo digo porque pueda estar roto o desbalanceado con algunas armas o tenga errores ya que en mi caso sólo una vez dejo de funcionar y se cerro, pero tan sólo en descarga tenga una valoración de 16-30 GB sin el multijugador, me llamo la atención con creces, ya que son 20 o más de esas 20 horas de juego incluyendo todo por explorar, el nivel de detalle que maneja es como para quedarse a observar los paisajes de Zeta Halo y escuchar su ambientación, el ver como pasan las 24 horas desde el anochecer hasta el amanecer es increíble, por ello siento que lograron su cometido de superar mis expectativas con un basto mapa con físicas, ambientación y belleza en tan solo 16-30 Gb.

Con esto quiero finalizar y decir que es completamente sublime, bello, hermoso e incomparable con Halo 4 y 5, hasta la fecha mi Halo favorito a la par de Halo 3."

noobula7,"Dec 25, 2021",8,"Halo Infinite is probably the most fun I've had in any multiplayer game for a while now. Most recent FPS games have come out fairly disappointing, but Infinite manages to spice up the FPS genre in a way that new and old fans of Halo will enjoy. In terms of multiplayer, the only thing that is holding it back, in my opinion, is it's introduction of a battle pass system. Every game as of late has implemented a battle pass system, and frankly I find it to be quite annoying, especially looking at how enjoyable unlocks were in Halo Reach. Other than that, there have been issues with Big Team Battle, which hopefully will be solved soon. Now for the campaign, I deeply enjoy the idea of Infinite being an open world game. However, it is filled with repetitive tropes spawning from games like Far Cry, where there are copy and pasted outposts. Yet, the gameplay is so addicting that I believe this game deserves a pass, and the introduction of an open word in Halo marks a bright future for Halo games, if they decide to continue pursuing open world."
DoctorMojica,"Dec 24, 2021",10,"HALO INFINITE improves in every way the HALO formula. Amazing graphics, uncanny soundtrack, an interesting and emotional story and the best fast paced action of the saga.

The best game I have played in the last years and the best game that I have played on my Xbox Series X yet. A MUST PLAY!"

Dom007,"Dec 24, 2021",9,"8.5/10 Overall a very fun game. The combat is great and the weapon variety is really good. Unlike in halo's 4 and 5 the enemies actually behave like halo enemies and the game is very polished with solid graphics and very few bugs. The open world is also very addictive with plenty of filler content. However despite the positives it is still a game with many problems and as a result the game feels like it could have been a lot better. First of all on higher difficulties the boss fights are awful. One hit kills on legendary, no way of dodging attacks and bullet sponge health bars all result in frustrating encounters. The environment variety is also not good enough. The interiors are all the same and the open world always looks the same. Not good enough for a halo title. The story whilst not as bad as halo 5's  insulting garbage story is very bare bones and only really picks up towards the end. The villains are disappointing and generally uninteresting as most of the time they only appear in holograms. The endless are massively underdevoped and not all that threatening either. The weapon and the pilot are decent characters but not exceptional. The cutscenes are also underwhelming. Some of the ones later in the game are quite good but they are generally lacking compared to the cutscenes in the bungie games or even halo 4 to some extent. The opening cutscene for example could have so great but it ended up being just average with an underwhelming fight scene and a massive  ship being blown up off screen which would have been awesome if actually shown to us. The music is definitely better than the last two halo games however most of the best tracks are remakes of older music from older games and for the most part the newer tracks in the game are fairly forgettable. It also annoys me that i cannot create large squads of marines because the ones you rescue never show up at the fob's and always despawn. The game also launched without co-op which is not good.
Overall the game feels and plays like a halo game and is far better than halo's 4 and 5. However it could have been so much better and infinite has a lot of problems that need to be addressed of changed in the upcoming DLC's/expansions."

DavidHawk2051,"Dec 23, 2021",8,"Strictly speaking about the campaign; Is this the best open world FPS game ever? No. Is it the best Halo ever? Yes, without a doubt.

Zeta Halo is a beautiful world with a culmination of vast open valleys and scenic vista and alien octagonal pillars emerging from the ground creating synthetic “mountains” and ancient alien architecture akin to the original halo games (think of the level HALO from the first game inflated to a point where it is it’s own game) all the while we see UNSC ships littered through out the ring showing clear signs of failure and the desecrating expanding industrial footprint the banished have constructed  // though the view is beautiful, there isn’t much any location on the map that sets it apart from other areas. It’s all cliff faces, fields, valleys, and lakes. I wish we had snow capped mountain, or geysers or something of the sorts to mix it up. “More Yellowstone less Yosemite” Not only does it lack in memorable areas, the size is not very large, it’s similar in scope of MGSV Phantom Pain Afghanistan map

The map is strangely devoid of wildlife. Yes you’ll see prairie dogs scurry and birds fly in flocks, but it would be more lively if we could see alien wildlife roaming in herds or grazing or stalking prey in the thicket; that would attack both the player and the banished.

The vast open world is littered with FOB outpost recovery, UNSC squad distress signals, and high valued targets needing to be eliminated. However don’t mistake these as side missions as they are not. No scripted events, cutscenes, or dialogues. Just a “kill and control” completing the campaign and these “kill and control” events leaves the game empty with very little to do.

Recovery of the FOBS allow requisite drops which are limited to Guns and Vehicles. Cool concept but annoying that, that is the only way to replenish items you need. I wish it was integrated in a way that you can call echo 216 to drop guns, vehicles, MARINES or even supporting fire from any location rather than just guns and vehicles in conquered FOBs. And to also add life to the game, have FOBs be under sieged by banished forces 3-5 times in “in game days” and failure to recover an FOB will result in some vehicles and guns not being able to be dropped until FOB is conquered. It adds a goal and stakes to an otherwise empty world.

But what lacks in depth and size it greatly makes up in combat and gameplay. Maintaining a stable 60 FPS and occasionally dropping to 90 FPS in this performance mode, halo has improved in its gameplay and feels the best to play then all the others in the past. It feels more like DESTINY and DOOM combined while maintaining that classic Halo formula. The only issue I have is that a lot of classic guns from Bungies halo and even 343 Halo are omitted. And the new guns now are awful to say the least. They lack in variety and distinction and are missing that uniqueness bungie and early 343 brought to the table.

Final verdict, there are other open world games that have done it so much better than Halo infinite. But that’s not to say that the game is bad. No not at all. There are very little few things that the game has in its current state that makes it “bad” but it’s more of the things that have been omitted that prevents its from being one of the best games of all time. A solid B grade"

iMustang,"Dec 23, 2021",9,"An absolute return to form in every sense of the word. In the most ambitious title they've ever made, Halo Infinite gives you a beautiful and vibrant open world to explore. Whether you want to play strictly the story or explore and find side missions to take on, this game is nonstop fun and is the first Halo game since 3 to recapture a feeling long lost. Both the single-player and multiplayer feel like the classic Halo formula but evolved into the next level, and the story quality is at it's finest giving me my both my favorite story and social experience since 3. This truly felt like a fresh start for the series by wrapping up all loose ends and laying the groundwork for the next phase of this universe, and if this is only the beginning of what they're capable of I can't wait to see where they go next. Also Chief's new AI made this whole game worth playing just because of how great she was."
Ariano,"Dec 23, 2021",10,"Haven’t played the previous games, don’t really know the entire Halo story but I can review this game. It’s an amazing game, one of the best FPS out there and the multiplayer is quite good too. One thing I should note is that they should’ve given some insight of the entire game story since many people will be entering this game using GamePass. Weapons, vehicles, the map, characters, story. Everything is top notch and looks like it was really given some thought to everything. It’s open world-ish (and I think Halo games should take steps in that direction since the Halo Universe has so much potencial for that), which gives us a great mix of main story and some side activities. This game is another gem from Microsoft from what’s a pretty bad year for gaming in general. To the development team, you have my gratitude. Keep up!"

Dakrkplayer2,"Dec 22, 2021",9,This is one the best HALO games I played for a long run. And since I now played both the MP and story. I say it very good one for years. And I can't wait for 343 bring out expansion updates to the story with more mission. Since this will last for the next ten years.  And while I was playing. I saw some glitches. But not game breaking most of the time. And I also have time to played this between XBOX SERIES X and XBOX ONE X. XBOX SERIES X blows XBOX ONE X in compared each other. And game breaking glitches tend be more the XBOX ONE side of things then XBOX SERIES X of things. And XBOX SERIES X is more sharper then the XBOX ONE X. And why more detail then XBOX ONE X. And the feature update with ray tracing. And added coop and forge next year. It only get better from here. And with all this and all. That why I give it a nine out of ten. Because of small cons. Also the multiplayer have some cons. But by the end of 1st qt of 2022. It will be solved beside the forge. So in layman trims. This is better then some $70 PS5 1st party game that has no plan to have expansion story to the game. And in the long trim will have more content then that said $70 PS5 party game. And any dumb SONY fan think I being paid by MICROSOFT. I am not. I like HALO. And if I did. US government will smile it and take away my SSI and medicade away from me. And I know someone that a SONY fan personally that in the same **** boat. If SONY paid him to say SONY is only thing should be allowed to played. The same **** gov will take his SSI and medicade too. So before you speak that part. remember that one your fellow fanboy would loss his. If SONY paid him to say good thing about SONY.
SorneUnknown,"Dec 22, 2021",7,"(The most realistic review that you will read.)  No spoilers.  First off, anyone who says ""I have been playing the series since the beginning"" and gave it a 10 has not been immersed in the series and is probably one of these newfound ""I get paid to up-tick games"" lot (and yes, that is now a thing).  I own all the games and have read 24 of the books that were written but mostly from the early years.  But before we touch on lore, let's talk about gameplay.  The best way to describe this game is Halo Arcade, not Halo infinite.  For one, they dumbed it down to give it a Teen rating.  That means no blood, no assassinations, but just a generalized arcade-spun experience which include a decent array of weapons but missing some of the iconic ones from series past.  Chief now sports a throw-back to Halo 3 mixed with the MC from the Forward Unto Dawn movie.  Personally, I thought they were trending in the right direction with the armor style from Halo 4 into 5 as it seemed more hardcore and militant which is what chief is.  They also washed it with a ""less aggressive"" green as opposed to the OD (or Army) green of suits past.  His gloves look like real leather gloves that are super tight but with designs on them.  Again, the older stuff looked more like real combat armor, or should I say an under suit (again they were going in the right direction when you saw the ending of Halo 4), and how the suit was configured with the plates and all.  He now looks more like he's getting ready for a junior-high Halloween contest.  He doesn't look more badass, he looks more arcade-like, like 343 is trying to make moms think he is less aggressive looking.  Now for the lore, which they apparently just threw out the window.  I know they want to make MC seem more vulnerable but they are forgetting one, huge, freaking thing.  This guy is an augmented, super experienced (the most actually of any UNSC soldier), hyper-reflexed combat machine.  Every move he makes is calculated and efficient, and in the opening cut scene he gets thrown around like a rag-doll by Atriox.  I mean, WHAT??!?!?!  Chief has beat the most elite chieftains, hunters, you name it, en masse, outnumbered, and still moves around the battlefield like a musician (sans Halo 5 where they tried to make Locke seem like he could go toe to toe with MC).  Now he makes smart-ass comments, like he's a teenager.  They also try to make him seem all confused about who he is and what he has done which is also annoying and 343 has been trying to do that for a while.  What most fail to understand is that he is a Spartan.  Look at Spartans from centuries past.  They were raised the same way and when they got into their later years, you couldn't tell them that they were broken or mentally flawed because that is what they were, all that they were.  So people should stop judging him in Halo and accept the fact that he is superior in training, combat ability, reflex, and prowess than any of those around them.  And what is the deal with knock-off Cortana.  Did 343 need an excuse to make her more like a 16 year old girl so that she is more appealing to the younger crowd?  (Face palm).  When other reviews on here say that they gameplay is dated, it's really just simplified so that younger kids can play it with it's Teen rating.  The grappling hook was probably the coolest feature but everything else was meh and the story was off the mark pretty bad.  This game almost smacks of when Bethesda tried to capitalize on Fallout with ""76"" and it fell flat.  Now, they send out a bunch of paid ""up-voters"" to blandly ""10"" the game so that people will buy it.  It ranks near the bottom in the series in terms of innovation, story, and mechanics.  It's just Halo Arcade."

switchboym,"Dec 22, 2021",9,"I am not a xbox fan boy, I am not a sony fan boy or even a nintendo fan boy, but thanks to gamepass ultimate, I manage to play this game on the cloud. I love how 343 decided to go for a different approach on how they make halo, and I am happy that they did not change the gameplay. When I played Halo 5 and Halo 4, I was super disappointed on how 343 changed up the gameplay and made halo basically CALL OF HALO. Infinite goes back to basics with the gameplay while adding a new built in feature in the campaign, that makes me feel like Spiderman in a super soldier suite. The grapple hook has helped me defeat in many points like when I am circled around by some grunts. Another thing that I like about the campaign is its characters. The weapon is my favorite character in the game because of how much she makes jokes but not to many jokes and how she makes fun of the enemies. One flaw that Halo Infinite suffers is its visuals, I was starting to get a bit bored of just seeing only grass forerunner objects rocks so I do wish in a DLC they bring back other maps like the snow area from combat evolved or a warthog run stage. Another small flaw is that the story, without spoilers but I did find the story in the second act a bit confusing to understand. But overall Halo Infinite is a great fps campaign and I do recommend if you are looking for a Halo game to start with. Like God of War and Spiderman ps4, Halo infinite amazed me with its world and characters and its weapons, I had a great time and 343 improves on some of the flaws on the campaign when the campaign co op releases. (this is my opinion and my thoughts)"
Aiglegarde79795,"Dec 22, 2021",9,"Overall Halo infinite is a great experience. The story mode is really good. But, I agree that the graphical part is a bit disapointing! Except that, the atmosphere, the gameplay, the story and the open world are amazing!

Knowbowl,"Dec 21, 2021",8,"Easily the best Halo campaign since Reach.

I'll get the negatives out of the way first. The open world, while well executed, will always force a game into certain corners. Some of the objectives, particularly the marine rescues, felt less creative than the others. Despite feeling very hand-crafted, the map is all a single biome, making each side of it look nearly identical. Despite being very diverse, there's only one enemy faction. I mention that as some of my favorite games in the series had missions with multiple enemy factions fighting against one another, creating uniquely dynamic scenarios. The linear level's designs could get a tad repetitive. Friendly AI felt less dynamic than in previous titles. Some ""we're all in this together"" type cutscenes felt out of place. Some disappointing narrative choices, though I won't spoil anything.

That being said, the positives outweigh the negatives heavily. The open world is very well executed. I found myself exploring nearly every inch of it looking for skulls and easter eggs. It simply screams ""Halo"". I played through it on a base Xbox One, and surprisingly enough it ran without a hitch. The visuals were scaled down as expected, but the framerate was consistent and I never felt like I was getting a lower-tier experience. The weapon variety is on-point, with some of the new ones feeling like staples in the franchise moving forward. The enemies are exciting to fight, with a special shoutout to the boss fights. The main missions provided the necessary linear elements of the game, and also provided a fairly captivating story. The grapple hook feels like it should've been there from the beginning, and makes for some of the best flowing gameplay in the series, that at the same time doesn't depart from the classically grounded Halo combat. The soundtrack is stellar as always, but this time around was clearly inspired by Halo CE's.

From the very first trailer where Chief is floating through space with his grapple hook floating around him like an infant's umbilical cord, I knew 343 was going for a super-soft reboot of the series and a promise of a new generation of Halo, which they undoubtedly delivered on."
Alan_Sajju,"Dec 21, 2021",8,"Solid story, incredible gameplay and one of the most amazing sandboxes in an FPS game to date. The only cons are biome diversity and the feeling that it needed more content. Content wise, Halo Infinite seems to just have enough to keep the gameplay fresh and it almost seemed like 343i held back a lot. I'd akin Halo Infinite a lot to Horizon Zero Dawn where it's a studio learning the ropes as it charters new and unfamiliar designs tenets where the gameplay is stellar but the story and pacing isn't as mind-blowing. It's an excellent direction for the franchise and a great build up to an eventually better sequel."
BradPig,"Dec 21, 2021",0,"Copy and paste of all the previous halo, on PC it suffers blatant stuttering despite far exceeding 60fps, artifacts everywhere, history copied from the previous ones, art and design silly of apes and grunts, old graphics, zero innovation, they call it nostalgia or classic, it feels dead and empty, what a shame, and yes the same tree all over the map."
rosso97,"Dec 21, 2021",9,I feel like this was the Halo I was waiting for since 343 took charge. The gameplay feels fresh but also sticks to the classic Halo feeling.
Azzanation,"Dec 21, 2021",10,"Halo Infinite is currently one of my favorite Halo games. The Open world design and craftsmanship is incredible. I really enjoyed the story progression as well. The game is well paced and doesn't force the player to grind and travel all over the place like in other open world games. Halo Infinite took me around 10+ hours to complete. Its a 9/10 due to a couple glitches however i gave it a 10 to balance out the negative troll reviews.

Its also on GamePass. Highly Recommended and worth the time."

Kermito_San,"Dec 20, 2021",7,"I did not expect that Halo Infinite would be a hit after all that he has been through, but it turns out it's solid. That doesn't necessarily mean it's good or bad, but in a period where the latest FPS' are full of bugs, weak, and not cured; Halo feels nostalgically good, bringing back players to the golden age of what FPS was like.
Halo Infinite doesn't make the same mistakes that Halo 5 did. It takes an old formula and tweaks it just that much to make it look new and fresh, without sacrificing the nostalgic feeling and the player fan base who wanted a more classic approach; and it does that for every single thing in the game other than the graphics, which looks good, but still have some pop-up issues and the texture resolution is pretty low, a compromise needed to run the game on old-gen console.
Even the music has been taken from Halo 3 and changed just slightly to make it feel fresh and new, the reality is that it's a failed attempt to create an incredible soundtrack like Bungie did. 343 once again proved that it cannot create good music, as the newer song added in the game feels either too loud and annoying, or mild and forgettable.
The campaign tries to bring a more direct and easy-to-understand story, explaining what happened to Cortana and narrating the new bonds that create between Master Chief, the Weapon, and the Pilot. It succeeds, but in doing that, it creates some holes and blackouts in the trama, that must be solved in the next Halo. It seems like 343 wants to keep doing that so that the Halo franchise will never die. To me, it's just the easy way to never end a story that has been going on for far too long, while maintaining the flagship title in the Microsoft console.
One thing that is new and nice is the side quests and collectibles that fit perfectly in the open world. There is always something to do in the Halo and the feeling of warfare is there, whether it's a rescuing mission, or a blitz to a Banished facility, the feeling of bringing 5 marines with your Razorback or blowing up stuff with a Scorpion is genuinely fun.
I would have liked to see those on all the Halo, but for some reason, half of the map it's reserved for the last main quest. Half a map of an already small world it's definitely too much to let through without complaining.
I said that halo is solid, and it is. The feedback of the weapon in Halo infinite it's spectacular. Every weapon has a distinct and clear sound, while also having its own very specific vibration on the character at the screen, but mostly on the controller. The only FPS surpassing this level of feedback it's given by COD Cold War on the DualSense controller, but obviously, Halo can't beat it, without the haptic feedback of its hardware.
Talking about guns, every one of them feels in place. There are no weapons that feel out of pace; every one of them has its strong and weak points, maybe the only exception it's the Commando, which should replace the DRM, but it just feels like a weaker version of an assault rifle.
The melee now has a lounge, which can (or not) be appreciated, but it works as a projectile, rather than an AoE damage, which means that in some closed combat situations you might miss a melee by a millimeter because you didn't aim at point-blank (which makes no sense at all).
Even with a lot of defects, Halo Infinite it's way too fun to not like, and considering that its multiplayer is free, it's way too fun not to play.

Save for a few technical hiccups, I thought this was the best halo game I have played since 2.  I loved the character…yes I even enjoyed the pilot…the story arc, and the cliff hanger at the end.  It worked all so wonderfully.

The game/gunplay is second to none.  It is soooo much fun to drop into a quick MP match or to take on some outposts in the campaign.  Everything is just about perfect.
The multiplayer is really where the game shines.  The progression system at first was annoying but how 343i is so attuned with the community I am nothing but impressed at how they take it to heart and make changes accordingly.

Just a fantastic game and I can’t wait to see where they take it from here."

L3Fari0us,"Dec 20, 2021",9,"Halo Infinite captures the magic many thought to have been lost and it shows that 343i is indeed worthy of taking the mantle and carry the series forward.

Pros:
+Amazing performances & great dialogue
+Beautiful graphics & soundtrack
+Great story that doesn't simply gloss over the previous title's narrative
+New protagonists & villains were very interesting
+The new character upgrades you unlock feel great
+Combat is the best in the series
+A.I. keeps you on your toes
+Boss fights were for the most part challenging & fun
+Weapons all feel great to use & have their own feel to them
+Very polished experience

Cons:
-The side activities started to get a bit boring by the end
-Lack of different environments
-Lack of different types of side activities
-No need to use the different upgrades besides the grappling hook
-Vehicles felt a bit too weak
-A few bosses used one to two shot weapons in tight corridors making the fights frustrating on higher difficulties

Overall, Halo Infinite has a gameplay formula that feels the best the series has ever seen, complimented by a wonderful narrative that seeks to wrap up the more personal Master Chief and Cortana storyline that started back in Halo 4, all while waging war against the Banished, leading up to spectacular moments.
It is, undoubtedly, worth picking up, specially if you've been following the series since the beginning."

Rhinogamer1,"Dec 19, 2021",7,"Decent game, but nothing groundbreaking. The new traversal tool/option is new and interesting, but the gameplay is hindered by being comparatively unimaginative. The game feels like a rehash of the same old Halo tropes without really bringing anything new or interesting to the table; rather relying on the same old tired Halo 'wall of baddies' throwing wave after wave of enemies at the player, but not allowing for inventive gameplay.. Pretty much just your standard Halo arena-based combat rinse & repeat.

I get that players will want their sense of nostalgia satisfied in a Halo game, and maybe the FPS genre is just out of ideas, but overall the game just feels a little lackluster and lazy for such a flagship piece. Mostly went through the game with a sense of ""been there, done that"".

The upgrade system is somewhat interesting, and brings a little additional life to the game. All in all, not horrid, but feels a little stale...7/10."

AliquisNomine,"Dec 19, 2021",6,"Good things: story, characters and the core gameplay. Everything else: underwhelming.

The open world is a nice fresh feature, but it's incredibly bland. Feels empty. Lifeless. Copy-paste spruce trees everywhere (literally, you can see there's just a couple templates that's been replicated). Basically just a single biome with little variation is a major disappointment, considering cool different environments have made the Halo campaigns so great in the past.

The campaign missions are boring, repetitive. Endless forerunner corridors. At some point I just wanted to run it to the end to just get it over with. It's riddled with bugs on Xbox Series X. Freezing (fortunately, no crashing thought), checkpoints not registering, stuttering music on the ""epic"" moments..

Many on social media have pointed out how funny the marines are, behaving like idiots. To me, it's just another indication that despite the 6+1 years (?) of development, it still feels rushed, unfinished. And don't get me even started with the multiplayer.

I'd say the graphics are average at the best. Doesn't really look like next gen to me. In comparison, if you look at the environment e.g. of few year old Red Dead Redemption 2, it's miles ahead in everything.

I guess they really tried. The story and general feel makes it a great Halo game, they succeeded in that better than in Halo 5. But it's far from a polished game and it's a shame as this could have been so much better. I think they should have focused purely on Series X/PC version instead of wasting resources to make it play on prev gen consoles.  I hope they will address some of the issues in the future.

Anyone giving it a 10/10 as it is right now is lying."
Synze,"Dec 19, 2021",10,"Such a great game, definitely a refreshing game to the franchise. The gameplay is a straight up 10/10 for me, the bosses feel unique as do all other encounters. The open world did feel a little empty sometimes, but there were still a lot of patrols which I liked. The dialogue in this game in insane. My favourite being the propaganda grunt, I honestly say there for about 20 minutes just listening to his dialogue. The grunts insults in this game hit home harder than bassus's gravity hammer in LASO. Even  roasting the master chief about his mum. So many little details too, one like grunts sleep at night (another thing, I wished night for a little darker than what it does) grunts sleep and when elites are just patrolling they will have their shields deactivated and will activate them when they enter combat. There are some other things I did not really enjoy, but my god was it gun to load up a razor back with 5 marines with arch dental beams and just watching every enemy just melt before you. Moving onto the story, halo 2's is my favourite by far, and was originally my favourite campaign in the series just because of that story being one of the best out there (also, **** sniper jackets). Legendary felt a little easy, harder than halo 3 but much less than halo 2 and a little less than halo CE. I believe halo CE has the best balance ofor legendary difficulty, a really hard challenge like it should be but not make you want to lunch your monitor like halo 2 did at some points (once again, **** sniper jackets you incarnated pieces of dinasour bird pieces of **** There are many other things I could get into, but to warp this up halo infinite is now tied with halo 2 for me with a score of 9.8/10. Halo 2 for the best story and halo infinite for easily the best gameplay. I could not decide which was better, because that just wouldn't be fair so I tied them. They are both 9.8/10 to me, and are all in my top 5."

malikfaraz63,"Dec 19, 2021",9,"Halo Infinite is a fantastic sandbox shooter game. The gunplay is spot-on, graphics are fantastic on the Series X, and the game is very well-optimised for the device. Campaign looks great, so does multiplayer. It all feels like Halo.
Story is good, but Escharum does feel a bit forced. He doesn't seem to have his own objective alongside being the antagonist (think Tartarus's objective of lighting the ring while opposing the Arbiter), besides sitting and waiting for the Chief. But there are moments that are very emotive, and make you feel invested in the story.

Only 9/10 because the game is missing Campaign co-op at launch, and I would have loved to play this first-time with my brother. Also, the 'Doomsday' mechanic for vehicles is a bit haphazard and not very explicit in the lead-up to your vehicle's destruction (i.e. should have had engine on fire effects).

It does a great job of wrapping up the convoluted direction the Halo universe was going in, after the events of Halo 5, and really opens the doors to future sequels over the next 10 years."
Baintrain,"Dec 19, 2021",10,"Regarding the campaign, while Halo 3's story will always be my personal favorite, this Halo is the best halo experience in the franchise history.

Ironlion77,"Dec 19, 2021",8,"I heard one reviewer on YouTube say that the campaign ended too abruptly. I felt that way about Halo 2. I totally disagree with that reviewer. I was very satisfied with the campaign. It upped the action and the ante as it got to the end battles. The story was cohesive and helped tie some of the confusing events of the last few games together. As far as the campaign, the only issue I had with it was the marine A.I. There were times when I would call in a vehiclle drop, and the idiot would just stand there and get killed. *eye roll* Other times with the car full of marines, they aren't shooting as much as they need to be. I remember in past Halo games your A.I. marines would sometimes drive vehicles and help out more. I wish that would happen here. Like if we pull up in a Warthog and I see a Ghost. Let me grab the Ghost and someone else take the Warthog! Smh...otherwise I felt like the campaign was great. The multiplayer is cool. I don't play it often because I don't like people, but it still plays smoothly. Can't wait for co-op campaign and to see what the future holds."
trose6025,"Dec 19, 2021",0,"We have reached the state where Halo gameplay and story no longer feel like Halo.

Cesar8,"Dec 18, 2021",8,"Un titulo muy esperado y que a la vez tuvo muchas caidas durante su desarrollo y despues de 1 año de retraso ya tenemos el resultado final de este titulo. Empezando con la historia, me ha parecida buena, nada extraordinario que a la vez si lo piensas bien, es algo corta, la cual el juego depende mucho de los encargos que hay dentro del mapa para extender mas la duracion. Algo que a mi parecer no me sigue de cuadrar es el hecho que en cada Halo apartir del 4 cambian la amenaza que hay en el universo, por ejemplo en Halo 4 la nueva amenaza que son los Prometeos, de la cual en Halo 5 pasan a segundo plano y nos ponen que la amenaza mayor es Cortana y sus Guardians y ahora en este juego decidieron desascerse de ella de manera muy facil, al igual que los Guardians, esas amenazas que podian controlar universos completos parece que nunca existieron, pero agradezco que durante el juego nos hayan contado la caida de Cortana y no solamente que se hayan tenido que apoyar del universo extendido para contarnos lo que pudo haber pasado. Otro punto que me ha gustado de la historia es la instroduccion del Arma, que te da un aire de inocencia, de pureza, como de alguien que en verdad nunca ha visto el mal, como si recien hubiera nacido y apenas esta aprendiendo de este mundo y todo lo ve con unos ojos inocentes. Luego tenemos al Jefe Maestro, que me gusto que hayan retomado ese elemento de Halo 4 en la cual nos muestran un lado mas humano de el, nos muestran que tiene sentimientos, que nos hacen ver que el no es solamente un soldado  que sigue ordenes sino que en ciertos momentos podemos ver que aveces esta cerca de quebrarse solo por alguien que considera immportante. Los jefes o los antagonistas principales de este juego, la verdad es que se me han hecho buenos, pero considero poco memorables, siento que en verdad no tuvieron un  momento importante como patra decir esto sera recordado en la saga Halo por siempre o por un largo tiempo. Hablando del mapa o como el estudio lo llama un mundo semiabierto me ha parecido hablando de la saga Halo, un gran apunte para lasaga, algo que ya necesitaba, aires frescos para llevar esto a otro nivel, pero si hablamos de este a nivel general en comparacion a otros titulos en el mercado, se me hace un mapa algo verde, en donde en verdad se nota que este es el primer mundo semiabierto que hace el estudio, se me hizo que le falto mas variedad de biomas en el mapa, y mas sabiendo que la saga nos ha entregado mapas de playas, biomas nevados, deserticos, pantanos etc. Siento que este lo hicieron de una manera de ir a lo seguro, pero espero que durante las expansiones que tienen planeados, saquen esos biomas que hacen falta para darle mas variedad al mapa. Hablando de las misiones secundarias que hay en todo el mapa, creo que cumplen su cometido, hacer que el jugador en verdad quiera ir a explorar el mapa, conocerlo mas, conocer mas de su historia. Pero que eso si, cumplir esos elementos no aportan nada a la historia o hacen algun cambio, por ejemplo, no se ven consecuencias de conquistar las bases enemigas, de la cual tristemente cae en lo repetitivo o inclusive en un par de ellas son casi iguales y ya sabes que hacer. Otro punto importante que agregaron fueron los diferentes bosses en el mapa para ir a matar, me ha parecido un gran añadido dandole un poco mas de razon para explorar y tomar las armas que te dan al eliminarlos, pero tristemente, vuelvo a los mismo, no se ve nada afectos en la historia o el mapa tras irlos matando. Otro de estos puntos han sido las torres de propaganda que el mismo juego aveces te da a entender lo que le puede pasar a quien habla si sigues destruyendo las torres, pero pasa lo mismo las destruyes, pero no pasa nada, nos sabes tan siquiera si le paso algo al encargado de las torres. El apartado artistico me ha parecido algo increible la verdad, en el mapa la verdad aveces te quedas sorpendido o embobado por los paisajes y se me ha hecho uno de los puntos mas fuertes, no solo en los paisajes sino tambien algunos efectos de luz, particulas o interiores de estructuras. En el apartado sonoro, Halo nunca falla la verdad combinando sonidos nuevos y a la vez sonidos muy clasicos de la saga y eso es algo de agradecer. La verdad un titulo increible que tiene sus errores que muestra una vez mas que es su primera vez estando en este nuevo apartado pero que se agradece por llevar a la saga a un nuevo nivel y haciendolo con amor, espero que con el paso del tiempo ellos vayan aprendiendo, que vean sus puntos debiles y vayan superandose."
Sebyiscool1,"Dec 18, 2021",10,I played halo ce and halo 2 and this is just a great game. Multiplayer was  great but the campaign was just God tier. Definitely worth goty
Bilacomy,"Dec 18, 2021",10,"Congratulations 343, you finally understood what halo is about and made us a great game"
Julio_Ortiz,"Dec 18, 2021",10,"This game is a masterpiece, 343i managed to not just improve their past mistakes but actually deliver an adequate Halo game in every aspect. Halo Infinite is a respectful homage to the roots and identity of the saga while innovating in every aspect. A well executed story with an astounding arch, beautiful and truly next-gen graphics, incredible soundtrack, amazing gameplay and mechanics. This well crafted campaign is brimming with life, from the believable enemy outposts to the survivors from the UNSC wreckage you can find all over Zeta Halo. The verticality and improved movement thanks to the Grappleshot is phenomenal, the new weapons and vehicle delivery service is great, and the overall design of this ring world is mesmerizing. I wish the campaign was longer, however the replay value is an evolution from all Halo games. A total success."
SebasSC11,"Dec 18, 2021",9,"A nice Halo game, excelent shooter experience. The game adds new mechanics and has an excelent campaing. I recomended this game"
Bfctrick,"Dec 18, 2021",9,"Before this game didn't really play any halo since halo 3 as it got slightly stale but I decided to try this and overall its a really good game best one I've played all year.

Hopefully more dlc will come and the game continues to improve in the future."
ReVdxGlitchesx,"Dec 18, 2021",2,"You know I am surprised that this game has been so highly rated so far. For me it just falls flat. Don't get me wrong Infinite has some great ideas such as the boss fights and the open world, but the game as a whole does not stand up to the past games. Let me explain. And yes there might be mild spoilers, but I will try to keep them to a minimum.

First off the open world is very repetitive. I'm not talking about the environment or the graphics, but the missions you can complete in the open world. First of there are 3 basic missions you can do: saving squads, Boss battles, and capturing FOBs. There are about 47 of these missions give or take. I might have missed a few, but the thing is at the end of the day all these missions are the same. Kill all the enemies in the area. Well that's ok and its fun to wipe out enemies. There are a few variations in the boss battles and some have different kinds of enemies, but they really are just the same. Doing the missions over, and over, and over, and over, and over again gets boring and a little grindy.  Some games try to over come the grindiness by making the boss battles harder. Which although it might be the same mission you still get satisfaction, because at least it was hard. Well in this game these missions get easier. The primary reason for this is because as you progress these side missions you get different vehicles and weapons. So you get to a point were you can spawn a tank, wasp, sniper rifle, or a rocket launcher whenever you want. As you can imagine this makes the game pretty easy.

Secondly there are about 7-8 what I would call mid tier missions. These are missions where instead of clearing out a whole base of enemies you destroy fuel silos or ammo machines. However these too are also fairly similar to each other and none are particularly difficult, and again get easier because of the whole weapons and vehicle aspect.

Lastly, I believe there are about 13 Main Missions. These are by far the best part of the game, or at least they are what I enjoyed the most. However, they took me the least amount of time to finish. I completed the entire game in about 24hrs of casual game play. This is for all the missions not just the main mission. I was not trying to go anywhere fast, and most of my time was spent completing all the side missions. I was kinda surprised that the game was fished so quickly, and in the end I was left wanting more, because I felt like the story was not even that developed yet. Also, without giving too much away they really rely on emotions of players who have played halo in the past. What I mean is I believe the campaign will be much less enjoyable for people who have never played Halo as they will not be as emotionally invested. I definitely expected more from the campaign of this game.

In the end I personally believe that this is the worst Halo game of all time. The open world is nice and graphics are good, but the missions are repetitive. The whole game takes about 24hrs to complete everything if you are taking your time and enjoying the sights. For an open world Halo game it defiantly falls flat. There are many other mission possibilities, but they chose to be lazy. I hope that this is not the trend for Halo. Although I know this will fall on deaf ears, and I hope you will disagree because then at least you had fun right?"
Antonette_87,"Dec 18, 2021",9,"Halo necesita un cambio?
343I si piensa que sea así haciendo que en vez de que la historia transcurra en niveles, transcurra en un mundo amplio y semi-abierto, y aquí esta el primer problema... Halo Infinite tiene un mundo vacío, no lo digo porq no haya cosas que hacer en el mundo, donde tiene varias misiones secundarias, aunque sean repetitivas a largo plazo, pero el problema se indica cuando nos paseamos por el mundo a explorar, no hay vida, tal vez un par de enemigos y 3 ratas pero no es suficiente para un juego de esta escala. Halo Infinite fue criticado por sus gráficos razón por la cual se retraso un año, bien han mejorado los graficos a comparación de la demo de 2020? sí. Halo Infinite tiene buenos gráficos? No. Halo Infinite puede ser bonito en espacios cerrados, pero en el mundo abierto, cuando estamos en una cima de una montaña o montado en un waps, vemos que a lo lejos se ven arboles y lagos con unas texturas pesimas, sin contar de que hay un poping excesivo y algunos bugs visuales, haciendo que la experiencia sea afectada negativamente. Aunque no todo es malo en Halo Infinite, tiene una muy buena historia con nuevos personajes, con conflictos internos, y todo eso sabe hacer muy bien Halo Infinite hacer que los personajes sean creíbles y entrañables, y añadale las grabaciones donde nos cuentan relatos de los spartan o marines en el anillo o en la caída del Infinity, el punto de vista de los desterrados, como alaban tanto a atreux, archivos forreuner que añaden lore a la saga y también conserva ese misterio y misticismo durante toda la entrega, recordando a los primeros Halo. Porq este Halo recuerda mucho a los primeros, con escenarios semejantes, con el gameplay haciendo que sea un halo moderno y que se siente como halo, el online es similar al de Halo 3, y el online es muy bueno pero se sieente incompleto sin el modo forga, pero aún así me parece un online muy bueno aunq sea incompleto."

InfernalD,"Dec 18, 2021",10,"343 nailed it out of the Park, A New Halo game that may exceed the original trilogy. An intriguing open world and story, beautiful environments, intense multiplayer. Crossplay, F2P, Single Player, Splitscreen! The Developers are quick to address any issues with the game immediately and have been entirely commendable thus far. My Personal GOTY and I expect I'll be playing this game for a very long time.

Multiplayer is Live Service so I expect the best is yet to come. (Forge,Customs, Co-op, Story DLC is coming!!!)"
MachoBrizzin,"Dec 18, 2021",9,"After playing the campaign through to completion, and spending over 24 hours of gameplay in Multiplayer, I can say that Halo Infinite is a testament to how well the tried-and-true formula of the series can stand against the test of time. This simplified shooter gameplay has been evolved in a natural, organic manner that truly feels like a finally worthwhile sequel to Halo 3 in 2007.

It focuses on the ""equal starts"" that are core to good Arena shooters, but expands the player's options by adding to the ""sandbox"", giving the players so many interesting toys to fight over and use.

The multiplayer component is definitely missing tons of legacy features, however, and suffers from quite a few bugs (some game-breaking) on PC.

The campaign tells an incredible story shrouded in mystery (intentionally). What happened between Halo 5 and the present day is gradually discovered by the player as the conflict with the new faction, the Banished, escalates. The open world gameplay is incredibly fresh and in no way ""ubisofty"". It takes the exploration aspects Halo: Combat Evolved's second mission ""Halo"" and expands it on an epic scale. You won't be hunting animals, crafting equipment, or even obtaining side quests from characters. The story is told in a very linear way, while also allowing for free exploration at your own pace. The narrative is not hindered by this.

The exploration is incredibly involved and organic as well. There are so many things you can encounter that's not marked on the map. Things from structures, artifacts, and conflicts. There's surprisingly so much to do. Halo Infinite has re-invented the Open World genre in a way that feels like a natural extension of its traditional shooter gameplay."
DanyGG_,"Dec 18, 2021",0,"ESP. Exelente modalidad de juego, campaña y sobre todo una carta a los fans y a los nuevos para darnos un gran juego. Gracias 343

SmartAlec775,"Dec 18, 2021",9,"Most fun I have had in a Halo game since Reach. Great gameplay, sandbox, and the grapplehook is awesome. The campaign was good but would have liked to have seen more biomes like desert or jungle. Multiplayer is a blast but could use more content. Overall great game."
Britt_,"Dec 18, 2021",9,"The campaign is something to experience, it isn’t short like other halo campaigns. Since this game is open world you can explore for as long as you want and find collectables and save marines. The boss fights are absolutely incredible and are each unique, the ending boss fight is a little bland but everything else is top tier. Multiplayer is a bit of a mess currently but can be easily fixed. All in all, a great game that saves Halo."
ShervinGrey,"Dec 18, 2021",10,Best game ever.  The grapple hook is amazing. The story is marvelous and the multiplayer is breath taking.
carlosgraph7,"Dec 18, 2021",10,"Halo ha regresado por todo lo alto, no estaba muerto andaba de parranda. 100% recomendado."
Pruy_87,"Dec 18, 2021",10,"Halo Infinite es el videojuego más divertido que he jugado en este 2021, tanto en su modo multiplayer como en su modo campaña. El frenetismo de los combates le hace justicia a los mejores títulos de la saga y el gancho le da un plus de verticalidad a los escenarios que transforma completamente la forma en la que habitualmente luchas en los shooters. Jugablemente es la evolución definitiva de un Halo, toma cosas de Doom y de Destiny pero no pierde su esencia. La diversión y la jugabilidad es el punto más importante en todo videojuego y debo decir que, al menos en este año 2021, Halo Infinite es el número uno en este aspecto.

Gráficamente cumple con creces pero donde realmente luce es en el estilo artístico del mundo. Zeta Halo es un lugar que quieres descubrir, que quieres explorar, que quieres recorrer, que quieres investigar. Es hermoso el mundo que han construido para este videojuego. Combates y te diviertes en un entorno que rebosa una energía especial.

Sin entrar en Spoilers, podemos adelantar que la historia de Halo Infinite es un guiño permanente a la relación del Jefe y Cortana. Si has desarrollado un vínculo con la IA en entregas anteriores y los desterrados te parecen los enemigos más interesantes en el universo Halo esta historia te va a encantar tanto como a mí. Todo está bien contado, bien narrado, incluso existen momentos que sacuden tus emociones y te hacen querer avanzar en la historia para conocer cómo sigue la trama. Excelente.

Respeto las críticas sobre ciertos puntos del juego y algunas de ellas las entiendo. Podríamos decir que su estructura de mundo abierto responde a la tradicional y ya agotada fórmula de los Assassin's creed. Pero, al igual que ha ocurrido con Ghost of Tsushima, el combate es tan divertido que limpiar las diferentes zonas del mapa no es tedioso sino todo lo contrario. Zeta Halo es un enorme parque de diversiones en el que puedes hacer destrozos en todas las instalaciones de los desterrados.

Cierto es que los escenarios interiores se tornan algo clónicos como han asegurado la gente que se sienta a jugar al juego con cara de culo intentando buscarle algún defecto. Este es un aspecto que ha perseguido a la saga siempre, Halo Infinite no es la excepción. Teniendo en cuenta el gran mundo que han construido lo cierto es que se hecha de menos un poco más de esfuerzo para currarse más los interiores. No es que estén mal diseñados, algunos son realmente hermosos, pero las salas son demasiado parecidas entre sí. Esto puede llegar a molestar porque realmente es un punto que no está a la altura de todo lo demás.

Sobre el multijugador solo puedo decir: Gracias 343I . Admito que me estaba quedando fuera de absolutamente todos los shooter multijugador online del momento. Call of Duty, Fornite, Valorant,
Battlefield... todos respondían a a la misma fórmula que se me hacía ajena. Jugar al Halo Infinite Multiplayer fue como volver al Quake III Arena pero con un juego digno de la actual generación de consolas, con la tecnología punta del 2021. Ojalá las próximas mejoras no alteren su esencia.

No soy de escribir reviews pero creía que en este caso todo lo que me dio el juego merecía que vuelque mi experiencia en estas líneas. Espero que mis impresiones le sirvan a otro usuario."
KingHenry2K,"Dec 18, 2021",1,I was highly disappointed thought it was gonna have a bunch of cool new modes but you can't even choose ones you like. Pop ins are out of control. Its a better multi-player than the last one but that's not saying much. It's fun and free and thats all that saves this game.
VisualPenny690,"Dec 18, 2021",8,"Bom jogo de tiro, o melhor dentre os halos. Gráfico bonito, jogabilidade excelente (pra mim o diferencial), e uma história muito boa e bem contada. O defeito que eu encontrei foi  a repetitividade de inimigos e cenários, de um jogo desse tamanho e importância eu esperava um pouco mais."
HouseOfX,"Dec 18, 2021",1,"Game is super boring, really repetitive and it takes like 9 hours to complete. All the changes they made,  make it feel like Call of Duty. People like to hype this game for no reason."

The theme for me is the best Halo with various. Fantastic battles and a fantastic Ai. The feel of the guns when shooting is even better. I would put him in the negative that he does not have the co-op from the beginning"
Matrix324,"Dec 17, 2021",10,Halo infinite es un juego bastante bueno y si ningún tipo de dudas el juego más completo de la saga. Lo recomiendo.
kasproviez,"Dec 17, 2021",0,"looks like 6 years of development and can't even get the basics right of the halo franchise.
Sad that people don’t know what a good game is anymore… yeah voted game of the year because of the **** ton of marketing money being paid to companies to hype up a game that’s barely even finished or good. And if you think its a long story mode think again. Take out all the ridiculous side quest (repeated boring task) and time waster content its actually about 5-7hrs of story like the last halo. The story would of been fun to play if they didn’t make map of a bunch of **** cliffs,rocks, trees that make ground transport unfun. Game actually felt good when you unlocked the flying aircraft … when the game is basically over. Im tired of these paid reviews of saying “oh game isn’t perfect so I’ll give it 10 stars” . Go play Assassins greed a open world game than play this garbage of a open world take. 343 industries still trying to copy bungie developers who actually know how to execute an idea. Also lastly how you gonna blow up the infinity ship and not make that part of the main story just little audio files of what apparently was an entire epic battle like wtf the story should of been more than waking up on a halo ring after the cliffhanger of the previous halo"

Lytelcyning,"Dec 17, 2021",10,"I am a massive fan of the Halo franchise. I've been playing the games, reading the books and engaging in any and all forms of media when it comes to Halo since the very beginning. Halo Infinite is without a doubt a return to form. Mixing both classic elements of what makes Halo... Halo! And evolving itself with new mechanics within the game play.

The story beats, music, atmosphere all of it comes together perfectly in my opinion. And this is just the campaign side of things. The multiplayer has had its missteps. But I attribute all of that to the dismal microtransaction system. Throwing that fact aside. The rest of multiplayer is amazing and has me excited for the future of Halo Infinite.

Though some may not agree. This game is an absolute 10 for me. Just from campaign alone. I will be playing through this one a multitude of times and I am SO INCREDIBLY excited for the future DLC coming to Halo Infinite. Further expanding on the phenomenal foundation 343 has built for this game. 343 Industries, if one or more of you happen to read this. I hope you all maintain the recipe you have here. Because currently, the flavor of this game is superb.

If you haven't played this one yet, definitely give it a shot. And play the previous entries as well. You wont regret it."

gdfreview,"Dec 17, 2021",8,"8,7- nota justa
Halo Infinite é um jogo que tem um potencial absurdo mas que infelizmente não foi bem aproveitado, o jogo mostra de cara que teve muitos problemas em seu desenvolvimento, o tempo de desenvolvimento é dito de 6 anos, mas creio que não passe de 3... Ele é bom em todos aspectos, mas em todos os aspectos o jogo poderia ser melhor, Sua campanha é boa, é emotiva, porém não é uma campanha muito épica se comparada aos demais Halo, são poucos os momentos realmente marcantes durante a campanha, o jogo é com certeza melhor que o 5, um pouco melho que o ODST e bate de frente em termos gerais com Halo 4, se fosse apenas a campanha, creio que halo 4 seria dito como melhor... Halo Infinite muito provavelmente seja o melhor halo da 343, porém acaba sendo um tanto decepcionante em certas coisas, para mim, a mudança de gráfico foi algo pesado, se eles queriam trocar o motor gráfico do jogo, eles deveriam ter apostado em ambientação e detalhes,infelizmente o jogo peca nos 2 sentidos, no mundo aberto existe apenas um bioma, de perto os detalher são poucos, em áreas fechadas é tudo muito parecido, por mais que seja um jogo bonito, halo merecia mais....
Sua jogabilidade e sua trilha sonora são ABSURDAS, é de longe a melhor jogabilidade de halo, e de longe a melhor trilha sonora desde que a 343 assumiu halo, é de deixar arrepiado..."
FabricioNery,"Dec 17, 2021",10,"Fantastic game, with a very fun campaign. Gameplay is a lot of fun, especially the inclusion of the hook."
BeardedYoda,"Dec 17, 2021",9,"Played on Xbox Series X - As someone who has been a fan of Halo for a long time, I can safely say that Halo Infinite is the best Halo has been in over a decade. The gameplay in Infinite is an excellent mixture of the modern, fluent gameplay of many current FPS's, and the classic open ended, fast paced, and detailed combat of old school FPS's. The campaign in Halo Infinite is pretty good and is certainly the most entertaining and intriguing story 343 Industries has told since taking over the Halo franchise in 2011. The gameplay, enemy variety, story, and characters in the campaign are all very good as a whole. There are problems in the campaign when it comes to level diversity, or the lack of it. Another problem I have experienced has to do with how useful most of the equipment you get throughout the campaign actually is; as I really only used the Grappleshot throughout the story, and on occasion the Threat Sensor. I also very much wish that Halo Infinites campaign had co-op at launch, but I know that it will be added to the game later down the line. Halo Infinite does feel a lot like a combination of Doom Eternal, Far Cry, and the classic Halo games. You would think that this combination would be a bit of a mess, but it works pretty well and Is very fun.

When it comes to multiplayer, Halo Infinite is bordering on excellency. What is in Halo Infinites multiplayer is spectacular, it is what is not in it that is upsetting. As of this review there is a lack of modes in matchmaking, as well as some big problems when it comes to not being able to choose specific multiplayer modes/playlists; with players having to rely on luck much of the time if they want to get the right game mode for a challenge. Speaking of challenges, they need work. Doing challenges is the only way to level up in infinite, as the only ranking system in the game is the Battle Pass. Because everyone is going out of their way to do challenges to level up, it brakes up a matches flow and can result in some unpleasant moments in a match. This, combined with the lack of earnable customization and the heavy monetization of other customizations, is incredibly disappointing, if not infuriating.

Over all, Halo Infinite has some big flaws, but these flaws are easily fixable. And even with these flaws the game is worth buying, it really is just that good. Heck, the multiplayer is free to play. If you are able to try the games multiplayer out, then there is no reason not to."
GhostBullet217,"Dec 17, 2021",10,"Greate game, for a pandemic year. We have had a rough time with covid among other things that had happened in the last two years. 343 did a great job pulling through.

DarkJester,"Dec 17, 2021",1,"I have no idea who gave this game 10/10 scores or even 9/10 scores, Because this game is just touching a 5/10 in any objective opinion. The graphic's are not a 10/10 i've seen better from other games, Even games i don't like, The charactor's are not very great in design that hair and beard on Echo looked so bad, The face of ""The Weapon"" because i refuse to call her anything else other than the Failed replacement for a far superior character in every way, Her ""outfit"" was bland unimaginitive compared to ANY incarnation that came before. John 117 was fine to be honest the only thing i thought looked stupid was the grapple hook, An idiotic machanic added for... Because Spider-Man is popular ? I mean i legit only liked the look of the Blade Master who's name i don't remember like just about every character in this game. I can ask people who played Combat Evolved names of Characters, Or ships and they can give me then within the snap of my fingers and not just The first Halo but the other two as well. Even the 4th though most in that game are forgettable too as well as 5. So if graphicly the game is about average to slightly above average why is it getting a 10/10 ? I mean reviewers have pointed this out too it's not just me. The story is boring practically non exsisting and trying to re-write the story.. Again to make another big bad yea.. 10/10 ? Yea.. not so much. It's passible again a 5/10 average, Nothing spectacular happens in this story, The story is not interesting or tension filled. 343 did Halo 4 and although i did not find the game as bad as others i can say i freaken teared up at the end, At cut scenes throughout because the story was personal, It hit the feels if your invested in the characters and the story, If you understand the characters and story and it made the end feel almost bittersweet and even that story i'd say was an 8 out of 10 because it's not just about that story its to do with another big bad who hates earth bla bla bla. It's generic and i call it out for what it is despite my love for the majority of the game. None of that is here and it had elements in 5 but 5 again was about average just like this game, It dose nothing to earn a 10 in short any aspect you can point out you'll find it actually is not as good or as worthy to have that 10, I think the reason it got high scores is becase of the low standerds we have for games these days. I gave this a score of 1 and for simple reason, It never deserved anything more from me. The 5 out of 10 is for those not invested as much as i was, Ti those who are this story is frankly insulting. I wont go into details, But the main bad AI set up for this game is not here and has no satisfying resalution, A basic failure in story telling. Character's where just there the game did nothing to make me like them with one character on the bad side looking cool the Blade Master i cared for no one, Even the moments meant to be sad i was rolling my eyes wanting to skip, Combat was meh never felt like a Halo game to me felt like what someone who had never played Halo thought Halo might be like. If i want to play Spider-Man, CoD, BF and every other game this game was trying to be i'd just go play them, I PLAY HALO FOR HALO crazy right ? People are gripping onto Multiplayer like its the best thing ever, It's not there are older games who have done prety good multiplayer **** relax. All that said and a long list more it earns nothing but scorn from me, It made no attempt at telling a story in Halo that was satisfying and would hold or peek interests in playing the next game, Even 5 managed to do that feat and that feat only, That again only goes to show how bad this game is. Who are the bad guys that are coming ? Do you even care ? I don't my investment was with the rogue AI who was a friend part of the heart of Halo and what they did with that gets it a 0 in its own right. This games **** when compared to ever other Halo FACT. {0,0}"

sbsbaker,"Dec 17, 2021",10,"It's incredible that the game launched as polished and fun as it is with the trouble it went through in it's development, which speaks to the talent on the team.  There is a lot of things missing, but that's par for course for modern games.  We don't have to be happy with it, but most people do vastly underestimate how difficult it is to make games.  The future is bright if 343 continues to develop Infinite over it's lifetime.

I think the worst thing that can happen that nobody is talking about is 343 letting more talent get lost in another round of revolving door contracts, especially the people responsible for the well received aspects of the game.  Forget the store, monetization, battle pass issues. All of these things can be addressed with feedback and talented developers to make the changes needed.  Seems like losing the knowledge and experience working with a proprietary engine to expiring contracts would really hurt 343's ability to continue to improve on Infinite's launch."

MutedEternal,"Dec 17, 2021",7,"The campaign is better than I expected yes but a lot of questions are going to be left unanswered which can and can’t be a good thing for some people. Either way I enjoyed the gameplay, the story, and soundtrack. Much better than Halo 5 thank goodness! Now for the multiplayer…… Nothing I have positive for. The customization options are below average such as not being able to choose your own armor coatings, little amount of choices, and the only way to get more is by paying actual money for credits on a free game is unbelievable. So that deducts points from my perspective. But nonetheless, If you’re a Halo fan, I’d highly recommend this game for the campaign. Multiplayer can be fun but the developers need to buckle down and improve it."

TuxedoMRY,"Dec 16, 2021",10,"Buen juego con gráficas buenas, jugabilidad e historia eso si te da como una sensación que le faltaba más cosas pero aun así recomendable"
JK666,"Dec 16, 2021",1,The lack of content is astounding I don't care about the campaign at all but the multiplayer is severely lacking in content
Lukas3176,"Dec 16, 2021",9,"Good shooting, so-so map and quests. More transport and weapon. Good WEAPON. Good Halo. 9/10."
Rekless,"Dec 16, 2021",10,It's Halo in an open world the mechanics on a controller are smooth as always and playing on an Xbox with the ability to jump in an out of the game is amazing great job!

KavKaldwin,"Dec 16, 2021",4,"Solid gameplay, with an open world and a storyline that at first glance might look big and wide as the ocean, but ultimately ends up being as deep as a puddle.

Incongruent world building that clashes with pre-existing ideas in the Halo universe, established by 343 themselves on alt media like novels.

Repetitive and uninteresting open world mechanic."
danuffo,"Dec 16, 2021",9,"Ni lo he jugado pero soy amable en subirle la nota porque al ver que tiene traducción y doblaje mexicano, con eso se gana automáticamente una nota alta, ojalá empresas como Capcom o Square Enix ¡APRENDAN!

Los doblajes de España deberían quedarse solo en las películas, sobran mucho en el mundo de los videojuegos al meter tanto modismo, por lo menos exíganles ser más neutros."
mrgnktevetias,"Dec 16, 2021",10,"After playing last two instalments and being thoroughly disappointed I can safely say this is one of the best Halo game in A LONG TIME. The graphics are stunning, the movement is flawless, open world could use a bit more stuff to do but let's be honest we're here for the story. I can guarantee you THEY NAILED IT. You will have a lump at the back of your throat towards the end of the story. Highly recommend playing this if you are a Halo fan."
Abelariel,"Dec 16, 2021",10,"Ha vuelto el Rey Halo regresa después de 6 años y de paso celebrando los 20 años de una saga emblemática.
Mucho se esperaba de este juego y no defraudo en absoluto. El Jefe vuelve para demostrar una vez más quien es el rey  de los FPS. El anillo de semi mundo abierto le da un toque especial, uno siente la necesidad de explorar y adrentarse en lo desconocido.
Las misiones secundarias luego de de largas sesiones se pueden sentir repetitivas pero para nada llega a volverse aburrido o monótono ya que la gran baza  es  que jugabilidad a prueba de bombas.
Halo devolucióna en su línea, el gancho es lo mejor que le pudo pasar a la franquicia, recorrer los escenarios con el es toda una delicia, intuitivo y practico .
Los mini  jefes son todo un acierto , son duros, con armaduras y armas especiales pero no tienen un patrón si no es la habilidad del jugador.
La IA aliada  en nombre the weapon es súper carismática  y  las líneas de diálogo que tienen junto al jefe son extraordinarias.
ni hablar de su increíble BSO."
Elliottdavide,"Dec 16, 2021",9,Great game. Certain aspects get a bit repetitive but the combat is very fun!
Lord_Snow1,"Dec 16, 2021",10,Best gameplay in series & does a great job introducing new characters & setting up next story in universe. Master chief is amazing in this game. Just absolute best gameplay in series & sandbox is the stand out.
CRAZYINDIANXX,"Dec 16, 2021",10,After playing through the full campaign and 30 hours in the multiplayer this game is phenomenal.
ArcticZearo,"Dec 16, 2021",8,343 set out to give Halo fans the best Halo game they could and they definitely delivered. With some minor problems Halo Infinite is THE best Halo game since Halo 3. The progression system at launch was really bad and the shop prices are a bit extreme but overall Halo Infinite is a welcomed return to form and a great game for both old and new fans.
Yoshirox,"Dec 16, 2021",10,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
Vicst4rr,"Dec 16, 2021",10,"Halo Infinite reaches new heights with a massive open world style campaign and incredible fluid gameplay. The story is very well done and even after you complete the campaign, you can go back and explore the entire map for new discoveries and side missions to tackle. 343I knocked it out of the park with this game and is a great leap forward from previous titles in the series. Halo fans new and old will definitely be pleased and give that sense of nostalgia."
kholland65,"Dec 16, 2021",8,"Overall I think this is one of the better halo's. Maybe not halo 2 or 3 (still the best in my opinion) which are classics, but I believe it's in the top half.

The campaign is fun and I really like the open world concept which gives me a bit more freedom to play the game according to my style, or just straight up kill enemies for fun, or explore the map. I just think it's a little on the short side compared to similar games with similar gameplay like assassins creed, fallout, etc.

Multiplayer feels ok. Again not as good as 2 or 3, but it feels good enough to enjoy. Some guns I think are kind of useless in multiplayer, the TTK is a little long, but overall the game still feels pretty good, has decent maps, decent features, and decent game types. Nothing earth **** here, but I do think the multiplayer is very playing and is still fun.

I like the cosmetics but I don't like the way the battle pass works. I'm not a challenge doing person, I just like to play my way and still get xp but that's not the case here.

So overall it's between an 8-9 for me. It's not a perfect game, but overall I feel pretty good about it as far as halo goes and have generally enjoyed it thus far even though I do have a couple of gripes with things."
Delpoi,"Dec 16, 2021",10,They have really upped the game the campaign is a joy to play I love the more open world nature of it plus the gun play is perfect add the grappling hook and you got a fun fast shooter the story is on point to I remember combat evolved this is definitely an evolution.
Ozymandias88,"Dec 16, 2021",9,"This is my favorite Halo game by 343 easily and one of my favorite Halo games in general up there with Halo Reach and CE when it comes to the campaign. The game plays great, it's extremely fun, it looks gorgeous, the story is very good so far (waiting to see what else 343 will add to it) the music is beautiful, overall it's a great campaign. My only two negative points are a) the environment can be repetitive and b) some dialogues from The Weapon end up becoming cringy at points.

As for the multiplayer it's *the* most fun Halo MP i've ever played, it's addictive. There still need to be some additions with more playlists and modes and i know they'll come but the core gameplay is amazing and that's what matters the most to me. The thing that irks me right now is the aggressive monetization. I get that the game is f2p but people still pay $60 for the campaign and having to spend hundreds of dollars extra for some armor sets that existed in Reach and aren't even that special is a bad decision to me. I hope 343 will make more stuff to be earnable through gameplay."
JustGavin,"Dec 15, 2021",10,"Great campaign and story
core gameplay is 10/10
multiplayer is fun but is currently lackluster with modes
but all together this is a great addition to the halo franchise
grapple hook is now iconic"
olokinhu32,"Dec 15, 2021",10,"Simply amazing! This game reminded me in some aspects of halo 3, my favorite one. The forerunner's buildings are beautiful and well thinked, even thought repetitive. Best shooting system in all halo, amazing multiplayer and skins. Some bosses like Chak Lok' and Tremonius could be more founded in the story of the game. In general, a no amazing game, amazing graphics and can't stop playing."
Halonut24,"Dec 15, 2021",9,"The foundation of Halo Infinite is phenomenal. Weapon balance is very nicely tuned, with some minor tweaks required. Gunplay is fantastic. Movement feels comfortable. It's what most of us expected Halo 4 to feel like. A true evolution of the Halo formula.
Now, there's a fair bit of issues, though they are not inherent problems with the game's foundation, like Battlefield 2042's or Call of Duty: Vanguard's. It's the little things 343 is getting wrong. Terrible monetization, and at launch, there's not a whole lot of maps and modes. The silver lining is that 343 also listens to the playerbase, so changes the community wants can absolutely be lobbied for.

The Campaign, to save spoilers, is wonderful. NPC dialogue is easily the best in the series. Even without the IWHBYD skull, the enemy relentlessly heckles you. And the Marines you pick up treat the Banished in kind. Fixing the issues of 343's past Halo installments, ammunition is plentiful. Not obnoxiously abundant, but it allows you to commit to a favored weapon quite often, so you can play the whole campaign with really any weapon of your choice. The physics and new abilities are so much fun. It creates a whole new level of mastery.
As this game continues to evolve and grow, I hope we can expect more like this, but with the little things gotten right this time around. Here's to 10 fruitful years of Infinite!"
New-mombasa,"Dec 15, 2021",10,"For me is a 10/10 game because of its amazing gameplay and story. I never played co-op so I don’t mind not having it at launch. I loved the gunplay and the freedom to explore (wish there was more collectable and small puzzles). I hope 343 make the next Halo a bit bigger with more varieties in the environment and things to do. Love to play the next halo in snowy environment, or even under the sea. Please work on making the next Halo as soon as possible."
bradyjohnson96,"Dec 15, 2021",9,Halo is back. multiplayer is awesome and the campaign thus far has been very exciting with great visuals and story. a good combination of old halo while introducing new ideas as well.

CashMunnie7679,"Dec 15, 2021",9,"I would have rated the game a 10 if the coop was released on day one and if the progression in the multi was good. Otherwise the multiplayer is the best I've ever played. The campain is a blast, my one complaint there is that the new ""AI Cortana"" is really annoying. I know that's on purpose to a point, but still. Otherwise the most fun I've had gaming in a long time."
GameLabs2,"Dec 15, 2021",9,"From my time with halo the multiplayer its amazing and the campaign is great, graphics are fine one of the best halos"
LoompyTV,"Dec 15, 2021",8,"Gameplay is smooth, art style is definitely what the community wanted and whilst it doesn't have the most realistic graphics, textures and bump maps look nice, the game is pretty optimized (I can't speak for others) and runs extremely smooth. However, where the campaign and Multiplayer play amazing, it felt disappointing hearing the cut out content for both, missing armor for multiplayer, and lack of biomes in campaign, not to mention there are no armor unlocks for multiplayer found through the campaign, only paints. And you can only get armor and such through the battlepass or the shop. I enjoy the core aspects of the game but the customization definitely needs an improvement, along with custom games and more playlists. Future updates will add in Forge, and I would hope more content for campaign and more armor and such in multiplayer."

Sin duda es un juego que se hizo con un gran cariño"

Troyerwolfast,"Dec 15, 2021",10,"El juego está genial, mecánicas y combate mucho más fluido que anteriores entregas, el mundo abierto es hermoso y lo que más me gustó aparte de la mecánica del Arpón, es el sistema de puestos de avanzada para poder equipar las armas que más gustes o te den ventaja para cada misión, armas que debes ir consiguiendo en misiones secundarias"
Loupot1,"Dec 15, 2021",10,"Great graphics and superb gameplay,very addictive,just play **** won't be disappointed."
Just_A-Casual,"Dec 15, 2021",6,"The multiplayer on this game is top tier, this is the best multiplayer I've played in years.

Sadly, the campaign is a massive let-down. I'm used to flagship exclusives being perfectly polished and feeling like a finished game. I'm sorry to say, but Infinite's campaign doesn't feel finished. There is nothing breathtaking about the graphics, they are pretty poor for a next gen flagship supposed system seller. The campaign is very short, and you are basically doing the same thing over and over again. The side missions can be pretty fun once you have unlocked all the vehicles from the FOB bases.

The game is unfinished, you can tell it's not the vision 343 originally were aiming for. No co-op, No different biomes. It's just a boring looking game.  I think covid stunted the development of this game, and it's been rushed out.

I experienced multiple 5second freezes throughout the campaign. Also, another gripe I have with the game is the lack of environmental destruction.  Driving a scorpion tank, and it gets stuck on a tiny tree stump, or it can't even bump up a ledge of a pond. If you are in a vehicle, you might as well just stick to the roads, and driving off-road is just a frustrating experience. They should have made the trees destroyable at least.

I'm hoping they are developing more single player content and eventually finish it. Once that's done, it will be an incredible game.

Single player 6/10
Multiplayer 9/10"
driftler92,"Dec 15, 2021",9,Für mich nahezu perfekt. Packende Story und eine wirklich gut funktionierende Open World.
Skankkunt42,"Dec 15, 2021",10,"I was sceptical at first and didn't expect much. I remembered my first Halo experience back in 2001, getting **** in the action, the music, wanting to play more.... I did not expect that and boy was i wrong!! Right from the start you get blasted with amazing visuals, intense story, great voice overs and powerfull gameplay!  You don't get **** into the action, you get slamed into it! You start up the game and the story grabs you and that is what it is all about."

cmonard,"Dec 15, 2021",9,"Mon verdict sur cet Infinite (fini en 20h30 en héroïque)...
Globalement j'ai beaucoup apprécié le jeu, j’ai cru un moment ne pas avoir le récit entre Guardian et celui-ci, mais ce fut résumé (très succinctement malheureusement) durant la campagne

Ce qui est perfectible :
- la différenciation des éléments (caisse / stockage) fait et non fait (gris clair vs gris c’est pas top) sur la map
- pas assez d’ennemie répartie sur la map (a mon goût)
- pas de rejouabilité (pour le moment) des missions
- indication des nouveaux élément débloqué dans le multi inexistant
- les soldats qui sont relativement abrutis dans les camps de base
- les combats en mode ""libre"" moins stressant que ceux durant les missions (de part la taille de la map et la facilité à sniper à outrance)
- Les graphisme parfois vraiment pas top
- un peu trop d'armes au sol et globalement partout, c'est rare d'être totalement à court de munition

Mais j’ai adoré :
- Cortana v2 et son caractère naïf et innocent
- Les répliques des grognards (et globalement tous les ennemies)
- l’IA qui cherche à te contourner pour te mettre en pression durant les combats
- l’Histoire (forcement)
- les boss fight plutôt costaud et intense (vu qu’ils sont tous 3 fois plus rapide que nous et surtout bien plus costaud)
- ce sentiment de satisfaction à chaque fois qu’on fini une épreuve un peu beaucoup tendu
- ... les chasseurs…. (qui te file ce sentiment de : ""ho putain pas eux"") :)
- des secrets..... vraiment bien caché
- des clins d'oeil excellent :)
- Les capacités de move apporté par le grappin et les propulseurs
- la variétés des armes et leur capacité à mettre à mal les ennemies en étant plus ou moins efficace suivant qui se trouve en face (et ne pas oublier qu'on ne porte que 2 armes) le switch est donc primordial avec les armes trouvé à terre tout en continuant d'esquiver les nombreuses attaques

Je n'ai rencontré qu'un seul bug de son durant toute la campagne lors d'une fin de mission à transition (mais enchainement sur le lore où la sauvegarde à été effectué, donc j'ai juste eu a reboot le jeu).

Sans conteste le jeu à faire en cette fin d'années"
StarlessKing,"Dec 15, 2021",5,"Halo Infinite, a pesar de los recortes que sufrió, es un juego en el cuál puedes pasar horas sin tocar la trama principal, es un mundo que en un mapa se ve pequeño pero el estar allí, explorarlo, ver, descubrir, puedes perderte por horas.

La historia principal es maravillosa ya que se vuelve a tocar un punto olvidado de Halo y es la humanidad del Jefe Maestro, se explora su parte humana a la vez que nos enfrentamos contra los desterrados y aunque estos no son muy difíciles individuales en comparación de otras entregas de Halo, un mal paso y estás acabado, el sonido, el movimiento todo me pareció un deleite y un regreso a las raíces del juego e incluyendo cosas nuevas, es un juego que deberías definitivamente probar."

You've seen about 90% of what this game has to offer in the first hour or so. It is definitely better than Halo 5, but there have been several better shooters released this year. There is a lot missing from previous Halo releases that should have been included at the start. For having an extra year for development, this should have been the best shooter of the year.

Kreege,"Dec 14, 2021",3,"People have there own opinions but man how we've lowered our expectations especially when it comes to a triple A exclusive AND Xboxs first born pride and joy.  Multi player hits all the notes and a little more. The campaign on the other hand. That's just sad, the cheap holographic narrative exposition played out in random hallways to move the plot along. That is lazy in every way imaginable and indefensible. At that point they figured eff it let's just have ""echos""(more holograms of Cortana"") play randomly in random locations. Then take a second to realize the game design is made of probably 50 things. What I mean is they designed  banished boxes & weapon racks, grass, trees rocks, three identical forerunner interiors, unsc boxes an weapon racks and that's it. Prove me wrong."
Fausch1234,"Dec 14, 2021",10,Halo Infinite builds on all the best of what the franchise has to offer. The semi open world allows for greater exploration and creativity. This is the most fun I've had with Halo.
Gyer,"Dec 14, 2021",7,"Unlike Halo 4 and 5, Halo Infinite has GREAT multiplayer gunplay, 343's closest version of Halo to Bungie's pinnacle that was Halo Reach.
Unfortunately, the elephant in the room almost ruins all of this great work. 343's monetisation policy on Halo Infinite is shocking, and makes the game feel like Raids Shadow Legends!
Almost every single customisation option costs money, and what's worse, 90% of all battle pass items that you earn, you can't actually use because only ""Premium"" users can unlock them!!!
Shocking way to treat their players, the battle pas is just a massive cash grab. If not for the terrible monetisation, this would have got a 9/10 from me any day of the week."

DustyKhan,"Dec 14, 2021",10,"Probablemente el mejor juego de la saga, por fin 343 ha entendido lo que hizo especial a Halo desde sus principios, tal vez en el online flaquea en ciertos puntos pero nada que no se pueda resolver.
Por fin regresó el ambiente místico y en cierto grado ""santo"" del anillo, el tono militar y de ficción muy bien balanceados, las mejoras del Jefe son de las mejores mecánicas que se pudieron añadir, aunque el 90% del juego usas únicamente el gancho son una vuelta a lo que Halo 3 proponía, pero mejor implementado.
El apartado gráfico es espectacular, incluso en consolas de pasada generación la calidad de las texturas y efectos es un logro técnico tener esa calidad en Xbox One fat y S, no quiero imaginar como se ve el juego en Series o PC.
Si tengo una queja sería con el online, pero para mí lo más importante en Halo siempre ha sido el singleplayer, que ha sido magnífico en esta ocasión."

Pros:
1. Fun from beginning to end

5. Level design is good, with each different base offering new ways to tackle the challenges ahead.
6. Most bosses are fun to fight.
7. By straying from the linearity of previous titles, you get to create your own memorable set pieces in every engagement, as the game can be very unpredictable and many challenges can be tackled in vastly different ways.

Cons:
1. Some bosses are repetitive and annoying, especially in harder difficulty settings. 2. The story could be better, leaving a lot of unanswered questions by the end after trying to build up some characters for weak pay off.
3. There’s a lack of diverse biomes to explore and enemy variety.
4. Side quests are also lacking in pay off in the narrative side. 5. FOBs are very repetitive. 6. Some weapon types leave a lot
To be desired as far as their value vs some of the classic human weapon options. 7. Main antagonist is very lame with no real plan of action, and nowhere near being a good adversary for the master chief. Neutral:
1. The new characters are hit or miss. Sometimes they’re fun and deliver good performances, and sometimes they’re annoying and deliver cringey dialogue. I think how much you enjoy them will be based on how immersed you are in the game and the lore.

The game is a solid 8 / 10 to me, and I’m hoping we get dlc soon with new areas, new enemy types and addition to the plot that fixes its flaws in the main campaign. If you’re a fan of halo games or just like fps campaign games, definitely give this game a chance.

P.S. the multiplayer is very fun and addicting, specially with friends, but the cosmetics **** a lot and the battle pass progression system (as of the time of this writing) are very bad, even after changes that give more xp every day."

You get a first in class FPS in terms of quality and a remastered or reborn version of when Halo was living it's best life. This game is ridiculously fun and very hard to put down.

letterse7en,"Dec 14, 2021",9,"When Bungie started this franchise, it felt like hit after hit and each Halo release was an event and was special.  Then Bungie with their own way to start Destiny and since then, Halo just hasn't been the same.  343 struggled to match what Bungie had done so well for so many years and never really knocked it out of the park with a great halo game...until now.  343 has finally done it and proved that the 1 year delay was the right thing to do.

I was in my early 20's when the first Halo launched.  Playing Halo for the first time was magical and really took first-person shooters to another level.  Halo Infinite creates that same feeling I had 20 years ago.  I truly feel reconnected to the franchise again.  Infinite gives you a new world to explore and exploration is a rewarding experience in this game.  Going off the beaten path, you're sure to find easter eggs and random encounters while picking up collectibles along the way.  Infinite takes the open-world experience and connects everything you do and everything you find to create a complete experience for the player.  What I mean by that is that so many open-world games I've played in the past have repetitive tasks and side jobs to do in each region and often it becomes tedious and not very rewarding in the end.  While there are many side tasks that are repetitive such as rescuing a group of marines, or destroying coms towers, finding audio logs, hunting high-value targets, etc. None of it feels tedious or overly repetitive.  Every one of theses tasks rewards you for your efforts.  Some of these tasks give you valuable information that adds color to the story, others give you upgrades to Master Chief's, weapon variants, mods to the gameplay, some unlock more vehicles or weapons you can deploy at one of the many bases in the game. Some give you cosmetic items to customize your spartan in multiplayer.  Everything you do rewards you with something that will enhance your gameplay.

This game does an amazing job of blending everything that was memorable about past halo experiences, while adding so many new things from gadgets, to vehicles to guns in an open-world setting that is so much fun to explore.  My only gripe is that coop isn't available.  I can already imagine how much fun it will be to team up with a friend or a group of friends and play through this open world together.  It truly is a blast and anyone who wants an incredible halo experience should give this a look if you haven't already."
Kenmei,"Dec 14, 2021",8,"This review covers only the single player campaign. This is easily 343's best Halo campaign they've ever made. The grappling hook combined with the new open world map works perfectly together and adds a new dimension to gameplay that I didnt know Halo ever needed but works so well together. While the new open world map is fairly small and limited in what it can do, the amount of stuff in that map is quite large and completing the map is fun and never gets too repetitive. The story falls short though as its left with the task of finishing off the convoluted Halo 5 campaign but also acting as a reset point for the series as a whole. The game badly needed a recap cinematic or something though as I was completely lost as to what was initially happening in the opening cutscene. The ending is very hit or miss as the new main bad guy(s) are never really given enough time on screen to establish their motives for doing what they are doing. It's not terrible but really needed another couple of villain centric cutscenes to establish the threat. However, the more blatant issue is that the game released without single player co-op and the ability to replay missions. This is easily one of the biggest complaints I have with the entire game as it feels incomplete and with the earliest that the co-op will be released being next summer, that's inexcusable for a Halo game on launch. I'd still recommend it for anyone who may have been turned off by Halo 5 and the issues that game had, but know that the game isn't complete as is and wont be till next summer."

Xbox_Alive,"Dec 14, 2021",10,"Halo Infinite! Who has never heard of this cult series whose first opus was released on November 15, 2001 on the first Xbox of Microsoft? Its hero, the Spartan John-117 is actually cited among the greatest video game characters aka Master Chief. So when Halo Infinite was announced at the E3 2018, it's fair to say that the fans couldn't stand still! After a first failed gameplay presentation on July 23, 2020 at the Xbox Games Showcase (mostly because of the quality of graphics) 343 Industries announced the postponement of the game for 2021. Since then, the studio has been joined by others such as the Canadians from SkyBox Labs, the Californians from Sperasoft, and the Texas studio Certain Affinity, which is involved in the multiplayer part of the title. But let's stop talking about it, because it's time for the verdict on Halo Infinite! One thing is certain: Halo Infinite is off to a great start! The long introduction of the game (that is to say before you find yourself on the surface of the ring) is indeed quite intense and is full of action and epic scenes. Our first steps with the Major make our mouths water and also allow us to set the story, which takes place six months after the events of Halo 5. Right from the start, Master Chief is beaten (yes, you read that right!) to a pulp by a particularly strong Brute leader aboard the UNSC Infinity. The Major is blown into space and drifts for a while, until a Pelican piloted by a lost Infinity crew member picks up his signal and saves him. With only his courage, and the help of a new AI, 117 will go to the nearby Halo Zeta to defeat the Pariahs, a rebel faction already seen in Halo Wars. A mission that seems to hide another one since Cortana (the old AI that accompanied the Major during all his past adventures) seems to speak about her in different ways and seems to hold a rather important role in the story. And then what is this new threat that seems to surpass that of the parasite? Coming closer to the first opus and to the original vision of Bungie's Halo, this new episode is thought as a ""new first Halo"" according to the words of creative director Joseph Staten. And the least we can say is that this is really felt in game. The impression of being faced with a revisited Halo: Combat Evolved is strong, and the fans of the first hour will undoubtedly be over the moon! However, Halo Infinite does not forget that we are in 2021, because it brings with it a fluid gameplay and a new useful equipment: the grapple launcher. If during the first presentation we had doubts about the relevance of such an object in a Halo, we must admit that these doubts are swept away. Even better, the Spartan can hang on with this grappling hook almost anywhere, giving the adventure an exhilarating and welcome feeling of freedom in the series. Enjoying a handling at the limit of perfection, the player takes very easily in hand our hero and manages to quickly chain the moments of bravery, by catapulting himself for example in height to play the sniper or by catching explosive coils that he can send on enemies. A grappling hook can also be used to grab opponents to come and put a good shot between their teeth! The artificial intelligence is also very well worked out, with clever enemies who don't hesitate to go around you or to shoot an explosive coil near you!  In short, we won't beat around the bush, the gameplay of Halo Infinite is a success and largely surpasses that of all the other episodes. With its map divided into three large areas, this Halo is an open-world game. In the field, the Major will have main and secondary mission objectives. However, don't expect a wide variety of secondary objectives. As in most open-world games, they are indeed quite classic and consist in capturing bases, saving allies, destroying towers or killing priority targets. However, the studio manages to make everything more dynamic and to integrate a new system that rewards the player for completing objectives: bravery points. The more points you have, the more powerful vehicles you can use in the bases, the better equipped marines you can count on and the more powerful weapons you can use. Wait, what are you still doing here? This game is the game we've all been waiting for check it out on gamepass or buy it if you are like me and have to catch 'em all like Pokemon! The only way you're going to be disappointed with this is if you never liked halo or are trying to find a reason to not enjoy yourself. Brilliant, biggest campaign to date by far!"

Venq,"Dec 14, 2021",9,"A very enjoyable and memorable campaign. It builds on the series' strengths and adds new layer of combat with equipments. Despite some parts feeling a bit like a drag, the campaign still manages to overcome its shortcomings by mixing everything up nicely. Above all, it sets up the perfect launchpad for the next ten years and if 343i manages to build on this foundation, they will soon reach the highest of highs that the series has ever reached. Time will tell how they capitalize on this."

EdgeLord420,"Dec 13, 2021",5,"The core gameplay in the multiplayer is good, however due to a lack of server selection features, players outside of the US including myself are getting 150-200 ping on a regular basis. I haven't had a single ranked game below 120 ping (South East Asian servers), and its often well above 150. This is unacceptable, and makes the game almost unplayable and definitely not fun at all. I'll  accept that the monetization aspect of things seems to be improving. The campaign was enjoyable, and I'm excited to see what comes next. Too bad multiplayer is unfair and laggy due to 343 prioritising finding a game in 10 seconds over people having a fair and competitive experience.

Sillybear,"Dec 13, 2021",5,"Halo Infinite's campaign seems like a sequel to a game we never got, with 343 Industries opting to ride the fence between sequel to Halo 5: Guardians and reboot, making for a jarringly disconnected experience that never really seems to pick up or go anywhere interesting. The open world is reminiscent of a Far Cry title, proving a mildly interesting distraction that stops being so rather quickly. The grappling hook, being pushed as the game's staple ability, is fun and satisfying to use, leading to some intense flanks and getaways that wouldn't be possible in previous titles. However, it seems as if the enemy AI doesn't quite know how to counter it effectively, enabling you to simply fly past large swaths of enemies with barely a scratch to show for it. Boss fights, which return from Halo 2, either seem too easy or punishingly hard, with 343 unable to find that golden balance. And of course, I can't forget to mention the egregious omission of co-op at launch, making players wait at least another half year before it will finally be patched in. Perhaps the promised future DLC stories will prove more engaging, but personally, I believe that the vanilla campaign is a rather mediocre experience overall, and not intriguing enough to warrant subsequent playthroughs, let alone the $60 USD asking price. If you feel obligated to play it, however, I'd say it is worth the $9.99 Game Pass asking price on your platform of choice.

On the multiplayer side, things are a bit of a mess at the moment. While the return to boots-on-the-ground arena-focused gameplay is a welcome one, the initial release of content is shockingly sparce for a game that was in development for six years. Several playlists that were absent from the game at launch, such as Slayer and SWAT (now being referred to as ""Tactical Slayer""), are set to be added tomorrow at the time of this review, but only after mass user outcry on social media and repeated botched communication from 343 Industries. Other issues, such as the horrific monetization practices, a very lackluster customization system, and lack of a primary progression system are significantly worse than any previous entry in the franchise and are unlikely to be fixed any sooner than a year or longer at the very least. Other systems, such as Theater and the UI as a whole, are very poorly implemented and confusing to navigate, with Theater frequently malfunctioning or being unable to play previous films entirely. Forge, introduced in 2007's Halo 3, is yet another mode that was cut from the game, and is being targeted for Q3 2022 at the earliest, which is approaching nearly an entire year after release. Once again, overall the entire experience feels half-baked and poorly planned despite the lengthy development period and undoubtedly large budget allotted by publisher Microsoft.

I would not recommend Halo Infinite at this time, as it seems like a game that requires at least a year or two of patching to become a fully-featured product, much like DICE's Battlefront II some years prior. Unfortunately, it seems that 343 Industries is still incapable at providing a solid day one experience, even after a decade of working on the Halo franchise. Perhaps one day Halo Infinite will be worthy of the hundreds and even thousands of hours that have been put into its predecessors, but until that time comes, stay far away."
italo998,"Dec 13, 2021",10,"it's really a really amazing experience, after halo 5 i thought the 343 couldn't make a good halo game... but they shut my mouth"
Mitti_tax,"Dec 13, 2021",10,"Not as good as Halo 3, but let’s be honest, nothing will ever be.

We need to stop living and looking back to the past, and expect new and modern games to take us through the exact same emotional roller coaster we were taken on from game titles that had many years and multiple installations that built those moments.

Halo Infinite won’t play like Doom Eternal, because it’s Halo game, and not Doom."
skippiskip,"Dec 13, 2021",9,"I don't know how to explain it, but for the campaign side of things, this may be the second-best Halo game, if not first. The story was emotional and really pays off for players who have played all of the games before this one because there are literally callbacks to EVERY Halo game; from easter eggs to pivotal plot points. You actually see what Guardians are capable of, and you get an explanation visually of what happened from Halo 5 to the beginning of Infinite, to where Infinite picks up 6 months after the beginning. Boss fights seem a little unfair, but they're beatable, and I played on normal difficulty, but it seemed harder than most other normal difficulties I've played. Probably a second normal playthrough I'll be able to tackle heroic difficulty. I do think that Halo Infinite falls for a few issues other open-world games fall for. Difficulty varies, and your fun factor will change from the direction you choose to attack locations. Also, some enemies feel too bullet-spongy. With the story, you might get a little lost at the beginning, but everything is explained in the last third of the story.

On the multiplayer side, it's a mixed bag. Regarding gameplay, solid. Very solid, no issues. Weapons are a mixed bag. Most alien weapons are weak, excluding the sentinal beam, needler, skewer, and mauler. Don't use any other alien weapon. The plasma pistol was nerfed, and there are not enough variety of weapons. Wished there were so much more. Vehicles feel off. There more...unhandy than before. Instead of vehicles having weird physics being a feature, this is more of a problem. The maps are very good. Customization looks cool, but because of how the progression system works, you might as well not bother customizing your spartan without paying loads of money.

The campaign is a must-play, and the multiplayer is something you might like. I like it, and I'm not much of a multiplayer guy."

Кроме стрельбы, которая после destiny1 не удивляет ничем и не цепляет, в игре ничего интересного.

Мир пустой, стерильный. Мобы конечно хорошо уворачиваются, стреляют и кидают гранаты, но на этом и всё. Зачистил аванпост, послушал по сюжету диалог (ничем не примечательный), дневник, и побрел дальше. Игра пока ничем не держит, чтоб не спать и играть дальше и дальше.

Графика, еслиб не 60-120fps это хуже стартовых проектов прошлого поколения. Довольно средненький killzone shadowfall со старта ps4 выглядит лучше в разы.
Как так на самой мощной консоли уже текущего поколения - хз. Удивительно.

Игру пройду, но максимум 7 из 10, если и концовка будет как вся игра - то ещё пол балла можно смело снять.

Yoginsock,"Dec 13, 2021",9,"Multiplayer is super fun, gameplay is solid, the power ups (grapple, repulsor, booster) are super fun and add great depth to gameplay. The campaign is solid, the open world is cool but kind of empty once you finish the campaign. the story missions themselves are pretty fun, some of the wave by wave battles can be pretty mundane, but the boss fights are super fun. The story itself is pretty good aswell although I do have a couple of problems of how they handle the plot threads left behind by the abismell last game. The banished are super cool but the Harbringer is kind of a confusing addition that is ultimatly unresolved at the end. But it does make me excited to see what comes next."

Nightgoat,"Dec 13, 2021",9,"Halo going open world was a bold move that works surprisingly well. It’s not perfect and a few tweaks are needed to put it over the top but as it is, it’s a very fun experience. The combat reminds me of Doom Eternal. Stand around during a firefight and you will die. Over and over. Ammo is always nearby during battles and most of the time you will be looking for it in between killing grunts. It keeps you on your toes! The graphics are sharp but not the prettiest game on the new generation consoles. I hope you enjoy the forests and mountains because that’s what you’ll be seeing about 95% of the game. Halo Infinite definitely needs some new biomes added to kill some of the redundancy, but for now, I’m really enjoying the scenery. In short, Halo Infinite is a lot of fun. 9 out of 10. With some updates, it could easily be rated perfect."

Yun1t0,"Dec 13, 2021",10,"After playing Halo Infinite, (finished Campaign & about 80-90hrs on MP) I can say, without a doubt that it’s the best Halo ever made IMO, & it gets from me a 10 (I would've given it a 9.8 if allowed bc the campaign has some (not a lot) pop-in issues & the MP playlists aren't ideal. But I think those are things they're already working on so a it gets a 10 from me. The gameplay is amazing and after I finished the game on legendary now I plan to play it again for collectibles on Heroic & I am actually looking forward to play a game I just finished a second time for collectibles which trust me isn't something I do at all except with games I love (mass effect trilogy comes to mind). The story is really good and the pacing is great. You just get lost doing everything and it is always fun. The multiplayer is incredible too, and they're about to put new (and better) playlists since that was the thing they needed to fix. Do yourself a favor and play this game, use gamepass if youre not sure about it but give it a try, it is worth it!"

The fact that they made the banished the main villain of halo now instead of hell idk the FLOOD or wait for it CORTANA is just disgusting! Played through the whole damn game to find out that they choose  this as the new way for halo is just sad! Five ended in such a way that you could've had an amazing story like 3 did. Giant battle against Cortana then the flood show up from wherever and then it's a huge battle between them. Instead we get this cliffhanger and a hell of alot more questions than answers. Just compete trash!

They offer them an incomplete and bad cheesy game."
ecks0,"Dec 13, 2021",10,"This is what Halo in 2021 is supposed to be. 343 listened to their base and went back to the roots of what made Halo great. Faced with backlash of Halo 4 and 5(mainly 5), this was their final straw to make things right. If they didn't, they would've lost their base forever. The multiplayer gameplay is absolutely phenomenal. The best it's ever been in Halo. The progression system needs ALOT of work, but that'll come in due time. 343 is doing a good job communicating to the community and making changes, which is great to see. I'd give the MP maybe a 7-8 currently, it would be a 10 if they went back to Reach's progression system. The Campaign though.... story wise, its great, not as good as Halo 1 or 2, but its the best halo campaign ive played in more than a decade. The open world works, I was skeptical at first, but with the implementation of the grapple hook and other abilities, it absolutely transformed what this campaign is and what it can be with some DLC's. Campaign is a 10/10, solely from a gameplay and enjoyment perspective. It's been a while to where I could actually have multiple playthroughs of a campaign, maybe since 2015 when The Witcher 3 came out. This came could potentially last years without losing much of the base if they pump out DLC's. Keep it up 343."
Diehl2076,"Dec 13, 2021",9,The gameplay is so refreshing and nostalgic at the same time. There are plenty of issues for 343 to iron out but the upcoming playlist update is a much needed step in that direction. Campaign is a blast!

And the campaign is the perfect match between lined up phases with open world activities. Wheter you are a Halo veteran or a newbie (like me), this game will lock you in for hours of great fun. However, some things must be improved. For instance, cross platform multiplayer should be optional to protect console players against pc cheaters. Also, the game needs a recap animation for whatever has happened in the previous games (something like Mass Effect 3 did would be great!). Halo Infinity is an easy game to recommend."

AshSFPN,"Dec 13, 2021",9,"Halo Infinite has an incredible story and gameplay. It’s a great game, awesome, but there are some flows.

In campaign, you suddenly get marines in your bases. This should be a little more explained, you are told that UNSC forces have been hunted but then you have infinite marines out of nowhere. And there are still lots of questions of the blue team, Osiris and the spirit of fire. Then, in the mission of entering a tower after gathering data of three bases, you have to forcibly complete the campaign doing 3 missions in a row with no way to stop and keep exploring the ring. You are forced to complete the campaign. I would have liked to complete that mission and then do a little exploration, but no. This little flaws make the game not as much perfect as I wanted, but the gameplay is the most fun of any halo. It’s a great game, but I’m  hoping some free campaign DLC’s"

Dz8725,"Dec 12, 2021",9,They made this game mostly with the fans in mind and it shows! As an old school halo fan playing it on my first xbox when I was 10 and playing every game over and over and over since then I'm for the most part satisfied with the direction 343 went with this. The story is really good and I've been having a lot of fun with the multi-player. Just wish co op was released and the store was better and the battle pass was way better. Unsure if not having the choice to chose what mode you play in multi-player is simply because you're trying to get a good amount of data collected on all game modes or what but not having that ability also ****.  The game itself is great I love every thing about it the story was such a major step up from 4 and definitely 5.  I even teared up a little bit.. but do to the fact that it's  lacking key features is why I gave it a 9 out 10.

SchroederRock,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"Having spent about 25 or so hours on the campaign, nearly full completing it and seeing the stage set for what comes next, I can confidently say this is the best Halo. I'll summarize the look, feel, execution of the game as absolutely solid. No major or hardly even minor bugs to speak of. The game is ultra-smooth and I have a feeling that the extra year 343 got to take on the game really allowed this game to launch with most of its core features in-tact (campaign, multiplayer, online features/store). But what I really want to express is my love for the campaign - the story told. I was a little frustrated that the gap between Halo 5 and Infinite from a story point was so janky. I knew a little bit of what was going on by watching some lore videos that connect the events leading into this game but felt that the game itself did a poor job of setting the stage and making me really care about what's going on - or even just know what's going on. It ended up working out. The storytelling is intentional and you get most of the picture through clever narrative choices, objects in the game that unfold the major plot progression from the moments Halo 5 conclude to where you end up in Halo Infinite.

I will refrain from spoilers but the entire conclusion is masterful - this is the BEST Halo story ever told. I wish the best for 343 and where they go from here with a story that seems to be finishing but not yet totally finished. Play the campaign, listen to the story, see where you think things end up. It was beautifully done and finally served Master Chief with some believable vulnerability and puts a bow on a major plotline that has persisted through 5 Halo games. I loved every minute of it and Infinite makes me feel like 343 finally figured out how to make a Halo game that's theirs.

My complaints are near-zero. I don't think the Slipspace Engine that Infinite was built using is quite as good as I had hoped. I feel like the option to rely on Halo 3 visual art was maybe too much lip-service to Halo fans. I'm a core Halo fan, been playing since the first game debuted, and I would have been happy to see 343 take a few steps forward for immersion via graphics. If you've seen what a few screenshots looked like using the Unreal Engine (search for it online) you'll see what I mean - there's something about a more realistic version of Halo that made me wish the Slipsplace Engine delivered that kind of visual entertainment. It's kinda nit-picky though and I still feel this is by-far the best-looking Halo ever, both because of its 4K delivery AND it's fantastic HDR delivery - the lighting is amazing.

My other light complaint is the fact that the campaign space clearly rips off Far Cry. Not a bad thing - it was a fun time experiencing Far Cry but in a Halo setting, but I hope 343 thinks through their open-world delivery (it's clearly not the end of this format) as the things you do on the side present as mostly unimportant. They do drag out the campaign experience by many hours on Normal to around 30 hours, which is awesome in my opinion. I only wish there was even more content to work through that would push it beyond that. I will only have Legendary to attempt some day, but that'll be for another time. Halo Infinite is about as good as it could have been.

My other nit-picky issue, and it's minor,"

darksage75,"Dec 12, 2021",10,Best Halo ever. The campaign is everything that Halo always wanted to be and the Multiplayer is just the perfect game to play online with your friends. 10/10.
Kiranraj_ae,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Amazing game, especially if you like good AIs. Grunt is hilarious, could just hear them talk all day as they are so funny and spontaneous.  Such an amazing game. Will play it again when they release Coop."

Kudlak-Sin,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"I am once again blinded by it's majesty.

Halo is arguably one of the best series of all time inspired by all sci-fi material that came before and an inspiration to those that came after its release.

We've come a long way in these 20 years since Combat Evolved first released and this makes me feel so happy I am about to cry.

This game is an incredible return to roots in its game play, and a beautiful new beginning in its campaign.

PROS:
+ Plays and looks like a Halo game should
+ Buttery Smooth gunplay
+ Great visuals
+ Well designed sensitivity across both KB+M and controller
+ The gameplay is fun now that 343 is finally striking a balance between what came before and incorporating what they had learned from Halo 5 to create a more tactical take on the old arena style of game we're all used to
+ The utilitarian art style is back, no more skin tight suits with armor bits glued to it
+ Sound design is crisp, impactful. The BR is one of the best sounding guns in any fps game.
+ Music, for what little exists in the multiplayer portion, is really good and I'm happy to see electric guitars return to Halo in some capacity. This beats the droning noises and ambient sounds Halo 4  multiplayer called ""music"" whenever it was featured
+Guns: The guns in this game are marvelously well crafted and balanced!

CONS:
+ Strange to outright terrible battle pass progression
+ Lack of playlists
+ Prone to crashing and freezing

Thankfully all of these things I've mentioned can be ironed out in a few patches, which is why I'm still recommending it. It needs a bit of work, but Infinite is looking bright."

The gunplay in multiplayer and campaign is amazing, making you feel like a 8 foot tall Spartan. Especially in Campaign with all your abilities. Multiplayer is fun and addicting to play with friends. Only thing holding this game back is the lack of launch content for multiplayer and the horrible progression system and greedy shop."

Splist,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"Multiplayer is kind of whack but im having the most fun in the campaign that ive had since red dead 2, if you have the chance PLEASE play the campaign, It does lose some points from the lack of splitscreen and no online co-op out of the box though, i was looking forward to play with my friends.
to the reviews stating the campaign leaves you wanting more thats kind of the point on the expanding universe halo is set in, there will be more that come out.

95% of the negative reviews are from review bombs from playstation fans or people with computers not up to par with minimum requirements.

spacejim,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Halo Infinite is exactly the Halo it needed to be. 343 have distilled the sandbox action, gunplay and irreverence that made Halo such a powerful franchise and modernised it to a polished sheen. The multiplayer is addictive, fair, and balanced, while the campaign tells an intimate story on a grand stage. The campaign walks a line of reinvigorating the franchise while staying true to its canon, and while it may be a scaled-back version of what was first envisaged, what is there is simply excellent. Halo has a bright future ahead."
Lymed,"Dec 12, 2021",8,"To keep it brief, Halo infinite made me fall in love with halo all over again. The campaign, was fantastic and has me eagerly awaiting a potential expansion or sequel, and theorizing where the series could go from here. And the multiplayer has been a blast to play through, and I’ve never cared for multiplayer. While it is painfully lacking in multiple areas with plans to expand the game and it’s offering for years to come, what is here is nothing short of excellent, and I can not wait to see what’s to come"

AlexandersonJD,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"This is solely based on the campaign, but base on the quality it probably it the best halo game and story. Now its not going to win best narrative or be hailed as a art piece, it's still halo, but what 343 did is add enough character work to give the big moments in the story a lot of emotion, to the point where the end game can be pretty emotion for longtime fans. Steve Downes and Jen Taylor really elevated this story beyond its simple ""find the girl"" style story, to the point where Jen Taylor's performance should be first on the list of 2022 best performances. However, I don't think this story will work as well without playing Halo 1-3 and getting the relationship between Chief, Cortana, and the new AI Weapon. But if you play Halo for the campaign this is probably the best in terms of quality.

Mechanically its about as tight as an arena shooter can get (I played on console so unsure how PC feels to play) I dipped a bit into multiplayer so if you like that you'll like PvE. I will say there is one boss fight nearing the end of the game that felt more frustrating then fun, but the enemy design and AI were pretty fun to play against.

The biggest thing about the ""game"" aspect of it is the length feels artificially long. While I thought the side missions and the valor points earned form them was a fun addition (despite being a bit repetitive) the main missions are on the shorter end of a Halo game and the layout and goals feel different enough to make up for that, if you blitz through it, I think there will be some disappointment.

Running through the last few things, the music still slaps, classics return, new renditions of old songs. This group really understood what made Marty O'Donnell's work become classic.

Tech wise it felt good, I was playing on my day one Xbox one and it run better than I expect a nearly decade old console could run a 2021 game, occasion weird load or frame rate issue but nothing happened twice."
ScareHalo5,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"Halo Infinite is an amazing semi open world game. Everything from the Campaign and even its MP aside from some of the MP aspect side of things. The Pilot, The Weapon, and Master Chief all intertwine themselves together to face off against the mighty Banished on Zeta Halo.

The multiplayer is fun, engaging, &  enjoyable. The only downsides are those that tryhard, and sweat on casual based games, and the still quite egregious BP based customization . Other than that, Halo Infinite is a definite shut up n take my money and a major major major major GO to all of those reading this."

The ai is so good in this games, the grunts are funny as hell, the visuals are really good in places but the open world is also not the best that i have seen. The sound in dolby atmos is very good and the music is also fantastic. This game is one of the best games for me for 2021"
3lM4u900,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"En lo personal me encantan los juegos de Halo y este no es la excepción. Me gustó mucho el hecho de que sea un mundo abierto con misiones independientes de la campaña principal, el poder invertir tiempo en la exploración de este mundo mientras realizamos misiones, y la historia de la campaña es buena y envolvente, el multijugador también tiene sus aciertos ya que es muy entretenido, aunque el hecho de que para personalizar a nuestro Spartan tengamos que pagar más del 95% de las veces deja algo que desear, igualmente esta bien el sistema de personalización del Spartan y de la IA"
lolllllllllll,"Dec 12, 2021",10,Fun game and really has the spirit of the old halo games. The campaign is also amazing especially the open-world part.
Baroon1919,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Es todo lo que nesesitava la franquicia para revivir después de lo que hizo halo 5 con la porquería de historia que plantearon en dicha entrega.

Pd: XGOD por simpre siuuuuu"
justasoldier,"Dec 12, 2021",7,"I'm a huge halo fan, and I was incredibly let down by halo 5. Halo infinite thankfully, for the most part, delivered. The multiplayer is another story. It's pretty good, but connections and MTX need work.

Campaign is not bad. The story is okay I suppose, I do like the character dynamic between the weapon, pilot, and chief a lot. Escharum is a captivating enough antagonist, he feels pretty threatening and like a worthy foe for *the* spartan, but the harbinger is another lame 343 ""twist"" villain that, in my opinion, really lets the story down. Just the banished or introducing more forerunners or maybe even bringing in mendicant bias would have been cooler and less ""huh? why?"" to me. At least they, in my opinion, wrapped up and moved on from halo 5 while still keeping it to the side as sort of an apology to people like me who really didn't like it.

Overall the story is just okay, but the dialogue is some of the best in the series.

The gunplay/gameplay loop I find very satisfying, I think it could use a few more weapons but overall not bad at all, very solid, best in the 343 series.

The enemy variation is, again, just okay. The banished are fun to fight but there aren't enough new enemies in my opinion, no flood, prometheans, and the only forerunner enemies are the drones. Again.

The open world is well done, very beautiful, but not enough wildlife, environments, or different things to do. FOB captures are repetitive, and HVT missions don't feel mechanically diverse enough. There's also not enough collectibles.

Overall I would say halo infinite is worth the money, at least to me, but it still feels unfinished and I'm left wanting more. Maybe check it out in 1-2 maybe even 3 years once we've gotten some story DLC and some QOL improvements."
Luizz01,"Dec 12, 2021",10,Amazing world and amazing history. It's a new start to the saga and it's amazing. The multi-player it's a lot of fun.

Dante09,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"343 has managed to recapture the Halo feeling and refocus Halo's gameplay by focusing less on abilities tied to the player and more pick ups and environmental choices. A simple, yet complex story which also feels like an apology to the community for the misdirection they have gone with the series. Halo finally sounds, feels and plays like Halo, once again."
Jace_Static,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"The game was incredible! Even made me tear up a few times, and the music was a 10/10 incredible soundtrack! Only negatives. Wish the game was rated M. Feel like that would help with the immersion. Second wish that they would use Blur cgi cutscenes from HW2 instead of the in-game engine. I think this would help project certain emotions a little better.

Overall:
Campaign 9/10
MP 10/10
Music 10/10"

CRunkazChris,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"What I've experienced is greatness. I started the game on Legendary difficulty and has been having so much fun. Also I've been in so questioning what has happened since halo 5, what happened to cortana. So far the game looks beautiful and the audio is spot on perfect with my official Xbox headphones with Dolby atmos on series x. Thanks to 343 for this game the wait was worth it. Happy 20 birthday to Halo and Xbox keep the best games coming you guys."

LordNash,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Absolutely incredible. This is a proper Halo game through and through, fit for both old fans and new. This is a true return to form. 343 has managed to create a game that is not only breathtaking in its beauty, but more importantly is fun. Halo Infinite is sheer bliss to play. In every encounter I found myself trying new and unique ways to deal with enemies, often with either fantastic or hilarious results. Don’t bother reading any more reviews - get this game ASAP."

343 has done the game justice."

Rohrteppich95,"Dec 12, 2021",9,A grate Halo game with a perfect combat loop. The Open World though should be a bit smaller with a greater fokus on more variable environments. The story fixes Halo 5s mess of a plot. 343s best Halo.
MeuConsoleBugad,"Dec 12, 2021",10,Halo Infinite brought a feeling to me that I haven't had in a long time. Exploring Zeta Halo took me to the heydays of Combat Evolved but now with a much bigger view. Everything in the game is a pleasure to do. If you're a Halo fan you'll delight in one of the best Halo ever made.

Brucewillis,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"I like how familiar the gameplay feels (classic halo) but at the same time the open world adds another dimension to the replayability of the game. The story is engaging, the classic halo humor is still there, one of the best FPS experiences this year."
NoFace22,"Dec 12, 2021",10,Third time's a charm. It took 343 Industries three times to get it right. Halo Infinite absolutely delivers in both campaign and multi-player. It is so dang fun! Do yourself a favor and give it a try. Don't miss out on Halo's return to form!
Sackzilla1942,"Dec 12, 2021",1,"Halo infinite oh boy where to begin. For better or worse this game breaks tradition and charts a path into a new frontier. The campaign is probably the best 343 has done second best to Halo 4 at times but still pales in comparison with Bungies original trilogy. The big twist this time is the new open world, think silent cartographer but the entire game has that scope behind it. That said it feels a bit barren and that sense of beautifully crafted purposeful levels is gone. You could even say it suffers from Ubisoft syndrome. That said it’s still pretty fun and runs great across a plethora of console and pc set ups.

The multiplayer on the other hand honestly has little to nothing redeeming about it. Thought I must admit the core game play is great. It now a free to play like fortnite or many other current multiplayer offerings. The customization is limited , and any meaningful customization is behind agressive micro transactions, want a unique helmet for your Spartan 20 dollars. Want the color blue 10 dollars.

There is also a battle pass you can buy but again the progression is painful and the only meaningful way of making progression on it is through doing challenges. This challenges harm the game by making it a hassle to level up your battle pass and also as a sideffect forced the game to have a limited playlist out of the users control and solely up to 343.

Honestly I couldn’t recommend anyone purchase the physical full Price item. You gain nothing worthwhile and at malt the campaign is only worth 30 bucks."
chicagog19,"Dec 12, 2021",9,This game is a return to form for Halo. I very much enjoyed that the game focused on Master Chief versus doing the split story of Chief/Locke like in 5. The game is extremely polished and didn't really experience any bugs. The grapple hook added a fun new dimension. I knocked off a point for not having co-op at launch.
Jakeb5500,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"343 yave done a great job reviving the narrative of halo after h5. This is alot better and honestly one of the best halo games.

I mean The Witcher 3 looks better from 2014 I think. 343 industries **** since Part 4, halo lost his magic with this visionless Studio. I've been a fan since Halo 1.

Zerark,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Una gran vuelta de Halo, un gameplay muy dinámico, el gancho que es la mecánica mas nueva del juego solo tiene una cosa mala y es que no quiero otro Halo sin el.

La Campaña es muy buena, acierta en todo lo que falló Halo 5, una buena construcción de personajes, el juego tiene un objetivo de principio a fin dando un verdadero enemigo a vencer, la estética sigue teniendo el toque de 343 pero se mezcla con la clásica y aunque la campaña se un poco corta se siente concluida aunque todavía se dejé abierta para las expansiones que llegaran y espero sean tan buenas como está campaña"
Rabih117,"Dec 12, 2021",9,Love the open world concept in halo. Been playing for 20 years and it's a nice refresh. Music is nostalgic and ganeolay is amazing in campaign and MP. Would have given a 10 but kissing key features like coop campaign etc but otherwise very polished after the 1 year delay.

- corridor fights

- boring collectibles"
FreqMode,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Was really worried when they said it was going to be open world because usually that mean diluted quality over all and generic repetitive enemy encounters but I was pleasantly surprised that infinite still feels like halo, maybe even more like Bungie Halo than 4&5 did especially because there's no promethean trash mobs in it, the most boring Halo enemies of all time. Enjoying it more than I thought I would. Would give it an 8 for lack of launch co op but my 10 is to help offset the salty review bombs and co op will be added eventually anyway."

Around 12+ hours to beat the game (a little longer actually since the clock goes back upon death)."

OdThaGod,"Dec 12, 2021",9,After completing the campaign and completing most of the open world activities i'm confident in saying this is one of if not the best Halo game released to date. Among all its new features it finally feels like it knew what it set out to do and achieved that goal without feeling like it set itself away from what it means to be Halo.
Gardnersj23,"Dec 12, 2021",10,The best Halo since playing Halo 3. They open world is truly an eye opening moment.
names4gainz,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"343 has finally made a good game, the campaign is very refreshing and rivels Reach in quality.
Despite being an open world game your time is never wasted, while there is some repetition in tasks generally it's shaken up enough to keep you engaged and the runtime isn't pushed to 80+ hours.
The art style and music are distinctly Halo, enemies and the forerunner architecture have been redesigned to be closer to the original trilogy.
All in all a fantastic return to form, well worth the asking price."
MonkeGamer,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"I am going to be completely honest, this is the return of the halo franchise. It has an extremely varied and diverse weapon pool that is comprised of mostly useful and unique weapons. This helps so that the game isn't stale and you are not using the same weapon all the time. Vehicles are awesome, especially in multiplayer ad if you need a bit of dopamine just hop in a Wasp. The multiplayer is definitely kick-ass and will have you burning hours on the game. I will admit progression, content and custom games could be better. Custom games are buggy as hell and wont even load, progression is bare-bones and lacking juice and although the maps feel like halo and flow excellently, there are only like 9 so the content is a bit lacking but 343 is currently working on it and will patch the game up over time with updates. On the campaign side of things, it is definitely fun. The story is able to tie up Halo 5's loose ends while starting master chiefs new journey on zeta halo. Overall, an execellent game worth your money even though it's free."
Arcatom,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"This is the Halo I’ve been waiting for since Halo:CE. This game isn’t perfect, no game is, but what 343 nailed is bringing the fun back to Halo. It’s a joy to play and runs great."

Mattyice,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"This is my first return to Halo since Halo 4 (which I was not a fan of) given I was an owner of a PS4 for the previous console generation, and I know the series' reputation fell off a bit since then, but, in spite of going in with this mindset Halo Infinite is a really fun and entertaining romp. The campaign was very nice, but for me the multiplayer (especially with it being FTP and on Xbox GamePass) is awesome. Things feel very balanced, it's wildly fun and replayable, and the customization options are great as well. My only issues stem from the small amount of maps (which I'm sure will be expanded upon with free DLC in the future) and the slow progression system. Otherwise, this is a really nice return to the series for me and seemingly many fans of the series feel the same way."

dusk_zealot,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Truly feels like classic halo again. There’s innovation in the right places. Little to no change for the sake of change, it just plays like a perfect balance between modern and classic that I think both types of gamers can enjoy. It’s lacking in content atm but 343 is committed to address all of these issues as they have been all along. Ultimately, It’s a strong foundation to expand the halo universe on for sure."
lilkillpappy,"Dec 12, 2021",7,"pros:
-good combat
-beautiful environments
-good AI
-fantastic audio design and music
-fantastic character animations
-fantastic cinematics

cons:
-dialogue and story are designed for children, very boring.
-pointless open world lacks any compelling reason to engage in it
-repetitive gameplay loop. You can play through a small handful of encounters and experience everything the game has to offer. The entire game boils down to shoot, hide or run, reload, shoot some more. Repeat that a thousand times and you have this game."
Captiosus,"Dec 12, 2021",7,"Probably the best Halo campaign 343 has done but, IMO, still doesn’t quite reach the bar set by the Bungie original trilogy. Close, though. Story was decent but I probably would have been lost if I hadn’t just redone full playthroughs of Halo 1 through 5 of the month before release. Even then, I don’t feel like they did a great job setting up the Banished or why the Elites are willingly working for Brute leadership. And I really disliked Echo-216 despite his plot twists, which made a major portion of the campaign story feel less impactful overall. The plot twist for the Weapon was predictable from five miles away, especially if you collected the audio logs along the way. The biggest problem with the story is it doesn't really go anywhere. It exists to 'fix' the silly decisions they made with Cortana in Halo 4 and Halo 5 and, by the end, essentially serves as a soft reboot for the Master Chief.

Difficulty is all over the place. Rank-and-file enemies are easy, even on Legendary. But bosses have a difficulty spike on Heroic and Legendary that is almost in the realm of Dark Souls. Punishing unless you learn their patterns, and with a host of cheap abilities that can easily kill you if you make one mistake. The final three bosses are extremely punishing.

I'm really torn on how I feel about the open world of the game. It's very Ubisoft-y, which is to say it's loaded with collectibles and sidequests that are only tangentially linked to the main story. The Banished High Value Targets, for example. Like other similar open world games, it becomes rote about half way in. That said, I found it less boring than actual Ubisoft open worlds, likely due to the speed of map traversal and the quick access to vehicles. On the same topic, I was a bit disappointed in the armor unlocks found throughout the world. They are mostly color schemes and a handful of weapon charms. But like the story, the open world really goes nowhere. Liberating outposts and taking over Banished outposts have no meaningful effect on the world or the game. Once you leave, enemies just respawn. The game feels like it's trying to straddle two worlds: It starts with two linear missions before dumping you out into the open world, then spends the entire third act as a linear narrative that doesn't allow you to return to the open world at all. The open world is a very shallow sandbox that feels like an afterthought.

The campaign is riddles with bugs - from achievements that don't properly unlock, to dumb enemy AI in vehicles, frequent audio cutouts, and several instances of graphical stutter, sometimes with graphical freezes lasting a full 5+ seconds -- and this was on Series X and happened in both Performance and Quality modes.

This game should be called what it is: Retail Early Access. Taken as a whole, including both campaign and multiplayer (because Halo has never in its history been campaign only), this game is missing a lot of features that are/were considered staples of the Halo franchise. By 343's own statements, many of these things won't be around for months. By this time next year, we'll have something resembling a complete game with campaign coop, forge, more maps, more modes, dedicated playlists, bug and server stability fixes, mission/level replay, etc. -- all things that are lacking at launch. Releasing an incomplete product and patching in major things later is becoming far too common practice from 343. They did it with Halo: MCC, Halo 5, and now Halo Infinite.

Alas, the Halo bias is strong. If ANY OTHER game launched with this many missing features across campaign and MP, myriad bugs, missing graphical features on PC and next gen, and widespread complaints about multiplayer monetization, it wouldn't be getting 8's, 9's and 10's. In its current state I give it a solid 7 with the possibility to become a 9 over the next several months. But I can only review what we have in front of us now, and it's missing too many things, has too many bugs, to score it any higher."
Extroyr,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Phenomenal game. The campaign is absolutely amazing with arguably the best in the series. Along with a ever evolving multiplayer that will continue to add modes and weapons as time goes on. My only grudge against the game is that the progression system not very good, but 343 can and will fix it. They already are adding more modes to multiplayer."
Selaxio,"Dec 12, 2021",10,un juegazo aunque no sea mundo abierto total o aun es muy entretenido poder explorar lo que se pueda del anillo y lo mas probable es que actualicen el juego para agregarle mas cosas como historia o hacerlo mas abierto este juego se que será una obra de arte con el tiempo

Anthor,"Dec 12, 2021",4,"Una de las peores campañas que ha dado esta generación y la anterior, repitiendo contenido a la hora escasa de partida, bestiario escaso, mundo vacío e inerte, élites insulsos y sin jefes memorables, pues los que dice tener no son más que enemigos random con una barra de boss encima de gratis. No hacen más que tanquear y con suerte tienen dos patrones de ataque. Peor que mediocre.

Malo también en diseño de niveles. En exteriores, una roca muerta donde no hay nada más que campamentos clonados y algún fuerte. Interiores de juguete y todos iguales, construcciones de brocha gorda a base de cubos amontonados con cansinas oleadas de los mismos bichos todo el rato, lineales como una tabla y aburridos hasta decir basta, donde no haces más que activar switches y artefactos.

De suspenso y nefasto para su supuesto presupuesto millonario."

Ledbetter32,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"I had such unrealistically high expectations for this game that I thought for sure that they couldn’t be met. Well, they were met and then some. Since the campaign came out all I’ve wanted to do is come home and play. The gameplay loop is addictive. The open world is immersive. The campaign story is emotional and has had me invested the entire time. The mystery and wonder is back in this game just like the earlier titles in the franchise. The freedom to explore the ring at your leisure is incredible and I know I’ll be trying to find Easter Eggs and Skulls for months to come.        We’ve all heard about the progression issues and lack of game modes in the multiplayer. I know it’s “unacceptable” that those things weren’t better at launch. But the important thing to me is that I haven’t had this much fun playing a Halo multiplayer since Halo 3. I’ve played with more friends than ever and the amount of funny/intense moments we’ve had is countless already. The core gameplay and mechanics are there. The fun is there. The fixes will come and this game will be that much better because of it.        343 needed to get this game right after Halo 5. And they did. Couldn’t be more happy with it and for all their hard work. They listened to the Halo community over the last 6 years and they’re listening more than ever now. This game is amazing!"

Lucio777,"Dec 12, 2021",10,best gameplay in the saga the open world and very well done has enough variety of scenery or structures ... there are many goals to do but it never gets cloying because every combat and conflict is unique in the game the game always inspires you to explore whether by car or with the hook you can move anywhere .... the story itself is like every halo but very well done and written ... I'll stop here but this game has a lot of positive points I can't even remember the negatives

HarveyCR,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Best shooter of 2021!

Campaign is nice. Soundtrack is amazing. Very good game as expected, i would advise **** absolute delight. Love the replayablity and quality of the gameplay. Probably my favorite Halo after Halo 3"
Tigerclawzzz,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Halo is back baby!

343 has brought halo back to its roots. Simply put, halo infinite is fun as hell! Its addictive and incredibly enjoyable to pick up and play. The story has blown me away as well and it is up there with one of the best halo experiences and one of my personal favourite games I’ve played in quite some time

I highly recommend playing this perfect halo game"
CrimsonMayhem,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Man, este juego está buenísimo, los diálogos de los enemigos, la música, los paisajes, realmente te sientes parte del juego, recomendadísimo."
Bene86,"Dec 12, 2021",0,"Boring Campaign, no co-op, boring sandboxgame. Bring back the real halo! A real halo is NOT thst boring openworld stuff."
zombiefreak666,"Dec 12, 2021",0,Should have been a masterpiece but instead we got a broken and unfinished game. To think about all the developer time and the crazy amount of money put into halo infinite it is an embarrassment. As far as the gameplay goes it's spot on lots of fun and the potential of being a great game but with the small amount of content available and a rubbish progression system makes for a massive disappointment. The only part of the game that seems polished is the store as you can tell the monetization was the main concern.
Orka_Stavr,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"Не большой фанат игр типа Far cry  но данная вариация во вселенной   Halo  мне зашла.  Захватывать базы, и сражаться с босами интересно. Мультиплеер просто космос. Есть претензии к сюжету т.к нравиться лор во вселенной HALO."
Tyapchik,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"Годная игра, интересная, увлекательная, работает отлично, на моём мощном ПК проблем нет. Плохо лишь то, что нет русской озвучки."
TurboChards,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"I’ll keep this simple as graphics were good, gameplay was great, and the story was really good.

I spent more time finding things in the open world than many would of done, and it was a nice touch.  Running into actual fights versus loading a level only made for a rather good experience.

Graphics wise for the campaign running at 60fps on the XSX with a VRR OLED was amazingly good.  Detail in Master Chief’s armor was detailed dramatically compared to the original showing of the game.  Some cutscene issues with what appears to be uneven frame rate being shown had a slight impact, but I know that will be fixed.

This game did an excellent job at patching the horrible story from Halo 5 in terms of its beloved main characters but I will say I wish it turned out differently.  That being said I can’t give this game a 10 if I wanted to because the story was good but it wasn’t a full revision of the Halo 5 catastrophe.

It appears 343 has finally did it; they made a campaign and a multiplayer both really good for the same title.  Congrats and I hope they fix the issues on the multiplayer we all want to be done."

IV666,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"After Halo 4 and 5 this is great way to earn Halo fans respect. Campaign is awesome, it still has some issues, but we know 343 will patch them in future. Never been fan of multiplayer, but with this one i really liked it too. Thanks 343 for this great game."
StekloeD,"Dec 12, 2021",8,"Как бы я не хотел - психологически не могу позволить себе поставить оценку 10 так как присутствуют что проблемы с оптимизацией на ПК, что с открытым миром который всё же не так хорош каким бы он мог быть, НО...всё равно поставил высокий балл так как игра даёт то что нужно фанатам Halo, то за что и любят данную игру, а именно core-геймплей, те самые песочные бои и игромех который и ожидаешь получить от Halo и сделаны они отлично. На этот раз ещё и вооружение хорошее в отличии от 4 и 5 части с оружием Предтеч которая по большей части было футуристичным аналогом людского и местами было откровенно скучным - здесь же вооружение мятежных брутов куда более интересное. И всё вместе даёт тот самый флоу который так нравится людям раскусившим формулу Halo и никакой пустоватый и несколько примитивный открытый мир его не испортит, а местами даже позволит реализовать то что давно хотелось в плане песочницы) Годнота) За сюжет пока что ничего не скажу так как не прошел до конца, но в целом он не раздражает своей подачей что уже хорошо, а разбросанные по миру голосовые дневники проливают свет на события между Halo 5 и Infinite"
SnooberReturns,"Dec 12, 2021",10,"This is only one of two games I have ever taken the time to rate on this website, and the other was simply to warn people against buying it. However, this game is an absolute masterpiece. I have beaten every Halo game with only the exception of the Wars games, and I can tell you that while I enjoyed 4, 5 left alot to be desired as far as Story goes. However, everything in Halo Infinite, from the sheer gameplay of multiplayer to the story, is absolutely stunning. Interestingly, the only downsides to Halo Infinite are ones that are already being fixed, such as playlists and future updates to the story to include more biomes. With that said, Halo Infinite is one of the best games I have ever played, and I have not enjoyed a game this much online since Halo 3. This very well could end up surpassing it as my favorite multiplayer game of all time."
Skofield9,"Dec 12, 2021",9,"Я получил то что ожидал. Прекрасный геймплей, великолепная музыка, самый умный ии в современных шутерах. Химия между тремя основными персонажами получилась очень хорошей. Мастер Чиф и ""кортана"" дают знать что хало жив.жив после несуразной пятой части. Графика отличная но без откровений. Мультиплеер очень фановый и затягивает надолго, особенно на фоне конкурентов. В итоге это отличная игра с мелкими недостатками о которых и говорить то не хочется. Спасибо 343 за увлекательное и порой сложное времяпровождение."

DiegoOrt,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Una verdadera obra maestra de los FPS, la campaña es simplemente una carga de emociones para quienes siguen la historia del juego, para los nuevos puede que no sea muy clara, las mecánicas, armas y combates son muy buenos, aunque a veces los entornos pueden tornarse repetitivos."
GuiLoreiro,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Halo é uma enorme franquia, não só presa nos jogos mas como também em livros, HQs, enfim, trazer uma história complexa em um jogo é complicado, prova disso é o próprio primeiro Halo que deu aquele ar de mistérios. Mesmo caso com o Halo 4 e um dos motivos de crítica, escolheram um assunto que é MUITO complexo e deu no que deu, deram continuidade no 5 mas com uma enorme bagunça não só na parte no roteiro, mas em tudo. E veio a esperança: Halo Infinite, onde se prova que, não é só a redenção da 343i, a desenvolvedora escutou seus fãs e trouxe a verdadeira experiência Halo que seu antecessor, Halo 5 Guardians, passou longe de ter entregado. Com a mistura de clássico e novo, a nova aventura do Master Chief envolve o novo misterioso Halo, que se denomina Halo Delta, ao mesmo tempo que surge dúvidas e mais dúvidas, deixando muitas coisas interpretativas ao público (Coisa que Halo 5 Guardians não fez). Adições tipo gancho melhorou muito a gameplay e facilita mais a diversão, e agora com mundo aberto, tem várias possibilidades de como invadir área X. Halo Infinite é (Na minha opinião) o melhor Halo desde Reach, com uma história incrível e com ainda perguntas não respondidas, a ansiedade para o próximo capítulo é enorme, envolvendo muitos mistérios e teorias."
RealityPill,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"Halo Infinite is an incredible return to form for the franchise. It is innovative yet familiar. This is the best Halo game 343i has delivered. This game is amazing! Get it, Play it, Enjoy it!

THE REALITY PILL (REVIEW no spoilers)
GAMEPLAY: 10
Gunplay feels great and mechanics are tight. The grapple hook and Spartan cores add to the game.

GRAPHICS: 8
Graphics are very good but not earth **** as this is a cross gen game. The game engine scales extremely well between Xbox One, One X and Series Consoles (I have all 3). The art direction in Infinite is closer to the Bungie games. The extra year of polish did the game justice.

CAMPAIGN: 9 The story is great for returning players. If you are new to Halo I recommend watching a story recap on YouTube. The characters and writing is good. The Pilot’s drive to survive conflicts with Master Chiefs sense of duty. The new AI is naive and Chief takes more of a leading role between the two. The open world allows for variety on how to attack scenarios. The world is not too big and I s full of conflict to keep you engaged and on your toes. It is just the right size where it doesn’t feel overwhelming or cluttered with too many side quests. I only wish that the environment had more variety. The lack of co-op knocked the score down a point but I do believe your first play through should be solo.

MOTION: 9 On Series X campaign is buttery smooth at 60fps and a huge difference compared to base Xbox One.

SOUND: 10
With familiar scores and new music this game sounds incredible. They really put a lot of effort here.

MULTIPLAYER: 8
The Fun factor is a 10. There are some issues that 343i has acknowledged are fixing like progression system and modes but gameplay is solid. This is the most fun I have ever had in a multiplayer shooter ever.

FUN FACTOR: 10
Heroic is challenging and will test your skills without feeling unfair.

REPLAYABILITY: 10
Lots to do and explore and Multiplayer is amazing keeping you coming back for more.

OVERALL SCORE: 9 MY RANT: Anyone giving this game a low score is just review bombing. METACRITIC should do a better job of preventing extremely low scores (0-3) that are pure fanboy nonsense. Maybe have it where a minimum player score is a 5 so it has less negative impact on the scoring system and we get a better sense of how any game truly scores. Just my thoughts.

Thanks for reading and making it this far! GAME ON!"
fedez,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Really awesome game, it is simple but done in a good way, staring to get back the halo franchise, I want to see more."

UnderratedFlame,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"It's the Halo we've been waiting for 10 years. Yes Halo 4 campaign was good but the multiplayer wasn't quite there. And Halo 5 was the other way arround, but didn't feel a sandbox-based game like the og trilogy, something was missing. Luckily Halo Infinite does what we wanted, make a game with the things that made the og trilogy so special and innovate in a new and refreshing way. Great campaign, great multiplayer, superb sountrack. Yes, the progression needs to improve, and we've been told that they would do so. To sum up, Halo is back and the future is looking BRIGHT and PROMISING."
Chrisald,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"The best Halo since Reach

Stan_a,"Dec 11, 2021",10,Amazing!! Playing this in my Series X and loving every minute of it.  Super smooth frame rate and haven’t encountered any bugs so far.  Well worth the wait.
RECKLE5S,"Dec 11, 2021",9,The best installment since Halo 3. Had a ton of fun in the campaign. The gameplay feels fantastic and is reminiscent of the OG Halo formula with some tweaks which make it even better.
jdiggs,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Incredible return to form.  Feels like the first 3 games brought into a new world.  The openworld aspect works really well for the franchise even though it's not nearly as robust as the proper openworld games.   Not all the features are there on Day 1, like coop and forge, but 343 really nailed the story/gameplay/feeling of Halo.  And those missing features are coming next year."
craigthebruce,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"This game does battling alien armies in outer space across expansive battlefields better than any previous Halo. In the game the villain says ""armies cannot stop him"" and you really get that feeling of awesome power when swinging through enemies with the grapplehook."
JimPickens,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"So I just finished Halo Infinite's campaign, and I kinda loved it.

There's a common sentiment going around right now regarding infinite, that it's ""Not a perfect game, but a damn good one"" and I have to agree. Infinite is absolutely flawed and misses the mark on a few instances, but overall I left this game feeling pretty damn optimistic for Halo's future, which I haven't felt in... a while.

The story of Infinite feels less like another chapter in the series and more like a new beginning for the series, which I think is for the best. 343i haven't been the best when handling legacy characters so I think it's best they bring in there own characters, and luckily they've gotten much better than Vale, remember Vale? Of course you don't. The new characters introduced here being, Echo-216, the pilot shown off in all the trailers, and The Weapon, an AI designed after Cortana. Both characters are fun and endlessly enjoyable to watch, their writing has come under scrutiny for being ""one note"", which is accurate, but I don't find it to be much of an issue here, I think their fun and given the games short length they don't really have time to get annoying, at least to me. Infinite's antagonist ""Escharum"" has also gotten quite a bit of flack for being very ""Saturday morning cartoon"" feeling, and again, yes I agree, but I think the game overall has that kind of feeling. A lot of what happens feels pretty superfluous, aside from the very end nothing of note happens, it's all about Chief, Weapon and the Pilot restoring Zeta Halo and clearing out the Banished, the UNSC aren't really involved aside from a few Marine NPC's and some recordings about some Spartans and Laskey. I don't think any of this is bad by the way, it's all very entertaining and fun, just not very impactful to the overall story. Speaking of superfluous.

The open world ****. Ok no it doesn't it's fine, but it's JUST fine. An open world Halo never really excited me in the first place, I like my Halo scripted, many great moments from the series ARE scripted: the Warthog run, the Scarab fights, Objective: Survive, but Infinite lacks these in favour of having you the player create your own set pieces, which is fine, just not what I come to Halo for. The open world is very Far Cry feeling, and no that's not a good thing. I have finished all the side objectives, every FOB, HVT and Outpost, none of them change, none of them are unique and none  of them are very exciting save for the first of each because it's new... kinda. It's all very repetitive and not worth your time, you don't really get anything out of it, except for FOB's which unlock fast travel points and weapon drop off's, of which jarringly, do not include flying vehicles, if you want a Banshee you gotta go search for one yourself and they're not too common. Then there's the age old complaint about tediously moving from one objective to the other, it's boring, made slightly better by the grappling hook, due to more vertical movement and slightly faster traversal, but I'd still rather a linear mission-to-mission structure, and I hope 343 go back to that in the next game.

Now for some small stuff: I think 343 have hit a perfect balance for Chief. Chief talks A LOT in Infinite, but it's all very to the point, typically short, few word sentences, only ever in response, not full paragraphs like in Halo 4 where he just didn't shut up. I like Chief a lot in Infinite, he feels like he's starting to open up more in his old age and I'm happy with that change. Hunters kinda ****, I found it nigh-on impossible to get behind them, I just settled for attacking their knees, never had that issue before, just here. Ammo felt frustratingly low, ran out of ammo in both guns way more than any other Halo game, which can really screw you up in a tense fight with a Sword Elite.

As for MP, I love it, it feels amazing. A MP hasn't gotten me so excited since... Halo 3, I think in terms of MP 343 have hit the nail dead on the head, it's perfect. I don't really care about customization, but it seems pretty bad and apparently the Challenges have caused a lot issue with people not trying to win games but just getting challenges done, so ya know... fix that. But the actual gameplay and the structure of online games, chefs kiss.

I'm just really happy to have Halo back the way I remember. I think 343 have proven with Infinite, that they can change, they can improve, and most importantly, they can listen. For the first time in forever, I'm happy about where Halo is and I'm excited and positive about its future. I don't know when Halo will end, but when it does, I'm sure 343 will send it out with a bang."

ComicCraze,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Halo Infinite is the best Halo game we've had in a while. When I first began the campaign, I didn't have too much of an interest in the story. After a few early missions, I started to wandering around the open world collecting multiplayer unlockables, data pads, and upgrades for Master Chief. While wandering around was fun, the game didn't really get to me hooked until I had continued the campaign missions. The narrative took a slow but steady drawing of interest that eventually made me forget about the open world content. I went from playing a mission after I explored to going from mission to mission, unable to wait for the next story beat. The combination of great gameplay, and intriguing story had me enjoy every second of this game I have played. Even after I finished the campaign missions, I played for hours and hours on end. I couldn't have asked for a better Halo game. I just want to say thank you, 343, for giving us a campaign that has me excited for whatever you have planned next."

richyet93,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"Almost perfect. Best gunplay in any FPS out at the moment. Graphics are great, not perfect - lots of pop in when using wasp, but overall very good. Story is convoluted, you have to have played other games to completely understand the character arcs, but I don’t see why 343 should have to pander to newbies. Let down was no weather cycle, lack of scarabs and big set pieces, and some boss designs were infuriating. Multiplayer is an absolute triumph 10/10 (minus the PC cheats)."
huevosdechango,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"As a halo and rpg lover I am very happy with the final product we got, obviously with expansions it'll get better, the only bad thing is the repetitive scenarios all over the game, but the gameplay and story outshines it"
Midknightlance,"Dec 11, 2021",9,Ive been playing halo since Halo CE and I’ve stuck with the series through it all and was starting to lose faith through halo 5 but I’m so happy I stuck with the series halo 6 gives me the same nostalgic feelings and excitement as the originally trilogy just finished the campaign and needed to do this never rated a game before so take with a grain of salt. halo infinite is back to basics halo and even though at first I was skeptic all of the open world nature and needing to go from one point to the next before getting the next taste of story progression to satisfy my curiosity as to what happened where’s this character what happened to this character. There’s definitely areas that get dull and repetitive but overall I’m just happy that halos back and being done well again :)
marcus9000,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Excellent campaign, they managed to give freshness to the saga without doing damage, technically very good, graphically in line with other recent productions but not free from defects, AI in many moments is among the best ever seen, other times it makes gross or comic errors ; when they add the coop and the forge, we will be faced with the best Halo made by the 343i, almost on par with a sacred beast like halo 3."

Espero 343 industries sepa continuar la buena narrativa que dejo la primera campaña de halo infinite. 100% recomendable, y no sólo por la historia, sino porque verdaderamente es divertido y dinámico. Talvez no fue lo mejor el decir que era un mundo abierto, pero si es necesario recalcar lo grande y explotable que se vuelve el mapa cuando terminas con las primeras misiones de cada zona descubierta.

I'm only about 7 hours into the campaign and so far it far been a very enjoyable experience. Opening sequence is breathtaking and really sets the tone for the rest of the game. Open world experience alongside the grappleshot gives limitless opportunities to explore and feels like an extension of Halo 1 in the best ways possible.

Multiplayer feels like a direct sequel to Halo 3 along side new equipment types that feel balanced. Ranked play can feel sweaty at times but I enjoy these games as my adrenaline spikes when in Battle Riffle duels. Quick play and Big team battle are also fun modes when not wanting to try so hard.

Additional Wants
- Different MP modes
- Campaign Co-op
- New MP maps
- Forge

I give it a 9 as the game sits right now. Once additional content comes out, I can see this game getting a solid 10/10 from me. Excited for the future of Halo!"
Realreview215,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Love the game. MP is solid and refreshing, the campaign is a good time. Halo is back baby!"
Travis374,"Dec 11, 2021",9,Thats whatsup love takin over fobs and looking for skulls the best combat in multiplayer loads of fun
Imnice87,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"One of the best looking halo games ever and with free to play mp, it makes for epic fun!"
Dmb92,"Dec 11, 2021",10,Halo is back!………………….. runs great…………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
CheloOz,"Dec 11, 2021",10,De los mejores Halo sin duda alguna. Esa sensación de nostalgia es bien premiada para los fans.
FrankPineda22,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"realmente no esperaba mucho de este titulo, no he jugado la saga desde halo reach, pero la campaña se me ha hecho muy fiel a la calidad que nos tenían acostumbrados en años anteriores, con giros argumentales excelentes, profundidad de personajes excelente y un mundo abierto muy bueno teniendo en cuenta que no se considera OpenWorld. El multijugador se me hace muy bien, manteniendo mecánicas y jugabilidad de la campaña lo cual lo hace fácil de jugar pero difícil de maniobrar, aun mas merito teniendo en cuenta que es gratuito y que el juego completo este incluido en game pass es un plus. Simplemente excelente"
rahiriz,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"I finally finished the campaign. I loved it and the open world is beautiful. Played it on a 4k HDR tv and it amazed me how good it looks. Gameplay is flawless, love the hook!!!! I actually don't even use the vehicles, just the hook to travel around. The story is very emotional and not expected. I recommend playing the other halo games to understand everything otherwise u may not understand some things they talk about. 10 10 for me!"
LinkyChan,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"100% completion of the campaign in 3 days, loved it when I usually hate open world games, best halo since 3 and reach."
TheAManOW,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"This game has so much potential, its incredible to see. The gameplay is so solid, the campaign has me intrigued for the future of Halo, and most importantly, the issues the game has on the Multiplayer side have been addressed very quickly by 343i, and that really helps elevate this from a 9 to a 10 for me.  I am excited for the future of Halo!

Oh, and the music is lovely."
peanutsPRO,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"This is a really hard game to rate.  I say that because I really love Halo.  If you are only going to play this for the campaign then it is a 9.2/10.  The gameplay mechanics is a 10/10.  Enemy AI 10/10 along with friendly AI, the marines are actually really helpful in this game  you can tell that 343 spent alot of time working on this AI.  The difficulty isnt all that balanced between various difficulties I would have to give it a 8/10.  Do not play this game in Normal,  just play in heroic, because the difference between the two isnt very much at all.  The open world is really beautiful, but it gets a little repetative.  The FOBs are alot of fun the first few times but, they get really repetative.  They are basically all the same, that is really my only complaint.  There are these other missions where you hunt down high value targets from the banished and they are AWESOME.  Also i had loads of fun just finding skulls and spartan lockers all over the map.  It is a beautiful world. The world as a whole is really cool.  9/10.  The story itself is really good, but it feels like it is unfinished.  To be completely honest it seems like it was the first game in the series instead of being the end of the reclaimer saga.  Again this is the only thing i can complain about in terms of the story.  This game dives into who master chief is.  It really gives the players an idea of who he is in a way that no other halo has ever done.  The stakes are high in this story. That being said I feel like it has earned a 9/10 for the story.  There is alot to love about the story as a whole but when the game ends you are just left feeling like it ended too early.  The multiplayer is where i feel like it falls a little too short.  The multiplayer is ALOT of fun but without the ability to choose the game mode you play I feel like the highest score i can give that is a 8/10.  I do realize they will fix the multiplayer in the coming days that is the only reason i gave it an 8.  In its current state it is a 6 or a 7 only because of it lacking the ability to choose game modes.  As much as i love halo I cant give this game a perfect score because there are some flaws but, overall this game is really good.  It is very refreshing though because it is obvious 343 is finally figuring out how to make a halo game.  My review for halo 4 (6) and halo 5 (4)can reflect how i have hated where this series was headed but now it is getting back on track.
This game's campaign is a 9.2/10 but as a whole is an 8/10 because of the multiplayer but since the PLAYSTATION fanboys are bombing this game i will give it a 9 to balance the score."
EseMercantil,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Halo Infinite is a love letter from 343 to all Halo Fans. The story is so simple yet it manages to be so deep thanks to the lovable characters, mystery and the questions to resolve. The open world formula is nice and refreshing take on Halo, while the linear and classic Halo fashioned levels still remain. This is the first time (in my opinion) a Halo game has ended with a good ending that gives so much potential for the next entry in the franchise. It fixes all the past mistakes 343 has done with their last games and gives us a new Halo universe in a much better place and a story we're all interested in learning more about."
rizayevshokh,"Dec 11, 2021",10,its amazing game/ i m play this play all the time. and i think this game is the best shooter.
Jarino,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Best Halo since Halo 3 / Reach! Finally! Amazing sound and graphics! Playing on my 77” G1 4K 120 FPS with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos! Amazing experience, can’t wait until the DLC drops and Co-op. Excited for what they are going to do with Halo next year(s)!"
Matveikent,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Перед выходом игры посмотрел обзоры блогеров, и был очень сильно разочарован.
Но проиграв часов 6
Я понял что зря я так сильно расстроился
Игра получилась отличная с отличной графикой и сюжетом который захватывает"
tvgamer14jcb,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"No spoilers. Honestly, not what I was expecting but it exceeded my expectations in terms of story and gameplay. The open world is way more fun than I expected - and if you just want classic halo experience, the missions are great too. Honestly the boss fights are so fun aswell."
akasaldana,"Dec 11, 2021",8,"Game is great. Couple plot points I was expecting to see tied up in this game that simply weren't there. Maybe 25 to 30 percent of the main plot is explained in audio logs, which is awesome bc it incentivises exploration (they are great logs and totally worth finding), I was just a little bummed that there wasn't just a bit more cinematics. Story is a grand improvement over 5. Much more focused. As a long time Halo fan, as well as fan of 343s trilogy, this game checks the boxes for me. Even with stuff I didn't get to see. This campaign, the game is set up in a way that tells us we'll probably get answers to this stuff in whatever the next few entries of Halo are. I am looking forward to seeing how this new story unfolds."
Dan_Sonrics,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"El juego es un renacer para la franquicia de Halo después del desastre de la campaña (historia) de Halo 5.
El sandbox es muy bonito y esta muy bien diseñado, realmente siento esa libertad que siempre había querido tener en Halo, recuerdo que de pequeño cada nivel de Halo intentaba explorarlo a más no poder y ver cada rincón con las posibilidades que me brindaban en esa época y ahora con el sandbox tan amplio que tiene y con las nuevas mecánicas (principalmente el gancho) es un sueño hecho realidad. Ahora si podrás escalar hasta la cima esas montañas que ves a lo lejos y no solamente lo quedarás viendo a lo lejos.

Ahora sobre los combates contra los enemigos (lo jugué en legendario) es muy muy demandante, contra los jefes principales requiere toda tu astucia y pericia para derrotarlos, son un dolor de cabeza (visto de la mejor manera porque quería un reto por eso lo puse en legendario), contra los npc's normales son agresivos, prácticamente leen tus movimientos incluso antes de que los hagas y más si están en grupo, si te descuidas hasta un grunt te puede matar fácilmente y ni se diga nada de los jackals francotiradores que como todo sabemos son la cereza sobre el pastel en la dificultad (aunque no son tan difíciles como en halo 2).
El juego te enseña y te obliga a que aprendas sus mecánicas para que puedas progresar. Los primeros niveles me costaba mucho derrotar a los enemigos, pero ya casi finalizando el juego sentía que era una danza que tenia con los enemigos en donde daba un paso mal y moría, pero si no fallaba fluía el juego.

Respecto a la historia, uff, profunda, intima, llegadora, contiene la faceta más humana del jefe maestro, y la conexión que realiza con los nuevos personajes es asombrosa. Los nuevos personajes son carismáticos, The Weapon es encantadora, inocente, curiosa y con ganas de aprender, pese a que es una IA esa una humana, El piloto, es humano tal cual, una persona que tiene miedo de morir, que no sabe nada sobre lo que acontece en los temas más importantes de los conflictos vividos, es como si fuéramos nosotros mismos, no tenemos idea de lo que esta pasando al otro lado del mundo realmente, solamente tenemos poquitas referencias y nos hacemos una vaga idea, pero nada más, y si nos llegamos a enfrascar en un conflicto donde no somos el personaje principal actuaríamos con miedo, con desesperación, frustración así es el piloto, pero llega un momento en el cual el piloto se redime y evoluciona; prácticamente los 3 personajes principales tienen una enorme sinergia que se apoyan a desarrollarse y evolucionar. Y quiero mencionar algo importante, ahora sí el contexto de leyenda que le dan al jefe maestro como la súper maquina de matar esta tan bien construido que por fin siento toda esa mítica de él y su estatus de Demon al ojo de los enemigos.

Y para finalizar, el multiplayer es súper entretenido y  bien balanceado. Son horas y horas de juego adictivo para no acabar. Las listas de juego son limitadas por el momento, pero el 14 de Diciembre de 2021 aplicaran nuevas listas de juego que expandirán la diversión aun más.

Conclusión: Halo Infinite es un excelente juego, no queda nada a deber y es una juego planeado para una duración mínima de 10 años, donde sacaran más DLC de expansión a la campaña (que prácticamente serán más campañas del mismo calibre a esta primer campaña) y al multijugador le estarán metiendo contenido constantemente. A Halo Infinite solamente le queda mejorar más de lo que es actualmente."

Fallen1985,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Xbox truly singlehandedly saved gaming in 2021, i'm not even joking. Imagine this November-December without Forza Horizon 5 and Halo Infinite. All other shooters failed miserably. Forza Horizon 5 has amazing graphics and it's one of the best arcade-racing games of all time. Xbox Forever!"
Antwanharrysun,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Campaign is amazing.

Best Gameplay in the series, the semi-open world is a lot of fun. Rescuing marines and fighting back the banish while upgrading the Master Chiefs armor abilities is really enjoyable. It’s the best Master Chief has ever felt to play with, actually feel like a very powerful super soldier. The bosses are really cool, some are very very hard. The entire plot and story fits well with the gameplay and the things you are doing. The setting is beautiful, day/night cycle is really cool. The actual linear missions are breathtaking with really cool designs and mystery to them. Any Halo fan will really enjoy what they are seeing and exploring. The story can be divisive but I like it a lot, wraps up Cortana and Halo 5 while setting up a new story arc and future for Master Chief. Excited for the future Campaigns that will be coming. Multiplayer is best the series has ever had. 10/10 gameplay wise. Needs better customization and progression though. But as Free to Play game it’s understandable why they are doing it like this but I hope the backlash is heard and changes are made

Overall A 9.5/10 belongs right there with the original Halos. Campaign though is my new favorite tied with Halo 2 but with future Campaigns coming I would say it could be my favorite game ever to play through. I enjoyed it that much."
Rolis13,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Este juego es genial, la verdad este juego tiene mucho contenido genial, y el gancho esta increible gracias 343i :D"
FylinB563,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"This is one of the best campaigns I've played in halo for quite a long time.  I'm not sure if I'd call it the best but it is by far better then halo 4 and 5.  The only reason I'm not giving a 10 is because of the armor customization in multiplayer.  Since the multiplayer is free 343 still has to make money off of it so microtransactions are understandable, BUT it is almost impossible to unlock any new armor equipment without spending money which I think Is ridiculous."
Lifeiseasyy,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"All i have to say is this is one of the best video games of all time, great time to be alive!!!!!!!!"
ZJ02,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"A massive W for Xbox/Halo fans. I grew up with this series, but after Halo 5 I felt that it was time to let it go. The last 2 games in the series felt bland and had a weak story, but halo infinite rejuvenated it. The story was amazing, awesome visuals, and a great combination of familiar features and all new ones. 10/10"
Shoffma69,"Dec 11, 2021",7,"The best installment 343i has come out with yet, however it's clear the game is quite unpolished. This game has a good core with massive potential but clearly need another year or more of development. It's like someone made your favorite meal but didn't quite make all of the right choices or follow the neccesary steps along the way. Probably the best half baked game I've ever played"
FreetoPlayGames,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"This game is going to be Legendary, because it's one of the first steps showing how powerful and great Xbox is. I bet 360 era will come again in 2022-2027, because not only Halo, Xbox also has Elder Scrolls and much more! PS5 truly dropped the ball this December. You are not giving anything to your fans to play in Christmas time? Damn, that's just sad."

UnagiGanu,"Dec 11, 2021",1,"Not the halo experience I was expecting. The multilayer was pretty decent but got boring fast.
The campaign had really bland level design and the outdoor open world area looked good but outdated and although the mechanics kinda save it from being terrible, it just feels like a poorly executed version of destiny."
PS5LostLoL,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"Xbox once again proves that they are best of the best and no other console can get even close. Sure Sony has had hit games in past, but most of them are extremely linear ""movie-games"". Spider-Man was fun i guess, but overall Sony games are meh. No offence. Halo Infinite shows how you should write characters and story, make world fun and interesting and especially, make gameplay fun."
point_decay,"Dec 11, 2021",8,"In many ways it seems like 3/4 of a finnished game, lacking features and cross gen graphically, but it plays so well.

The minute to minute combat is up there with COD and Destiny.

I had reasonably low expectations due to its development history, but 343 have done such a great job making it feel like an old school Halo game whilst moving it into an open world setting that makes it difficult to put down. It just feels great to play.

Its not perfect, and im sure the game were playing today will look completely different in the months to come in terms of features, but what we have today is probably the most fun FPS ive played this year."

Epic_Username_,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"If this game was made by Naughty Dog, story would be horrible, Weapon would kill Master Chief in first hour or so and this big bad guy would win.

Kariq,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"I mean just speechless, where do I even start. Well the open world or semi open world is amazing. It might seem dull to some people if you don't go around and explore and not grapple or sprint everywhere but I genuinely spent like mayb 5-6 hours exploring alone. Going to certain places for cool visual pleasing moment's. This open world levels are FUN as hell like seriously and massive Jesus Christ this game is BUILT for co-op which is my favorite feature about halo games since ce. Now the main missions are great. One of the first missions dear God the environment for me was breath taking bc I LOVE that kind of dark mysterious thunder type environments. Also the fact i could jump to any one of the platforms has made it my most immersed, and beautiful moment in history. It's even better than coming out the tunnel in ce when under cover of night starts playing its just so amazing.Well I can say some of the levels started to get repetitive and at moment's I  found myself less exploring each room because it was the same thing, the combat and ce vibes mad me appreciate the repetitive levels from ce and memories so. Now gameplay, yeah just like all the youtubers who got early access said, this game has the best sandbox ever in a halo game. It is so much fun is practically hard to explain if you haven't played like Jesus. U played on legendary and  I had to use all equipment but God it was so fun. Legendary is like halo 2 hard buts it's a little close especially in some areas. Some of these areas you seriously need co-op. Boss fights man soooooooo much fun. There is one boss fight that's just dumb easy. But man each boss was like built up to. It was one boss fights I feel like was just there to be there for filler but it was fun. One of the boss fights had this one music and mannnnn it is my favorite song in infinite like it was like a Arcadian type of halo mix and man it was so addicting, bc it fit the difficulty. Now all and all if this game had different biomes it would be my favorite halo ever. But sadly it doesn't and the world doesn't feel as refresh as say odst or halo ce. Amazing game tho and planning on spending alot of time into campaign alone. I was never a multiplayer guy I was always the campaign and always replayed the campaigns mire so coming from in my opinion a terrible infinite multiplayer, me as a campaign fan glad they did an outstanding job in the campaign. 343 has gave me joy in my trash life rn so I cannot thank them enough."
Oxolotto,"Dec 11, 2021",7,The gameplay is incredible but it is missing some features example: you can't chose what game mode you want to play. The battle pass progression is slow and hopefully they fix it soon. But the shop prices are crazy I know the multiplayer is free and I wouldn't mind the microtransactions but 20 euro for a skin is overpriced. There is no reason not to try it.
METALHEAD200743,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"i can't say that halo infinite is the best halo ever made, because it's not. but it's in my top 3 favorite games of the series. I give it a 9/10"

GrabacrSquadron,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"This is the sequel to Halo 3 we've been waiting for. Soundtrack, art direction and gameplay are ABSOLUTELY stellar, best in class. This is probably the best gameplay ever for a FPS alongside DOOM Eternal. 343 Industries did it. Against all odds. GOTY 2021."

ChompyTurtle,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"Halo Infinite brushes Halo 5 under the rug while still keeping the main point that Cortana turned on the Master Chief and humanity. The open world aspect of the game while good and a breath of fresh air for the franchise, feels slightly outdated the best comparison I can make is the far cry series. You go from one stronghold to another and take out swarms of enemies. That being said the the fast moving gameplay is enjoyable and the story makes you excited for the next instalment of the franchise."

TanelTanel,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"Story, gameplay, art-style, AI. All amazing
The difficulty is again like in CE and that is amazing and making it soo that in the harder difficulties the enemies aren't bullet sponges like in 4 and 5, but rather making them more intelligent, faster thinking, but never unfair to fight against. (Ignore the rocket flood in CE, it didn't happen)
Althou it is lacking in biome section, only plains with a few rivers, waterfalls and swamp-ish areas. No tundras, no true swamps, deserts nor snowy areas.
The music is again like in CE but newer, if someone told me that the new tracks were unused Marty’s tracks from CE I would believe it.
In conclusion: its not perfect, but with everything they did to fix the story and gameplay after Halo 5…its reboot we all wanted."

Crussh,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"Excellent game. I have now 10 hours in the campaign and I am really happy about it. Controls feels smooth, shooting is awesome. Legendary offers a great deal of challenge but is not impossible. Enemies are strong but each of them have well crafted visual and sound design that gives you insight on their movement and abilities to monitor the battleground. The objectives are diverse and well done. AI are aggressive and sometime can surprise you. The soundtrack is subtle, yet it supports the action pretty well.

The only negatives are the immersion. I would have loved a better immersion on the remaining UNSC troops. It feels like they are just there and awaiting you to get ''activated'' which feel too orchestrated. I don't love the Banished cinematics that much, they feel unoriginal without any punch to them. They are regular enemies that serves their purpose, nothing more. Still, I did not finished the game still so maybe they will add some personality to them down the road. Also, the game seems laggy sometimes but maybe its my PC.

The multiplayer is a blast, a lot of replayability there.

It's a really good Halo game."

PullnPray,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"The best playing Halo game ever. The singleplayer campaign is mammoth, and traversing the open world with the grappling hook is a blast. Multiplayer is incredible. The best new feature is bots. If you are new to the series (or just not that good), you can still enjoy the multiplayer by creating your own custom games with nothing but bots.

There are a few things missing that hold this game back from being a 10. Forge, and SP Co-Op are to be added later. As well as additional maps and multiplayer modes. But what IS there is near perfection. This game manages to stay true to its roots, but also feel very fresh."

THIS game is incredible. My only with would be for more secrets and special events to be found in the world. Finding audio files just isn't very rewarding.

Voidedsoul,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"I hate giving it a 10 because it's not perfect but I am to counter the lying reviews. At it's worst it's an 8 at it's best it's a 9.5 (no game is perfect) all together I'd give it a 9.

The gameplay is damn near perfect, seriously it feels so good jumping, shooting, grappling and destroying the Banished.

More biomes would have been nice but it's not nearly as bad as others say. Admittedly I haven't finished the story but so far I'm really liking it. Finally Weapon and the pilot are getting way too much criticism. I actually like Weapon, she's fun. The pilot is a little whiny but fine.

Overall I'm excited to see how it ends and what 343 has in store for future content. Halo hasn't felt this good since Halo 3."

The gameplay is sooo repetitive! Basically, go there, fight some bad guys, and push a button. Rinse & repeat over & over again! By the last two boss fights I was so tired of battling the same enemies that I was really sick of the game. Maybe this is all you can expect from a game that’s so heavily focused on the multiplayer aspect. Overall, I just found the game to be uninteresting. I don’t think I’d ever play it again."

In my personal opinion, story-wise, it isn't better than any of the main Halo games created by Bungie, but it is the best one when it comes to gameplay and the sandbox experience. I really enjoyed my time with the campaign and I can't wait till they add the next campaign or release the next installment, not sure what they are going to do. Multiplayer-wise, I really enjoy it, has one of the best Halo experiences out of all the Halo games. Just wished they would add more gamemodes."

JBlack03,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"I’ve been a Halo fan for almost all of my life. Halo 2 is my favorite game of all time. After the Halo franchise was moved to be managed by 343, Halo games had felt a lot different. Especially the story. Not everything was bad but I know that Halo 4 and Halo 5 didn’t live up to the standards set by previous games. So let’s just say when I saw the slipspace engine trailer in 2019 with a return to the original art style, I knew I was buying this game. It did not disappoint, the Campaign was literally perfect, saving marines, taking down bounties, new abilities and weapons. The sandbox is one of my favorites in the franchise. The mystery of Zeta Halo and the story overall was the exact thing Halo needed to put itself on course to move towards a new direction whilst simultaneously respecting the stories told in every Halo game. Halos Campaign is my favorite one to date and I love it. I can’t wait until Co-OP is available. It will be the best!knew I was buying this game"

No interesting locations, everything is grey. One thing that pushes this game further is gun play. Every other things is mediocre."
deplorable,"Dec 11, 2021",7,"Storywise it's all over the place, a lot of veterans will notice slight retcons with some of the dialogue or things that don't make since. I think Halsey at one point talks about John being ready for something greater (except the spartans were made to kill rebel humans; the covenant, halos etc werent known at this point). It just feels forced. I can nuance the terrible plot lines better, i mean for scavengers the banished managed to build a laser that could break through unbreakable forerunner installations. See what i mean? or chief wakes up in space and the banished have won, but there's a signal close by which for some reason the banished have ignored until the chief makes his way there. It's just cringeworthy rubbish, bungie were never Shakespeare but at least they could write something coherent. 343 have yet to do that with any of their games.

Open world is a nice change though, except it's small (compared to a 10 year old game Skyrim or 4 year old breath of the wild). and pretty empty. Sure there's things to do like destroy propaganda towers (no not like farcry) which are small and take a few hits. I mean you can save marines, who can send out a distress signal but otherwise have no radio communication until chief is right next to them. (it's a shambles of a barely coherent storyline).

As for the indoor areas, they've kept with the repeating corridors and the same installation look as the original halo. I can't fathom why they would do this, as each installation (halo) weren't supposed to be identical but their creative ingenuity hasn't moved very far since they took the reigns from Bungie. Better the devil you know i guess.

We have destiny style bullet sponge bosses, which we all asked for... in the open world and campaign too. Yay. Don't expect like the first halo with intense beautifully written battle sequences with wraiths and grunts which feel like a real battleground. This is a hotchpotch mess which is supposed to feel organic but comes across as flat.

Graphics are nice, not remarkable but nice. A small increase from the previous halo game and the grapple hook makes fast travel and vehicles next to useless unless for a specific purpose or area. (you can reach the tallest mountain [there's an achievement] within less than 20 seconds grappling up).

There are lore things scattered around both covenant (sorry ""banished"") and human to pick up which are interesting but like fallout 76 it's a cheap way to avoid more story telling and cutscenes. The open world just feels like content without content. It's like a cheat. Gone are the linear giant levels which involve warthogs, scorpion tanks and intense battles through a 40 minute slog fest of wonder. Replaced by something, which again, feels off. It's fun, but lacks the intensity that the first few halos filled us with.

Nothing really new with gameplay, sure chief now has magical upgradable spartan armour and upgrades but bar the grappling hook nothing stands out. There are side missions where you destroy fuel dumps, or repair bays but offer no real incentive to complete. It's not cyberpunk 2077.

There are now more weapons than you can shake a stick at, and the covenant (sorry banished) now carry and use these weapons as well. Again, the tag line is scavengers except when the plot makes them out to be something more.

The action and nostalgia factor of playing as the chief (who seems to hold more secrets this time around [like magic]) is the only reason it still gets a 7. It's a welcome return, but certainly not the second coming.

Also someone has to talk about Health and Safety with the banished. Scavengers or not. There are more explosive crates than life forms in this game."

The only negative thing I could say about the campaign is the fact that the only way to replay missions is to restart the game, but they said they will fix that. The guns feel amazing, but I hope in the future we could see some old guns make a return, or maybe see some new weapons."

I just can’t stop smiling after seeing the credits roll"

Velass,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"Gráficos: Estão lindos, melhores do que a versão multiplayer, mas não ta no mesmo nível de forza horizon 5, afinal forza nesse quesito é insuperável no momento.

Jogabilidade: Está perfeita, é a melhor de toda a saga, tem algumas coisas como o arpel e os barris de plasma pelo cenário que mudam muito a gameplay.

Combate: É também um ponto forte do jogo, ele rivaliza com o halo 2 pelo titulo de melhor combate da série em minha opinião, ta muito fluido e divertido, a variedade de inimigos ta muito boa, a maneira como eles agem em combate, os brutes estão muito legais e tem diferentes tipos que atacam de diferentes formas. Os jackals são os mais dificeis, o escudo deles é muito difícil de quebrar com as armas humanas, precisa de arma de plasma ou elétrica pra quebrar mais fácil.

Chefes: Isso é um show a parte, casou muito com esse jogo ele ter chefes e as lutas são muito maneiras, cada uma é diferente e tem algumas que são muito difíceis mesmo, os banidos são ótimos antagonistas para o jogo.

Mundo aberto: É definitivamente lindo e deslumbrante, mas está vazio no nas primeiras horas de jogo, depois o jogo disponibiliza muitas outras atividades que despertam mais o interesse de explorar o mapa.

Personagens: Estão muito legais o piloto e a The weapon são muito divertidos, o chief tem mais personalidade e é até sarcástico e meio resmungão kkk e os personagens vilões também são bem intimidadores e o jogo faz você ficar com raiva e ter gosto em enfrentar eles.

Historia: Gostei bastante dos rumos que a historia tomou, mas não falarei demais aqui pra evitar spoilers.

Conclusão: Pelo que vi até agora esse halo ta no meu top 3 da franquia, ele tem muitas influencias legais, pega o contexto do halo 1, evolui o combate do halo 3, pega muito da ambientação e um pouco da verticalidade de Doom e o mundo aberto se inspira em far cry, mas ele conseguiu dosar tudo isso muito bem, quando você ta jogando a sensação é de halo, a influencia mais forte pra mim foi do halo 3.
Eu diria que até o momento superou minhas expectativas, sendo realmente um jogo infinitamente melhor que o halo 5 e principalmente que o 4 que pisava na bola em tudo menos nos gráficos."
Rexagon,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"What is not to like honestly?

Compared to Halo 5 its MUCH MUCH MUCH better!
Compared to the other rivals such as COD and BF, its MUCH MUCH MUCH better!
Compared to other fps games released in the last 5 years, its MUCH MUCH MUCH better!

+Graphics are amazing
+ Gameplay and feel is perfect, feels so smooth.
+ Story is actually good and makes sense compared to Halo 5.
+Dialogs and music are spot on
+Multiplayer is fun, Campaign is even more fun!

We wanted a good Halo game to begin with, and we got an amazing one, and i can without overreacting say that its the current best fps."

mstj32,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"Campaign is great! Easily, one of the best Halo Campaigns, might contend as the best campaign of the franchise. You honestly have to experience it for yourself. No doubt most will enjoy and probably love it though some will probably find somethings they don’t like about it. The choice of how you play and when you engage different parts of the game is up to you. A freedom that Halo games have always needed. This game does have a BOTW feel to it but they make its own.

Would be a 10 if the Multiplayer was more complete and didn’t have issues such as bad Battle Pass progression and bad pricing for cosmetics, desync, hit registration issues, lack of playlists, etc. The campaign makes up for issues with Multiplayer since Campaign is the paid portion.

What they give us for Multiplayer is the best FPS out this year. For all its issues it’s a lot of fun and when additional playlists/maps and issues are resolved this may end up being the Multiplayer of the decade."

isavax3,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"This is the best halo has been since halo 3 overall. It has potential to be the best halo imo if they start adding more maps and playlists, and work on the progression system, grinding challenges non stop is very annoying. MP gameplay wise is my favorite in the series, surpassing 3 imo. The campaign as well is a 9/10 for me, gameplay wise it's the most fun campaign in the series and although story wise, it doesn't quite hit the heights of 2, it's still one of the best stories in halo yet, some would argue the best(unsure if that's true for me yet), but it was a excellent story and ending, setting up more campaign dlc's. 9/10, certainly one of the best Halo's of all time."

Thwompthing,"Dec 11, 2021",9,"Absolutely love this Horizon: Zero Dawn style open world for Halo Infinite.  The world is not insanely massive like Skyrim or Witcher 3, thankfully.  It's smaller scaled like Horizon, which is a good thing.

This game is a total blast to play, and getting the collectible items isn't too much of a challenge and rewards gameplay.  The game still has huge chapters, which still feel like levels.  Everything here feels great.  Multiplayer is fun too.  Just hope there are more options in the future.

9/10 as the game is right now."

Gameplay, gunplay, level design, è tutto ben calibrato e l'ottima IA garantisce un livello di sfida altissimo, soprattutto se giocato a eroico o leggendario (alcuni boss sono frustranti però). Il ritorno delle musiche e dell'ambiente che bungie aveva creato mi ha davvero emozionato, si vede che 343 ha imparato dagli errori commessi in halo 5 e in parte in halo 4. Consigliatissimo."

BigGayLobster,"Dec 11, 2021",0,"Didn't think 343 was going to pull it off after the disappointment of  Halo 5, and the not so promising graphical nightmare that was the trailer they released a while back but, I can say that Halo Infinite feels and plays exactly how you would want a Halo game to play, while adding new and fresh mechanics. The campaign is very solid from the storytelling side and the gameplay.

The multiplayer is almost perfect if they fix the lackluster progression sysytem then not too much to complain about,"
kikin7,"Dec 11, 2021",10,"El juego es excelente, no me había divertido tanto en cuanto a campaña desde Halo 2 y el multijugador es exquisito, sin duda 343 Industries le dio al clavo (por fin!) y supo crear lo que los fans querían, una gran historia, un gameplay más clásico pero frenético.

Quizá la historia quedó a deber un poco por tantos años que estuvieron en desarollo pero si el juego durará 10 años sin duda el juego se irá actualizando en cuanto la historia.

El juego es de mundo abierto o semi abierto, no esperes jugar un Breath of the wild o GTA, la campaña es corta pero casi perfecta, con las misiones extra, los coleccionables y demás, el juego está para pasarse lento y disfrutar cada detalle, pelea y sobre todo el soundtrack. El mejor Halo que he probado sin duda alguna, bien hecho 343."

Tuaman,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Когда дело касается вкусов, а игры как ни крути, это то все субъективно, вкусовщина так сказать, не вижу смысла рвать на себе рубашку, доказывая оппоненту, что есть только мое мнение и только  оно является верным. И по дереву я растекаться здесь не намерен, доказывая всем, что игра эта очень и очень интересная. Скажу лишь одно, не доверяйте рейтингам, т.к. зачастую пользователи могут быть заангажированными. Смотрите, играйте. Эта игра, того стоит. Что мне понравилось в игре. Красивый мир. Да, он прекрасен, но не лишен некоторых изъянов. Дело в том, что он не то, чтобы пуст, в нем со временем, попросту  делать нечего. Зачистка аванпостов, убийство минибоссов, спасение отрядов, рано или поздно, все это начинает надоедать. Можно ли это отнести к недостаткам. Вопрос неоднозначный. По сути, игра не заставляет тебя следовать этой дорогой, т.к. все эти активности, не вплетены в сюжетную линию, и является так сказать дополнительным контентом. Не хочешь этим заниматься, можешь смело проходить мимо, но, право признаться, хочется получить улучшенный вариант определенной пушки, а выбить их можно с разыскиваемого минибосса  На этом недостатки, если их так можно сказать, заканчиваются. И на первый план встает очень интересная история, с харизматичными персонажами и невероятным геймплеем. Да, геймплей здесь в буквальном смысле сбивает с ног и засасывает вас в водоворот событий таинственного Ореола Зета. Устройства, которыми оснащен главный герой, механники, оружие, наконец спутница мастера Чифа, не  вызовут у вас приступ зевоты. Отдельно следует обратить внимание на стрельбу.  Да, кто-то будет сетовать, на то, что мол дескать, нет отдачи при стрельбе и я отчасти буду согласен, но только от части. Думаю, что такой ход было обусловлен введением кроссплатформенного формата в игре, дабы игроки с ПК, не имели существенного гандикапа перед игроками консоли. Но, как же оно тут ощущается. Это просто сказка, это песня. Берете в руки что-нибудь по тяжелее, будь-то дробовик Бульдог, снайперская винтовка, либо ракетница, выстрел и о чудо. Какая же тут мощь. Ее никами словами не передать. Она поражает своим эффектом. Теперь немного уделю внимание искусственному интеллекту. Я всегда считал мерилом высококачественного ИИ, игру на примере The Division 2. И когда я начинаю ""щупать"" ту или иную игру, всегда обращаю внимание на этот фактор, потому что хочется, чтобы ИИ не просто бежал на вас с открытым забралом, с автоматом на перевес, а проявлял хоть какую-то смекалку и тактику. Так вот, с ИИ в этой игре все впорядке. В общем, игра, которая покорила меня своей историей, внешней оболочкой,качественной стрельбой и некоторыми механниками. А если это так, а это именно так, то, что ещё нужно, для хорошего шутана?"

Y solo por aclarar que Halo nunca ha sido el mas referente a gráficos, Halo se trata de Gameplay, Historia, Diversion pero sobre todo de Amistad entre jugadores.

countscotula,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"The gameplay is absolutely masterful in this game. 30 seconds of fun perfected. The open world is large, beautiful and fun to explore, but it never feels overwhelming or too empty. The mix of open and linear levels keeps the campaign fresh. The enemies encounters are thought out and give you full freedom to approach each however you want. This is the best sounding game I've ever experienced period. The story pulled me in and made me feel just about every emotion possible. This is my favorite Halo campaign and that is saying a lot. I can't wait to see what comes next to build on this.

Franchement, le jeu est excellent. L'open World se marie merveilleusement bien avec Halo, et le grappin est une merveille. Ajoutez à cela des boss, des ""mini boss"" (les cibles sensibles), un système d'upgrade simple mais efficace, une technique excellente (framerate limpide, champs de vision à perte de vue, textures nickels, effets de particules superbes, ...), une bande son de folie, et une très bonne durée de vie (si on ne fait pas le jeu en ligne droite biensûr).

Le meilleur Halo de 343i c'est certain.
Dans les points négatifs, je mettrais qu'ils auraient pu mettre des biomes diffférents, et aller beaucoup plus loin dans leurs idées (je pense notamment aux marines qu'on sauve au cours du jeu, ça aurait du avoir un impact sur la campagne en ajoutant une partie stratégie), varier beaucoup plus les missions annexes (on tombe vite dans le déjà vu).

Maintenant à eux de confirmer l'essai en bonifiant l'aventure. Les bases sont posées pour un retour en force de Halo."

theHunter99,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"My favorite Halo so far. The semi-open world, side quests, and just plain fun this game offers are great. It feels like the Halo I love, but with some new modes and challenges. It’s hard to stop playing and I keep going back for more. 343 should be commended for their efforts. This is one of my favorite games of the new generation to this point. It’s just that good. Don’t listen to the haters, give this game an honest play through and you’ll be smiling."
dcotto00,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"This is my first time writing a review for a game.
Long time Halo fan, started Halo CE in 2007 and now own all of them.  This game manages to capture the magic in its game play and campaign structure.  It avoids the excesses of Halo 5's ""avengers"" feeling and puts humanity back in a desperate plight, as is right for the Halo universe.  Master Chief seems to be in character, terse as ever, but in a deeper way, though avoiding Halo 4's excesses.  Infinite takes large inspiration from the Bungie titles; it uses a method reminiscent of Halo 3's Cortana ""memory sequences"" to tell of the fate of Cortana after Halo 5, and nicely ties up that plot's messiness.  Given the mess and radical departures of Halo 5, they couldn't have done much better than they did in this follow-up.
Thank goodness the forerunner enemy types have been entirely removed, other than the sentinels and their variants.
And thank goodness for a return to the old art style.
I liked both the Pilot and the Weapon reasonably well.
I appreciated the commitment to a no-cut camera.  It worked powerfully.
I played on a base Xbox One and the performance was, given the constraints, fantastic.  I only encountered two mild bugs in my playthrough.

There are some problems, I think.  The third act has a pacing issue and needs some pauses where you can explore the open-world to better space out the content.   The Harbinger didn't connect with me, and just as far as aesthetic choices, I don't think her design belongs in Halo.  I'm curious to see where the plot will go IRT to her and her plans, though, so I suppose she worked *okay.*

Good job 343i.  Stay on this track.
By far the best effort by 343i.  A wonderful achievement.  The leap to open world for Halo couldn't have been done better--preserving both Halo's unique feel as well as advancing it.  Good job."
d4ga,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"i really didnt have so much expectatives over halo infinite due the horrible games that 343 used to develop, but i really have enjoyed this one. Maybe is just that i am very nostalgic because the game feels like a halo 2, but i must say that halo infinte is awesome mostly the campaign but also the multiplayer is very adictive. After the big disappointment that was halo 4 and halo 5 this is a great game whit a great history strongly recommended"

One, the traditional Halo, is your typical, large, nice apple. Pretty good. Infinite, on the other hand, is a smaller, juicier apple so full of flavor it leaves you wanting for more. It'll take time fo this to reach the same level of magnitude as its predecessors. But at its core, it far outshines them."

Wez00,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"This halo is a fair better improvement to the pervious halos released by 343 (4 and 5). I would say it is the top 3 halos I have played but this game would never be better than halo reach. Reach is my favourite at the moment then it goes halo 3 and this. It is kinda funny on the negative reviews on this games where they do not explain on the reason why it has been given a bad rating. People says the story is crap, it has got microtransactions and it is worst than battlefield 2042 bah bah bah.

Let get this right, Battlefield 2042 pays their  consumers a lot of money to buy a game where there is only multiplayer and it is buggy no campaign. With halo you play the multiplayer for free and the money you pay for the campaign it worth the experience. When you review a game do not say a lot of rubbish about it , bring facts to the table, true they are elements that do need improving such as the microtransactions but games these days that are popular such as COD, Battlefield, FIFA, Gears etc, they have them but you do not have to spend money for the experience unless you want to customises your gaming.

I just find it pointless for people who are from PlayStation Pc user or new user review bombing  on a game where they do not like it. If you do not like the game fair enough but do not input bad reviews just of sake of it. i will give this game a 8/10. I have inputted 10 on this review just to sort out the rating it deserves."

jjatindranath,"Dec 10, 2021",0,"Mechanics and graphics are mostly great. Campaign was good but missing common things such as a chapter select option and co-op. Quick resume on Xbox Series X is broken and can stop you from getting some unlockable items.

The multiplayer is a mess at the moment. Battle pass has slow progression with not many rewards worth playing for, most of which are consumables which don't add to the experience. No ability to choose what mode you play, so its all random. Limited game modes - no free for all, zombies, forge, etc. Your fireteam isn't necessarily the team you'll end up playing with, sometimes gets mixed up. No ability to turn off cross-play, important because PC is being plagued by hackers who you can't report in-game. Overpriced cosmetics. Barely any customization options when compared to previous games. Points scored and winning doesn't matter. No stats. The list goes on. For a game that's been in development for six years, I am very disappointed and hope for a dense patch to fix a number of issues."
cjud1e,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"They have really nailed the Halo feeling, and boosted it.  It starts off on levels that are classically  Halo.

I even find my self cracking up at the ambient dialog.  Wonderful game so far."

Luthbel,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Multiplayer perfecto. Todos los juegos FPS online deben revisar su formato y aprender de este Halo Infinite, pues los mejora en todos los aspectos.

Campaña excelente, con momentos realmente memorables. Lo que me ha gustado, como novato en la saga Halo, es que no necesitas haber jugado ningún otro juego de Halo, aunque da ganas de jugarlos, cosa que haré cuando acabe con este. Ha sido una buena idea por parte de 343I, pues mucha gente nueva se sentiría perdida en una ambientación enorme, como a mí me ocurrió con Halo 3, el cual abandoné poco después de empezarlo.

El juego te obliga a pensar, pues los enemigos se organizan, no puedes ir a saco, te rodean y te destrozan.  Lo estoy jugando a dificultad normal, habiendo jugado 1/3 de la campaña, pero por lo que me cuenta gente que lo está jugando en modos más difíciles, la IA mejora exponencialmente con cada nivel de dificultad. Como digo, la IA en dificultad normal ya es muy elevada, por encima de la mayoría de juegos, y sólo me he encontrado con un par de enemigos ""perdidos"", que se quedan alelados cuando mueren sus compas. Cuando están en grupo, actúan en grupo, y si hay un mini jefe, le dice a las tropas básicas cómo tienen que proceder para emboscarnos.

La sensación con las armas es brutal, muy inmersiva, lo cual mejora todavía más con uno de los mejores sonidos 3D que he probado desde que salió la nueva generación de consolas.

El juego peca un poco de repetitivo en lo referente a escenarios al aire libre, pero sabiendo cuál es el futuro del juego, es de esperar que lleguen nuevos biomas con cada una de las campañas que irán publicando en los próximos meses/años. No se trata de un juego al uso con secuelas, sino una base que irá creciendo a lo largo de la generación.

Algo parecido ocurre con el aspecto técnico. 343I ha desarrollado el juego a la par con el motor gráfico. Un trabajo mastodóntico que les ha dado muchos problemas en el desarrollo. Ahora ya están ambas cosas, y a la vez que incluirán nuevo contenido, irán mejorando y puliendo aspectos del propio motor gráfico. Si juegas esto un par de años tras el lanzamiento, seguramente el juego luzca mucho mejor que en el propio lanzamiento, es algo que ocurre cuando la intención es expandir el contenido, y no abandonar el juego tras el season pass, cosa que ocurre con otros muchos juegos.

He dudado sobre qué puntuación ponerle al juego. Al empezar este texto pensé en ponerle un 9, pero creo que merece un 9,5, pendiente de volver a visitarlo en un par de años. Por ello, le pongo un 10 condicional. No me gusta puntuar algo ""para compensar"" los 0 que pone gente que ni lo ha jugado ni lo jugará, pero ponerle un 9 y no un 10 pecaría también de injusticia por mi parte. Así que toma, un 10 redondo"

GigaVega,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Halo Infinite is the best Halo experience in a long time. Halo 5 was mediocre and while I liked halo 4. It still wasn’t as good as my favorite halo  game Halo 2. Infinite was a breath of fresh air returning Halo to its glory days. The look, The feel, and the gameplay the characters feel like bungie made it themselves to me. Pre destiny bungie I wouldn’t want current bungie within a 10 ft radius of Halo now. For me Halo infinite is now on par with halo 2 for my favorite Halo. The only issues is monetization in multiplayer and the lack of a crossplay toggle. I was going to put lack of game modes but 343 is adding the ones people want minus infection on Tuesday so I’m satisfied in the aspect now. And dont let those negative reviews fool you it’s just a bunch of no life Sony ponies who can’t handle Xbox is putting out good games and taking all the attention away from PlayStation."

Logan_4201,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"The game is very enjoyable but there’s a few things I didn’t enjoy.
Campaign 1.Shock Weapons make air vehicle combat very frustrating 2. Hunters are bullet sponges, but I like the challenge.
3.Forerunner interiors feel a little copy pasted, although they’re exquisite.
Multiplayer 1. Server lag is pretty bad, I don’t usually lag in games but I do in infinite.  2. The spawn system for vehicles in BTB is a good idea poorly executed, I barely see tanks at all lol.
3. Progression system is underwhelming but not the biggest deal.
4. The customization is fairly restricted with the Amor Cores and Kits.
5. It cost $20 for a set of armor in the store, so that means 3 sets of armor is equivalent too a full priced game, what kinda BS is that??

Other than those few problems I really enjoyed the game and would say it lives up to the legend from H3."

Mano_,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Halo infinite tem uma boa historia narrativa como era na época dos halos da bungie, e a parte de combate do jogo é incrível, eu diria que um dos melhores se não o melhor no cenário do fps, a liberdade que o jogo te da é incrivelmente balanceada, quando eu vou jogar outros jogos que te dão a liberdade de explorar o mapa eu me incomodo de mais, porque são milhares de ícones na tela e isso tira minha vontade de explorar, mas com halo é diferente, ele vai te dando novas missões secundarias ao avançar da sua jornada, e uma coisa que se encaixou muito bem com halo foi a implementação das ""habilidades"" porque combina com halo, diferente do que houve com halo 5, e essas ""habilidades"" fazem muita diferença nas batalhas de chefes, porque vai ter chefes que ficam invisíveis, outros vão ser mais brutos e outros vão utilizar armas pra te combater de grandes distâncias.
Recomendo halo infinite pra qualquer um, esse é o melhor que joguei esse ano até o momento"

Kh117aa,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"The story is incredible, the ""open"" world is perfect (although there are very few errors in terms of floating textures) the stuffed animals hidden in the highest points are beautiful, the difficulty is almost perfect although it is not at the level of halo 2 or halo 4 which are the ones that I consider with the highest degree of difficulty in legendary (halo infinite difucultad 9.5, halo 2 and 4 difucultad 10), the progesion is very good, the marines now if they are a support, the bosses have the perfect degree of difficulty ( you have to use your brain), although something bad in the voice of the pilot in Latin American Spanish does not fit 100, the dialogues and phrases are very memorable and the weapons are very well balanced qualification of a follower of the saga for more than 13 9.7 years a great job by 343 ""the third is the charm"""
Gimpyman,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Hey man it’s Johnny Halo what more could you want babbyyy. But really, it is addicting and the gameplay is tight. The story is dripped in as needed which is all you really need and the atmosphere takes over from there. Taking over fobs and strong holds is fun and difficult at times but you feel powerful and strategic when it all comes together just right. I only wish they staggered the strong holds a little better, in terms of how many enemies at once you can trigger. On occasion you can accidentally walk your way into waking up a hole base, but this isn’t always the case and most of the time baddies are locked up behind their security gates until you bring ‘em down. Also I wish they had gone and made them bases a bit more varied other then “Giant Steel Cage of Enemies 3” or whatever iteration your on. But grabbing a batch of pipe hittin marines who spit these jokes, tossin em in a vehicle, and slapping up some space orcs with the boys is a blast. Minor gripes: Light hearted tone of marines can kind of conflict with the tone of the story sometimes. Also driving feels very boat-like and also a small pebble can upend you. Scorpion driving is so difficult it’s almost not worth it. 10/10 though because this game deserves a higher meta score then it has for sure"

Bungie had Halo down to a science, but then 343 came, and didn't know how to handle Halo 4 and Halo 5, the story for 5 was the worst in my opinion. But oh my god, Halo Infinite, 343 really redeem themselves in my eyes, they finally get how Halo works. I hope there is more story dlc planned in the future.

The multiplayer is solid, best gameplay in the franchise hands down. But the lack of playlist, progression system and the lackluster microtransactions (15 dollars for a grenade pineapple really?) makes this a 9 for me. It would have been a 10 if it wasn't for these things. Even with the game's flaws, I'm still addicted, and have played every day since the beta released. Good job 343, now fix what needs to be fix."
Dh4rkX,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"Ill be honest here, the game is not perfect by any means, some stuff needs some tweaking like the progression and armor customization, but putting those aside the gameplay feels a mix of the good from halo 3, and the good from halo 4 and 5. there is sprint however it is tweaked to play well with all the maps and not being too overpowered, clamber is here but crouch jumping is still viable to cancel the clamber animation. equipment makes a return and is better than ever, MOST EQUIPMENT have the purpose of mobility and other actions, for example - grappleshot can be used to grapple to heights, BUT you can also grapple weapons, objectives, and even onto players for your advantage.

Campaign i cannot give my opinion on, as i do not own it but the multiplayer is solid"

Not a fan of the free MP model but whilst I critique them for that, it's unfortunately a sign of the times and Halo absolutely has to be a success for them as their flagship title, free to play and monetisation is the model today."

Irorieh,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Normally I would rank this as a 9, but given the frankly embarrassing amount of review bombing going on, I'm upping this one to a ten.

Infinite is a solid entry into the Halo saga, bringing the series classic gameplay into the open world, which comes off perfectly. Halo has always had levels which have demonstrated the potential the series had for such design (Arriving on Halo, Silent Cartographer, Delta Halo, Quarantine Zone and The Ark come to mind) so it's no surprise that this is the case. The only surprise really is how well 343 executed this.

In terms of graphics, the game is definitely improved from where it was when displayed. The return to a more classic Halo art style is much appreciated, particularly in minor details around the ring, which draw clear inspiration from the original games. Is it the most beautiful game I've ever played? No. But I don't play games to pretend I'm watching a movie, so it's all good."
RichAMD,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Es la primera vez que juego Halo, yo no soy fan de los juegos de disparos en primera persona, vi mucha gente con hype sobre este juego y dije... voy a intentarlo.... de TODOS los juegos shooter que he probado este ha sido el unico (por el momento) que me ha enganchado....

LIVE_SUPREMACY,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Halo Infinite is 343 Industries best halo series game to date. The multiplayer is so fun to play and its Free-To-Play. They take what made old halo multiplayer game good and touch it up with best features from newer halo multiplayer. Halo Infinite campaign is open world on the Zeta Halo Ring. You have upgradable abilities like the new grappling hook that you can swing and climb up with. The storyline is good but some of the story seems to be left open for later. Some features modes like CO-OP and Forge will be added at a later date. I played every Halo since Halo:Combat Evolved on Original Xbox. Halo Infinite is a must play!

Not to mention, the battles are all very fun and the Grapple Shot brings a whole new layer to battles. The open world is really fun as well and reminds me of games like Farcry where you have outposts to go control. I find I want to play this constantly!
Multiplayer is also a hit. Could use a few other game modes and glad to hear SWAT is coming soon. Even with what it already has, I find myself cheering and having a great time battling other Spartans."
aaronjf94,"Dec 10, 2021",10,The story has been emotional i have really enjoyed the new characters and they've got a way better more open level to travel on and get stuff done. But they didn't overdue it i've liked that it isn't like a farcry kind over open world. 10 means it's exceeded my expectations. The complaint i have is that it ends a little too abruptly. That is not that big of a bother to me because more is coming.
AlexJYgames,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"Creo que es el tercer mejor Halo que he jugado en mi vida solo por debajo de Halo Reach y Halo 2, y realmente vale la pena, la jugabilidad es la mejor de la franquicia, la historia es exelente, el mundo abierto esta bien implementado y no es innecesariamente grande, los personajes son memorables y el multijugador es el mejor de toda la Saga superando al de Reach que me parecia el mejor, un juego muy bien hecho y le pongo un 9 solo porque faltan algunas cosas como la campaña cooperativa y el forge, pero de resto esta exelente, combina lo mejor que ha hecho Bungie y 343I."

The open world gives you a lot to do and a lot of reasons to do those things (to get cooler stuff to take out enemies more creatively). The game relies heavily on its sandbox, which is great because it is the best Halo sandbox yet. The multiplayer is fun. It is empty though. Hopefully the new playlists come quick. I really recommend the game, especially the campaign, there is a lot of fun to be had. Even more when co-op comes. The story is good. Nice and solid and the development of characters feels good.

TheAnonymousUSR,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"I thought that the mistake of Halo 5 would be repeated, an excellent mp and a bad campaign, but I was completely wrong Halo Infinite has a very good campaign, it is emotional and epic, it reminded me when I played Halo CE as a child. The multiplayer is very fun and addictive. Without any doubt the name is perfect because Halo is Infinite!"
chocolatedude,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Had an absolute blast, game was so worth the wait. 343 did a great job. Playing again on legendary currently."
Funkyman3,"Dec 10, 2021",9,It's a new take on halo that has the fun and feel of classic games with a very fun to explore open world. The grapple hook makes you feel the same kind of thrill as playing spiderman and really alters the way you can approach combat and your path through the world. However the marine ai could use some work. They get stuck on rocks and cannot drive like they could in previous titles. The waypoints when used to mark collectibles often attach to the wrong elevation or place. But those are really the only two issues I've had that have hindered my enjoyment of nonstop gameplay.
FiguraCrazy,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Os Sonystas estão com inveja porque temos jogos nesse Holiday, fora a pilha de pendências do Gamepass. Halo Infinite é espetacular, desde sua jogabilidade até seus gráficos. Sua direção de arte é linda e lembra os jogos da trilogia original, várias armas novas, ambientes de mundo aberto e dublagem excelente e engraçada. Chupa Sonystas!"

PressX,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"An Amazing HALO chapter. The open world fit perfectly to every element of this massive and successful franchise.
The gunplay is not only the best of Halo games but one of the best in all time too."
POTRG,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"Fantastic game that completes the technologically held back vision of an open world Halo that Bungie always wanted to create. 343 has successfully righted the ship after Halo 4 and 5 with an incredible multiplayer (flawed with progression), and an incredible single player that is my favorite in the series."
PedroPR117,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"This game It's very beautiful.

kefka2589,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"All in all, it's both a return to form and something new all at once. The gameplay and world are both spot on and Halo really feels like Halo again. I'm not bothered by the ""lack of features"" compared to previous entries, because while maybe some classic features aren't quite ready, there's new features here that previous games didn't have such as the open world or an MP mode that's F2P. It's currently in a state of give and take, but it was said all along that the game was to be built upon for years to come. What 343 has managed to deliver is a rock-solid foundation for the future of the franchise. We live in the era of live games now. The package is plenty complete enough to serve as a good starting point. I'm absolutely looking forward to future expansions and updates for the multiplayer."

Originals_uk,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Halo Infinite is a blast to play and the campaign is excellent with a great story and even better gameplay, The Multiplayer is also very fun considering that it is free to play and it seems that 343 industries is taking suggestions from the community very seriously which is something important as lots of other video game Developers just don't seem to care.

This game deserved a 90+ on Metacritic as it is very fun and showcases what is great about the Halo series,

It isn't a perfect game however with enough community feedback and fixes it will be one of the best Xbox games.

10/10."
JGids,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"The Campaign goes back to the roots of Combat Evolved and the Multiplayer shares many of the best aspects of each Halo multiplayer and compiles them all into one extremely fun package. The cons at the moment (which I’m sure will be resolved down the line) include the lack of multiplayer playlists/content, issues with progression, absence of Forge at launch, and unfortunately no Campaign coop at launch either. Nonetheless, I’ve played every single Halo and Halo Infinite has to be some of the most fun I’ve had with the series since Reach. Can’t wait to see where it goes from here."
Jackio24,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Best Halo yet hands down. I’ve been waiting for a halo like this since Reach and forge world.

Velghelm,"Dec 10, 2021",0,"Almost empty plot. The authors simply forgot about what happened before. There are no memorable characters and interesting plot twists.
The artificial intelligence of enemies is overestimated, in 2001-2004 it was cool, for 2021 it was already weak. Previous generation graphics, just higher resolution. The physics of the encirclement in the open world is almost absent; the trees look especially amusing, which do not react to a tank entering them. An empty and uninteresting open world. Terrible optimization on PC. The game is not worth the money that is asked for it, it is very boring to play."
kazshi23,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Great game. Everything I hoped for from a halo game

AdmiralKatz,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"El trabajo de 343 es increíble, al jugar se siente como si volviese a una partida de tiroteo de reach, hay cosas que te dan un sentimiento de nostalgia y al mismo tiempo sientes emoción por cada cosa nueva que surge, no entiendo la crítica a la historia, si es simplemente fascinante, la inclusión de nuevos personajes, el desarrollo de los mismos es fascinante, e leído por ahí, una historia hueca, vaya no sé de dónde sacan eso."

Quellyford,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"This game rightfully was voted Game of the Year by the fans at The Game Awards. The devs have pulled off some pure magic by making old fans and new fans happy. Gameplay is the best it's ever been, story and artwork is amazing, music is stunning, and multiplayer is addictive and fun. As this game continues to evolve, it could end up being the game of the generation. Congratulations to all who created this game, and wishing the best to everyone from creators to players!"
CommanderRico,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Fantastic game that’s arguably the best halo campaign made. As a fan since the original in 2001 this is the game that fans deserved after the poor Halo 5. Been engrossed in the game ever since it released, the art style is perfect unlike halo 5 and the scope is the largest campaign yet. The multiplayer plays like a dream and is extremely balanced, the only bad thing I can say about the game is it’s multiplayer progression everything else is spot on!!"
ZirShadow,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Tremendo juegazo que se aventó 343, la historia aunque aparente ser corta realmente hay mucho que hacer durante y después de la campaña, el diseño de personajes me encanto y espero que sigan evolucionando con este increíble juego. El propio juego te va dando contexto de todo lo que ha sucedido previo al mismo juego, para que sepas quien eres y quienes son los que te acompañan. El único punto malo que se le puede ver es que aún no hay modo cooperativo, pero no es la gran cosa."
AbaddonR,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"MP is pure gold and the campaign, while I was afraid of it turning into open world ish, something Ubisoft etc made sure I got extremely sick of, it's just fun and not a boring huge pointless mess. Plus completely skipable if you want to go straight for the main missions. Amazing experience and very happy it was so we'll excecuted."

imperius_mortis,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Brilliant!

Takes a timeless formula and enhances the experience. The classic elements are near on perfect, whilst the open world is interesting, fun and engaging.

This is the perfect showcase of why a game is better to be delayed, than rushed out of the door.

I think 343 have nailed this formula and I’m very excited to see what the future holds!"
Kizit,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Without a doubt my favorite Halo campaign. The game takes from all of its predecessors and asks “which Halo game do you wanna play?”. Do you wanna play it super linearly? Sure go ahead. Do you wanna spend your time exploring every nook and cranny of a vast open world. No one is gonna stop you. Do you want a mix of both? Well that just might be the best way to play. Too that off with stellar gunplay and a fantastic story you have not only the best 343 Halo games but one of the best Halo games ever.
Antoniio,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Me gustó mucho, el jefe lo hicieron ver más humano y no una máquina de matar, me gustó mucho la IA. La historia me gustó mucho ya que me recuerda a las entregas anteriores como halo 3, halo 4 y halo ce y la banda sonora muy bonita, me gustó también la jugabilidad, los gráficos se nota que se esforzaron."
DanckerTV,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"Fun gameplay, excellent graphics, good story, the ring is beautiful, AI are competent, the audio and sounds are wonderful. That's Halo Infinite. The only bad thing is the difficulty, only that. Really must play.
If you don't like the story of this Halo, play the other ones in Halo: TMCC, I know you will love it."

TheDoxZ,"Dec 10, 2021",8,"Es en verdad un juego muy bueno, se nota que aprendieron del pasado con halo 5 dándonos una campaña muy buena y un multijugador excepcional, aun faltan cosas por añadir al juego y retocar otras pero la experiencia al jugarlo es más que satisfactoria, el juego en general innova pero se siente familiar a la vez, en resumen un juego excepcional."

Harbringer,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"This is probably the best Halo since 3. The new open world is insanely fun to explore and the boss fights add flavor to old enemies. The multiplayer is great, despite still being a beta."
bearcox,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"The base gameplay is incredible and fun from top to bottom and the campaign is the best its ever been. This is a true rebirth of Halo and I am all for it. Though some fixes are needed when it comes to the shop, customizations and progression those are all fixable in coming updates. I do hope that 343 can stick to their promises and add more maps dlc and playlists as we go forward. We saw how well they did with MCC I am more than confident they will do good by Infinite and we already have a incredibly fun base game to play."
masterX93,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"No le hagan caso a las personas que ni lo jugaron 20 minutos y son fans tóxicos de otras consolas entonces insultan el juego
lo digo como fanatico de Halo desde hace años, este es el mejor juego de halo en la historia
aqui nos vamos mucho tiempo después de halo 5, el jefe maestro descubre que cortana fue eliminada y hará lo posible para saber lo que sucedio mientras un nuevo enemigo quiere conquistar el anillo

creo que eso seria mi resumen de lo que veras en este juego pero la verdad tiene muchas cosas buenas.
los gráficos son preciosos cuando exploras Zeta Halo
la jugabilidad es sencilla pero hermosamente cómoda
la historia es lo que quieres ver en un halo Y MAS

En cuanto el multijugador
es simplemente PERFECTO, la jugabilidad es un tanto distinta a la de la campaña pero eso no lo hace menos, es preciosa y cómoda, te sientes un verdadero Spartan
En cuanto el pase de batalla y la tienda tengo cosas que decir
los precios de la tienda son un poco caros para lo que son aunque ya dijeron que iban a arreglarlo
y el pase es muy bueno y te recompensa por tus esfuerzos
el sistema de nivelar fue arreglado aunque aun no esta completo
Listas de juego: hasta ahora solo se han visto las principales:Bola Loca, Slayer , Captura la Bandera , Fortalezas ect
pero faltan algunos que avisaron que van a poner como SWAT, Infection ect

Resumen:PRUEBA HALO INFINITE! vale totalmente la pena, recuerda que el multijugador esta gratis y la campaña cuesta alrededor de 1200 pesos mexicanos, también incluido por game pass

10/10"

Now onto my actual real live review. I'm 47 and have played Halo since CE way back in 2001. Halo Infinite definitely gives off Halo CE vibes and I can dig it. I spent most of my day off yesterday tackling the campaign it is was great fun. New weapons, finding skulls, refreshed gameplay. This game is amazing! Ignore the fake reviews, the campaign is easily a 9 out of 10."

The grapple changes the dynamic of the sandbox in campaign in such a great way it feels like it should have always been there. The gun play and overall gameplay in multiplayer should be the new standard for FPS games. This is not a perfect game, but it is great."

Shellhead,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"This is the best Halo game since Halo 3. I have been playing Halo since the OG Xbox launce. It was the first game I purchased and played. I have been a life long fan and I was very worried about Halo Infinite since the 2019 demo. Thankfully 343 delivered a master piece ****. The gameplay is so fluid and responsive and the grappling hook adds another level to the combat loop. The enemy AI is the best it has been since Halo CE. Its balanced and fair. The open world, works so well with Halo and I am very excited to see what the next 10 years of Halo will look like. As for the story, I have seen a few complaints and I will admit, that new comers will be a little lost but they will understand the story. I enjoyed the story and the performances from the Master chief, the weapon and the pilot are excellent. If you are a fan of Halo you will love this game."
Rar0,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"Halo Infinite is a return to form for the franchise. Is it a perfect game? no, it has several problems that have to be addressed, like the progression system and a somewhat small sandbox when compared to previous games.
Halo infinite is breathtaking and a treat for old and new fans alike."
Lexandro,"Dec 10, 2021",1,"After two hours of wandering through the same corridors, I got out into the open world, and this is the worst open world in video games I've played. The game offers you nothing but clearing bases from opponents and listening to audio recordings. Nothing else. It comes to the point of absurdity when even in story missions you are forced to do a sweep from time to time! The absence of at least some action, an unremarkable story, an empty open world. The only positive thing in the game is shooting. I just don't know what else to praise the game for."
MomoMakerIV,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"El mejor juego de Halo en toda la historia, una carta de amor hacia el género FPS, su historia y soundtrack hace este juego aún mejor y ahora su jugabilidad lo hace más que perfecto, esto sin duda es el mejor juego del año de Xbox."
LuneyN,"Dec 10, 2021",8,"The Gameplay is probably my favourite out of all the halo games, 343 has absolutely nailed it. The story is the best of 343's halo titles but still has a few short comings, It sets up a lot and i'm excited to see where Halo goes next which I haven't been able to say in years."
anida1,"Dec 10, 2021",10,The campaign is shaping up to be the best in the series. The multiplayer is a very solid foundation for what can be years of casual and competitive gameplay. I’m loving everything about it so far!
JosueCalderon,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Halo Infinite is an experiment, being an experiment as it is for the franchise, entering the open world mode will have deficiencies, as a staunch fan of the saga I recognize them, perhaps this ring world is not as alive as possible, and you will find that the Difficulty is not that demanding, however, without a doubt it will remind you of the Halo of yesteryear and that is something incredible because it takes elements that captivated the saga, an incredible amount of species of the Outcasts, an incredible campaign the best that 343 has done , so it may not be the best Halo game, but it definitely passes the criteria by far to become a memorable piece in the Xbox catalog"

OnMyXman,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"This is easily the game of the year. Visuals that rivals that of RE8, Ratchet and Clank, Returnals etc, but gameplay that outclasses the other contenders. This is arguably the best gameplay from any Halo game, and I would legitimately argue it has some of the best gameplay from any FPS ever. Smooth gameplay, excellent gunplay and great environments."
War_Master,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"A master piece, the campaign is full of action and sentimental moments, the side missions as the liberation of the FOBs are unique and the hunt for collectionables are pretty funny, grappling yourself to new places and towards your goal us a great addition to the game. Even if the game is not complete (because it will be updated with more expansions) it feels like a full complete game that you can spend hours not only stopping the banished, or searching for a multiplayer unlockable, also appreciating the beauty of zeta Halo.
The multiplayer, therefore is another tale, the unranked modes are pretty funny and never is lacking of action. The ranked matches proves your skill.
the only “bad” point is the very slow progression in the battlepass, but I trust that the community take this more like a challenge than oyher thing.

Сделали мы они весь упор на коридорный шутер добавив больше механик и разнообразия, то цены бы просто им не было, а так потраченное время на открытый мир себя не оправдало. К мультиплееру вообще претензий 0 он тебя затягивает с головой. В принципе он и вытягивает минусы компании и действительно делает эту игру крутой."

CJGomez,"Dec 10, 2021",10,The game campaign is phenomenal. This is Halo story that continues to set a standard of great story telling with gameplay. The environment is amazing and full of detail. Master Chief is back at the focus with the AI and pilot and the story really drives home what makes Halo special.
Sharky7612,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"if you have the money get it, both the campaign and multiplayer are fine perfect, while there might be some issues with the multiplayer cosmetics, it doesn't take away from the experience. halo infinite is the true successor to halo 3"
Krakenxx,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Definitely the highest quality triple A product released this year. The sonyboys who set the game 0 with their blazing ass make me laugh
Wicho935,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Juegazo lo mejor de todo son las combinaciones y libertad que te da a la hora de un combate y la historia es interesante además de que explorar el mapa es entretenido
StewartDamien,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"All I can say is wow! Halo Multiplayer was fantastic, The Campaign was the icing on the cake, I have put 10 hours into it so far, the open world is beautiful & is a huge return to form for the Halo franchise I was sceptical at first given the trailer released last year, but Microsoft & 343 did something unheard of after the backlash they actually postponed the release to make this game as great as it could possibly be & it shows, The graphics are true next gen with an insane amount of content this is legit a GOTY contender"
Goldos13,"Dec 10, 2021",10,It's a incredible game... The campaign it's so interesting and the soundtrack ooooooooooh nostalgic It's beautiful

JAce83,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"I’ve been waiting to be blown away by Halo for years and Halo Infinite did just that. The pacing, the exploratory nature and overall fun of the game makes this my favorite game in years"
armel_martinez,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Great game on both campaign and online.  343 picked a good decision on deciding to put an extra year into it. It really paid off!! Loving the classic feel campaign.
THSpictures,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"I give a 10! Why ? Because a lot of people here rate a game badly what they haven't played at all. I have now finished the campaign. Actually, I would play the game 9 give. Because yes, I would have wished for two or three things, but the game turned out to be the best halo by far. everything is reminiscent of the first part. many things are clearer now. the open world offers a lot for people from the Halo universe. I wasn't bored for a minute. the soundscape in the world is that hammer"
CarlosPino,"Dec 10, 2021",8,"Es un gran juego, el mundo abierto tiene un gran potencial que supieron aprovechar, los enemigos e interacciones con el mundo son una de las mejores."

aduenopr,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Amazing, more than I expected!!! the audio, gameplay, hope to see more for the campaign on a DLC."
Nitbuntu,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"I’ve never played Halo 5, but this latest offering is as close to classic Halo we can expect. However, the numerous additional QOL improvements together with modern graphical fidelity means that this is probably the best Halo available.
Now that co-op campaign and multiplayer modes are fully featured, I can now give this full marks.
It’s also the first time that I’ve genuinely enjoyed and look forward to playing Halo multiplayer, as previously I was a campaign guy!
All in all this this a top class game that will only get better as improvements are made and new features and content added."
LadiesMan217,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"Woah! What a world 343 has crafted. The gunplay is fantastic and addictive, with the story pulling you in. You'll feel like a hero as you liberate marines and upgrade your weapons and abilities. It's really fantastic and reminds you of what you first loved about Halo. I have no complaints, the -1 is for the pay-to-look-pretty in MP."
pjerkan,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Just as good as the Halo games i grew up with.
Wasn’t expecting this game to be as good as it is even tho i had very high expectations."
Simie,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Halo is back! I've been playing the multiplayer beta a lot over the last few weeks and it brings back memories of the classic halo games but modernised to the times. Mainly focusing on campaign the last couple of days and it's amazing. Loving the more open sandbox style - so much fun!
Stephkitty23,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"If you are a Halo fan, this is the game you've been waiting for.  I wasn't a huge fan of Halo 5.  4 wasn't bad, but 5 seemed like a huge departure.  Halo Infinite seems to be going back to it's roots, with it's look and feel, the gameplay is top notch, and the graphics are great for a cross-gen game.

I couldn't give it a full 10 because, although the game itself (Campaign and Multiplayer) are amazing, It doesn't get a perfect score from me due to the missing co-op option for Campaign, and the Battlepass progression needs work.  Those two aren't as important to me and since the MP is Free to Play, one point is all i'm deducting.  Otherwise, it's a solid game, and on Gamepass day one it's a no brainer.

Don't trust any of the few negative reviews here. Anyone who gave this game a 0 is outright just hating on it."
Detolito058,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"El juego se siente bastante bien , el mundo semi abierto le da un sabor de boca muy agradable , la narrativa es interesante y mejor que la entrega anterior , el multijugador es divertido y más si juegas con amigos"

VanshAwasthi200,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Just a breath of fresh air in a world full of cookie cutter shooters. Stays true to the original triology formula and nails the new stuff
DonZeb,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"I cannot give this game a 10/10 like I expected. The campaign is a solid 8.5/10. It has amazing level and enemies design, but the open world, although fun, is a little boring to traverse. The grapleshot is a fun tool to use, but I expected vehicles to be the best option for travelling.

The multiplayer is the best of any shooter from the past decade. It's fun and I just can't stop playing it. What frustrates me is that 343i has done the impossible; they made a perfect multiplayer gameplaywise but botched the basics, being it playlists, progression and Battle Pass. The customization is really good, but way too grindy.

Still, it's an amazing game and the best shooter since the DOOM reboot duology. DOOM Eternal has a better campaign than Halo Infinite, but Infinite's multiplayer is head and shoulders above any other FPS still being played. Not a perfect game, but an amazing one. I would rate it some 87/10, but since I can't, it's a fair 9/10 for me."

Es todo lo que esperaba, un halo maravilloso y muy disfrutable que no puedo dejar de jugar."

The game is fun, and now with the open world there’s much you can do, except when you’re on missions at interiors, other than that the game is amazing, fun and addicting! 9.5 in my personal honest opinion. Ignore the 0’s they are Play Station Fans."

Deathbyrope,"Dec 10, 2021",0,"I wanted to like this game. I really did, but the short 6 hour DLC campaign was weak and the graphics were severely watch dogged from how they were shown off last year and the multilayer is still broken. The xp is trash, the marketplace is super expensive and they locked eveything behind it. Xbox is being money hungry for sure."
BillyRSea,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"I'm a long time fan of Halo since CE and Halo infinite is definitely the greatest Halo has ever been, 343i did an amazing job with this game from the unbeatable gunplay to the deep and touching story and beautifully crafted open world, topped off with a fantastic multiplayer better than any game that's out now

Halo CE felt like they wanted to make more of an open world game especially with missions like the silent cartographer but they were limited by the hardware at the time. Halo infinite feels like what Halo has always aspired to be I want to thank 343i for all the love and hard work they put into this game because after everything, they did it, they brought Halo back and better than ever before, saying I'm impressed would be a great understatement"

SpaceKiddo,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"-Halo infinte has one of the best multiplayer games this year (I usually play COD,Overwatch,Splatoon 2), I had so much fun and still have even after playing 30 hours of multiplayer.
-still they need to fix the leveling form, add more maps, and make 6 vs 6 maps, the way they did the samurai event is stupid but hopefully they will fix it.
-About the campaign I spent 6 hours and still interested in the story looks so polished and perfect till now, changing halo to kind of open world was a good choice  from the 343 and they prefected it.
-Music is just the best, and I love how the style of the game is still the Halo we know, modernized but still have that Halo style."

It lets you experience the story at your own pace while also experiencing other elements of the Halo universe. Multiplayer is loads of fun as well. Devs stayed true to the feel of other Halo games and didn't fall pray to popular battle royale pressures. Battlepass progression was pretty slow, but devs quickly fixed progression after hearing community feedback.performance in the open world is a bit rough, with frame rates on a 3080 and 109000K reach up to 25/30 ok ultra. Optimization should help."

Hamburglur,"Dec 10, 2021",1,"This entry into the series offers less content than nearly every other installment in the franchise. There’s no co-op mode, there’s no forge mode, there’s no playlist selection, you can’t replay missions without starting an entirely new campaign, the open world feels empty and tacked on, and half of the weapons feel like after thoughts when it comes to power and utility. The graphics don’t look next gen aside from a couple isolated areas or water effects. Sure the sound design is good and some of the gadgets are fun to use, but unfortunately there’s more to making an entertaining game than that."

Reclaimer343,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"A True return of form that can be compared to god of wars re-imagining, Just like god of war Halo has returned in a massive way that has managed to captivate the minds and hearts of a oid and new generation. In a sea of terrible games and the gaming industry itself crumbling Master chief stands tall again to fill the gaming community with HOPE much like John 117 in CE destroying that ring giving humanity hope once again (Halo ring being the industry as a whole). I can say with the upmost confidence I have grown up apart of halo from the first game i ever played on Christmas the year 2002 sitting in awe of the world Bungie had created, Fast forward 20 years later there i am a fully grown man with a tear in his eye sitting in awe of the world 343i has created. From the heart ache that once was halo 4/5 halo infinite feels like a true successor or even more than halo 3. This halo truly stands amongst the great halo games and i have no doubt in my mind with Joe staten at the helm this halo will be the greatest ever created. The engrossing story has you gripped from start to finish feeling like a true reclaimer once again as you fight the banished back the greatest foe master chief has ever faced and boy does it feel like utter hopelessness for the first time ever master chief feels like hes fighting an unstoppable foe that could be turned on its head at any moment. The multiplayer is a true return to form, 343i has reverted back to the golden triangle and just like halo 3 has carefully implemented equipment back onto the roster, It truly feels as if halo reach should have been the way halo infinite multiplayer is, Although the progression system has much to be desired and the store isnt as player friendly as youd expect from a halo game but the core elements of what makes a halo multiplayer fun is all there and then some, for me if its only the progression and store that needs serious work but the gameplay is as true to halo bungie as youre ever gonna get in 2021 where games are broken and the store is the only functional aspect then we're off to a game of the year contender, even if this halo was released back in the (golden age of xbox) it would still be an instant classic.

My final thoughts: 343i has made the greatest novel expression of a halo game i have ever got the honour to play, the multiplayer is a true return to form just like the story. Although progression and store front needs to be addressed asap. Overall what makes halo great is a gripping story that has all the heart and passion you want poured into it coupled with an instant classic multiplayer just like halo 1 through 3 then you have what is called a GREAT HALO GAME and that folks is what we have. 10/10 best halo to date."
Xxerg,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Es un muy buen juego con mecanicas muy divertidas sobretodo la del gancho y con una historia muy buena
iSaleSingles,"Dec 10, 2021",8,"I bought it Halo Infinite even though I have Gamepass.. Thats because the game is that good, I had to have it in my collection. It's getting great critic reviews from professionals, I'm loving the gameplay and the story, but somehow I feel it's still going to be a failure regardless. when it comes to a toxic community coming from some Sony fans not all, and being that negativity sale's on the internet, some Halo content creators  will nitpick this thing to death just for views. It doesn't matter how much a Dev Team is communicating with its community or if the road map is 1,000% flawless.. when the internet has it out for you it's going to get you no matter what you do! So for whoever reads this just pick the game up and buy it or download it from Game pass it's your choice.. it's a good game, it's a great game and it has a long life of content ahead of it.. just don't pay attention to these toxic trolls out here, it's all about how the game makes you feel."

SaulC,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"It’s been more than 20 years since Master Chief — and Halo: Combat Evolved — debuted. In that time, the Halo series has become one of video games’ most iconic legacies, while Master Chief has become the symbol of Xbox — and console-based first-person shooters — as a whole. It’s a legacy that developer 343 Industries has struggled to carry since taking over from Bungie, releasing two new games that felt like something of a decline from the series’ previous brilliance. Halo Infinite is intended to be a course correction, described by 343 as a “spiritual reboot” of the franchise, that not only reexamines what makes something feel like Halo, but also finds ways to push those qualities further.


The new direction has paid off. For the first time in years, it feels like 343 knows where Halo is going.

Halo Infinite somehow feels entirely like Halo and entirely not, transplanting the franchise’s traditional linear narrative and mission structure into a semi-open world. It preserves the intensity of the series’ combat while also finding the magic in the act of exploration. Halo Infinite is carrying a heavy legacy on its shoulders, and it’s doing so with confidence."
PetrovGamer,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Halo вернулась!
Это очень олдскульная игра во всех смыслах.
Открытый мир прост до безобразия, но разве это плохо?
Если в just cause и far cry, я хотел блевать от скучного и не интересного мира, то здесь засчет ахуенного геймплея, хочется играть снова и снова.Ситуация повторяется, также как и с shadow war, когда надо было гриндить, чтобы открыть секретную концовку, но так как в игры было офигенно играть, то здесь засчет ураганного геймплея, который прикреплен велеколепной стрельбой и классной атмосферой изучения Ореола из-за чего хочется изучать этот мир.Этот красивый живописный мир с красивыми пейзажами и динамичной  музыкой.Про мультиплеер скажу только, что он почти идеален, нужно только исправить систему прогрессии, благо разработчики уже этим занимаются."
VossiApollo13,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"So I've put many hours into the Multi-player and a couple hours into the Campaign. Multi-player wise the gameplay is perfect and feels nice and rewarding. They definitely went to the fundamentals of Halo of teamwork, strategy, and all round fun. The only issue is the store is pretty pricey and at the moment don't have Forge or Coop for a month or two. Campaign wise, it's definitely a mix of Halo CE and Halo 2 with how it feels. Story is solid and intriguing with plenty if classic Halo plot twists along the way. The story moves from linear to an open world within two missions. I was skeptical of having Halo be an open world but how 343 implemented it in this Halo is absolutely amazing. They truly immerse you and make you feel like you are master chief. The graphics are absolutely amazing with this new engine. Unfortunately the game isn't optimized perfectly for PC yet and doesn't have ray tracing until Forge comes out. But I ran it with a 3080ti and it's some of the best graphics I've seen from a developer l. Even without raytracing you can see shadows and reflections everywhere as if it's real life. Master Cheifs visor accurately reflects what's in front of it. And forerunner architecture looks absolutely beautiful. The open world looks amazing and can render out trees from other sides of the map with perfect detail is just astonishing"
JDKam27,"Dec 10, 2021",8,By far the best thing 343 has done with Halo. It looks great and the sandbox gameplay is so much fun. The only things holding it back from being a perfect 10 is a lack of multiplayer content and the insane crashing. I've never seen anything like it.  I'm trying to play through on legendary and It's been crashing about every 30-45 minutes on me. SO frustrating. I'm sick of the new game development model of releasing the game and finish development over the next 2 years. I have no doubt it will be a 10 in 2 years but I'll be long over it by then.
MisterChief,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"It's by far the best Halo since Halo 3 and the best on both campaign and multiplayer, solid gameplay and beautiful world to explore, I have some issues but not really with the battlepass but more so the lack of content at launch but still what I have here is very satisfying and I can see myself playing this game for a very long time to come, already have over 60 hours and counting, I do not believe I put that many hours into Halo 5 in 6 years lol and I've already done it with Infinite in a few weeks, as of right now the game is a solid 8/10, when all content is added over time it will be an easy 10/10 but since there are a lot of trolls here fanboys of a certain other platform review bombing it giving it 0s I will give the game a 10/10 to balance things out, Metacritic needs to require people sign in with their XBL/PSN/Steam etc accounts to review games to avoid the issue of review bombings by fanboys."
Peralt,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"O jogo te faz retornar para a Trilogia clássica, Halo infinite é o resgate de tudo aquilo que os fãs pediram, Master Chief mais Durão e sarcástico, uma nova IA bem carismática, e claro um Halo uma instalação forerunner.

A jogabilidade está incrível e com a adição do gancho explorar de maneira vertical não é mais um problema, o multiplay segue a mesma qualidade, além de ser free to play"

JonaCritic34,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"El renacimiento que la franquicia necesitaba, aunque quedaron mas dudas que respuestas, se supone que vienen muchos dlc's mas para cubrir eso, fuera de ello, el gameplay, el mundo y los sentimientos que la campaña despierta en ti son 20/10️"
Xr3Games,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Halo infinite resgata as raízes da franquia, assinalando para um futuro promissor. O game conta uma história consistente dando prosseguimento ao eventos de Halo 5, apesar de não ser complexa. O jogo não é perfeito, mas diante do que foi apresentado e levando em consideração o conturbado processo de produção adicionado a isso o contexto da pandemia, a 343i conseguiu entrega algo muito divertido para os fãs e novatos da franquia."
Dreamchest,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Un halo realmente excelente, seguí la historia de halo desde el Xbox clásico, en halo 5 me perdió un poco, pero con halo infinite me atrapo por completo que gran gameplay, gran historia, gráficos y un increíble multijugador estoy muy feliz por esto."
SkunkApe28,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"This is, hands down, the best halo game I have ever experienced. 343 outdid themselves while simultaneously redeeming themselves. The open world aspect to a halo game is what’s been missing to make this series a best of all time. What’s that? You’re not into open world games? Then follow the main story line to get that iconic halo feel. People rating this game below a 6, while have rights to their own opinions, need to be verified for validity. If you are a Halo fan you will not be disappointed. If you’re new to the franchise you should not be disappointed. If you’re a Sony fanboy… I understand your disappointment. Xbox has finally emerged from the catacombs to provide gamers with top tier experiences. Anyone that is a true fan of good shooters should try this game. If you have game pass it’s free! Almost no reason not to try it. The free to play multiplayer is a blast. While the micro transactions ****, you don’t have to buy them to have fun stacking up multi kills. Overall, this is the Halo I have been waiting/wanting to play since 2007"

Gamersunion,"Dec 10, 2021",0,"Halo infinite is more of the same old Halo.  That is not a necessarily bad thing but after 5 years and 500 million dollars you would expect to see a flawless, longer game.  The campaign only takes about 6-7 hours to complete and I recommend that you avoid the physical copy of this game because the disc does not come with a full version of the game.  Graphics are not next gen so if you were expecting a monster in that department you will be disappointed.  Sadly 343i keeps showing how incompetent they are by releasing half baked game after years of development.  You can tell all their focus went to the free multiplayer component of this game.  Xbox fans deserved better and it's sad to see that now that this game has move to the battle pass format we will never get a true  next gen Halo experience.

Just download the free multiplayer stay away from microtransactions and watch the story summary of the campaign  in YouTube."
benatan,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"En un videojuego debe primar la jugabilidad por encima de todo y este Halo sin que esto signifique que los demas apartados no sean excelentes, logra divertir a mas no poder, pocos juegos logran que unos se divierta una y otra vez sin llegar a cansar, este lo hace por partida doble, no solo su campaña es maravillosa , sino que tambien el multiplayer es igual de adictivo o incluso mas
Mencion a parte los efectos sonoros y su banda sonora, que sera recordada por mucho tiempo, por favor que los demas desarrolladores aprendan de 343 industries, si van a sacar un juego a medias, retrasenlo y escuchen a los usuarios"
Nigthwolf,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Simplemente hermoso, es el mejor halo de la franquicia.

Roy-133,"Dec 10, 2021",5,"It's the game, the game what Halo needs. It's very funny, the story is great and the gameplay fun and very clean."
MelissaBond007,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"The game is amazing, it feels like a classic halo, yes, I miss some of the classic guns, but apart from that, everything feels amazing, the story line is beautiful and it keeps you focused on the game. It's an epic game for sure."
daniel_cartwell,"Dec 10, 2021",9,Halo Infinite is the most fun I've had in a FPS since Doom eternal. The combat loop is addictive and the traversal is fun and fluid. The next chapter in the story can't come soon enough. I gave it a 9 for the campaign alone. When you factor in the multi player it's probably a 10.
JohnSnow117,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Absolutely the best game to release in the last 10+ years.  Everything is perfect. 343i had to try and make a game that is viable in 2021 but also makes the long standing fanbase happy.  AND THEY NAILED IT!

TheEnd1001,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"siento que lo que hicieron con el juego es realmente impresionante, la saga ha tomado un nuevo aire innovando en mecánicas que nunca creí que vería en un gameplay de Halo, a pesar del fiasco que resultó Halo 5 este ha creado momentos muy memorables, agradezco mucho todo lo realizado"
BungieFanboy,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Let's make a few things clear. My name is exactly what kind of ""Halo fan"" I am. I like Halo CE and Halo 2. Wasn't big on Halo 3, honestly only cared for Halo Reach's mediocre story, hated Halo 4's story, especially hated the multiplayer. Hated Halo 5's story, if the multiplayer wasn't named Halo, it would have actually been 'good'.
But that's where Halo Infinite stands.

Halo Infinite is a return to Halo CE and Halo 2, with ideas from Halo 3, Reach, 4 and 5 all mixed in.
Before reviewing Halo Infinite, let's take a look at what exactly I disliked about Halo 3:
Halo 3 had floaty, slower and boated movement, making strafing less viable and making every weapon feel like it was worthless. It's sandbox revolved around weakening every weapon so that the primary weapon (the Battle Rifle) would shine, but in doing so, also made the Battle Rifle far less accurate since it included RNG per each of the 3 bullets. MLG compensated by increasing to 110% damage, but I'll promptly state that this damage had been done. By 2009, Halo 3 was dead. ""Casual"" Halo was all what was **** Halo isn't a ""casual"" **** Competitive FPS game really is.

Halo Infinite, at it's core, is a return to form of CE and 2, where the focus is around balance,  weapon sandbox, and the power ups, now returned into equipment items, play a far more balanced, and dare I argue, skillful role within this sandbox. Long gone are the days where you're one-shot so you drop a bubble shield, pop a hardlight shield, jetpack away or spartan-charge and-shot your enemy. Now you, the player, have to actually make a proper decision or you'll be punished if the other player is better. A ""return to form"" of Halo CE's unintentional Multiplayer and Halo 2's formulated multiplayer experience.

For the campaign, this ones tricky since I haven't completed it yet. ""Why are you reviewing and giving it a 10 if you haven't completed it"". I've put in 18 hours of just exploration, slaying AI enemies, and random occurrence that I would have done literally within Zelda Breath of The Wild.
Let's just think about that for a moment. A Halo game, a title which the campaign has INFAMOUSLY been a copy-paste from CE for the last 20 years, feels closer to Zelda Breath of The Wild WHILST STILL being Halo. It's not an RPG, it's an action FPS title, yet it gives me the sense of adventure, whilst having missions, goals, and you even progress through the story without even realizing there is a story element to the exploration.

So let's just take a moment and think. Halo Infinite is a spiritual reboot, and by all means, this is taking this archaic outdated formula, and making it enjoyable to actually play for a 35 year old adult. That is why this receives a 10 out of 10. That is why everyone who gave it below a 7 isn't actually playing this game, they're simply obsessed over a cheap $500 plastic box, and are angry that their ""opponents"" plastic box received a video game that was good. As an adult PC Gamer who owns both a PS5 and Xbox Series S & X, this is literally why ""fanboys"" are idiots.

Which leads to the second crowd 'review bombing' the negative reviews. They aren't ""Bungie fanboys"" doing it, they're people who pretend to be ""Halo fans"" who don't even like Halo, and want to see it die. Most view the only Halo game they played, Halo 3, as the 'best' Halo...because they were a toddler playing it while their parents & older siblings were playing Call of Duty. So let's just be very clear here. If you're underneath 30 and pretend you ""only like Bungie Halo games"", there's only one reason why you do.
For quick context; Halo CE was vastly different than Halo 2, which was vastly different than Halo 3, which was vastly different from Halo 3 ODST, and also leagues different than Halo Reach. Each of these games are a level of variance in difference to where Halo 3 verses Halo 5 was.
And Halo Infinite returns itself back to it's original roots, whilst adapting the best changes of each of those Halo titles, and keeping the core premise of ""What is Halo"".
Which we all know is the unique, fun, and crazy physics engine, sandbox, and the unlimited ways you can approach encounters...both in campaign and multiplayer.

And finally, this game has a low skill floor, but not absurdly low. But the ceiling in this title is high, and clearly it can be even higher, provided they introduce new weapons that are even harder to use as the game goes on.

Halo Infinite Multiplayer is a 10/10.
Halo Infinite Campaign is a 10/10.
Halo Infinite was voted as the User Choice Game of The Year award for a reason. Get over it."
OmniRevan,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"A return to form. The opening hours feels just like classic Halo, and once Zeta Halo opens up it feels just like how Halo CE felt. The music and sound are beyond fantastic, a mix between familiar tracks with new ones go great together. Hearing the Banished communicate between themselves and when in combat is hilarious."
Clyptor,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"This game is a lot of fun great campaign really fun multiplayer and a really good foundation for a live as a service game .

There currently is a lag on of forge and campaign co-op, but if you remember the lanch of sea of thieves and look at it's current state I am confident that this could become the best halo ever.
Currently it's the best halo from 343 industry and I can recommend it. ( it also is in gamepass)"
Menezes9748,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Acabo de terminar la campaña, ha sido tan refrescante, este es el primer juego del que me atreví hacerle una review en Metacritic, es algo hermoso tanto el gameplay como el entorno y la historia, (además de que no quiero que los sonylievers haters le saquen 0 nomas porque les arde esta obra maestra ^^)"

Rich27,"Dec 10, 2021",10,This game is a solid step coming from halo 5 and is very repayable. The story was solid and the gameplay is the best in the franchise. Cant wait to see how 343 continues the story from here.

BigPPreview,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"I've been neck deep in the multiplayer for about a month and it's incredibly fun. Back to the fun of the 360 generation, when games just felt different.  The story is compelling so far, and the characters are among the best the series has had. The campaign feels like a natural extension of the classic titles, and not forced into a trendy open-world gametype that could easily be mismatched. Graphics look great! Don't believe the Sony fanboy narratives. It has some small details that look a little funky, but the overall image and characters all look great. Problems: •The progression in it's current state is marginally better than when it started. But it is actively being worked on and will eventually be satisfactory. •Playlists are currently a little lack-luster, but this will also be remedied in time.
•Co-op will be missing for a few months. This will be sorely missed until it's available. •Forge is not here yet. Some communities exist off this so it's no small thing. Overall with lacking content I'd give this a 8-9, but long-term this is a 10. There's no way I'm coming back to update this review, so I'm leaving it at the long-term score."
rickrod,"Dec 10, 2021",8,While it's not perfect it does retain the same feel as other Halo Campaigns have had even though it is a open world game. Can't wait for co-op to see what kind of shenanigans me and my family/friends can get into. Multiplayer side of the game can use some work done to it but nonetheless me and my family/ still have a fun time playing BTB mode.
Emitor,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Muy buen videojuego,un gran regreso de 343 industries, definitivamente no todos van a comprender lo que en verdad significa , algunos creen que agregaron muchas cosas nuevas que llevan desde el halo 5 o que quitaron otras ,la verdad es que es la definición perfecta de como llevar una saga íconica a seguir manteniendo un estilo clásico y a su vez renovarse como nunca ,una verdadera secuela que pone en alto el nombre de halo, el rey de los fps"
PBoasey,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Its a good story that takes me back to the Bungie era, with a pinch of Halo 4 story telling, that also doesn't forget about all that happened in Halo 5. I was very satisfied with the Campaign other than it's lack of environmental variation, but this will most likely not be the only campaign we see in this game. The game play is amazing, the best the series has seen. MP has its monetisation and customisation problems, which can be fixed with time, but is overall a really fun and satisfying experience. I truly believe when all the issues are fixed and missing features are added the game will be near perfect and the definitive, modern Halo experience.
Artstyle: 9
Story: 9 (considering what it had to finalise from halo 5 aswell as it's new story)
Storytelling/characters: 9
Gameplay: 10
Multiplayer: 9 (as of now)"
PacoGamer,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"La verdad yo le daría un 8 o un nueve por los problemas que tiene el multijugador(microtransacciones, pocos modos de juegos, algún que otro bug etc.), pero la campaña lo he disfrutado muchísimo además de que me veo en la obligación de ponerle un 10 debido a la cantidad absurda de bajas calificaciones que los fanboys de PS le están poniendo .-."
Amirhoseinasad,"Dec 10, 2021",10,Always Perfect. I love this game its so good  congratulations to 343i for making this game
Mildewyspace,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Of course a ton of salty people (Sony fanboys) are review bombing it because it’s actually a good game and they can’t help but be upset.

But anyways the game is SUPER fun. Campaign is a blast to do almost whatever you want when it comes to how you wanna tackle a mission. And the story is MUCH better than their last installment. As for the multiplayer don’t get me wrong super fun as well and I will be playing it for a very long time. But that doesn’t mean it is 10/10, the progression system is very slow and they don’t really give you much when it comes to armor if you did end up buying the battlepass, and as of right now there is no playlist settings, so no only slayer queuing."
BlueFireA25,"Dec 10, 2021",10,"Definitivamente Halo Infinite es un juego que vuelve a revitalizar a la franquicia de una manera impresionante y épica, devolviendo elementos clásicos que eran claves en el juego a su escancia mas pura y divertida combinándolos con nuevos elementos que se sienten frescos."

Bruh_112,"Dec 10, 2021",9,"The game is good, What more can I say. Although it's a little rough round edges(multiplayer not having dedicated playlists for modes and monetisation that is about predatory for halo standards). It's still amazing. The gameplay is crisp and fun and by the far the most polished compared to others (bf 2042 and vanguard). The campaign is the best it's been since reach. With a gripping story that is sometimes even a tear jerker. The master chief has never been better and the supporting cast and main antagonist is well written. Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anybody with a Xbox or PC. Oh ya, and the graphics although not as good as some other games, is incredibly stylized and that is way better"

There are still small problems in optimization, I know that there is no anti-cheat, but I have not met cheaters in 26 hours. Now I say sonyboys, listen, if there was a game on ps, you wouldn't cry and talk about the last of ass 2, which had all the reviews made by sonyboys bots"
soundbend3r,"Dec 10, 2021",10,I don’t know what more you could possibly want from a modern Halo release. Nearly perfect.
