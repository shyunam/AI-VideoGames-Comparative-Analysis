Mrfuzz117,"May 7, 2024",10,Genuinely one of my favorite games. It was one of the first games I 100%ed and I can't recommend it enough.
nh59bany,"Feb 15, 2024",8,"Nice short and uninhibited trip to Mordor. Its gameplay is low threshholdy, compact and smooth without getting dull during its story. Its implications for the lore of Middle Earth is interesting and the Nemesis-system quite the jamboree. 

Completionists also find their meat with tricky challenges, collectibles that are sometimes connected to interesting lore and references to nerdy book details and side missions that keep on being fresh during its 14-18hrs of playtime."
Ac_Steez,"Jan 27, 2024",7,"Un tres bon jeu, le scénario est sympa, mais les missions sont beaucoup trop répétitifs. Le gameplay est cool, très bon système de combat, beaux finishers. Le jeu n’est pas très beau pour un jeu de 2014 en revanche. Dommage qu’on ne puisse pas se balader librement dans la map en revanche, on se fait attaquer constamment."

Giann96,"Sep 20, 2023",4,Sin identidad en el gameplay y sandbox poco creativo.
PyroRaider,"Oct 21, 2023",8,"A clear ripoff of Arkane's Batman series, but a very fun ripoff. Combat is satisfying and the nemesis system is quite good, prompting other games to ripoff this mechanic. The story is whatever, the pacing can be extremely slow at times, and the combat can get a bit boring, but messing around with orcs in the open world and converting them to your army is very fun and unique. Might not keep your attention until the end, but still worth your time."
artorias95,"Oct 15, 2023",7,"Even though it may seem a bit repetitive its a pretty satisfying game, especially for LOTR fans. Recommended!"
Johnnylowfive,"Oct 11, 2023",10,ALMOST as good as the Arkham series and must play for LOTR fans and Arkham fans. Nemesis system is a lot of fun too

Killerpummkin,"Aug 9, 2023",9,"The game with very good graphics, the gameplay is very similar to Assassin's Creed in its best features, very interesting side quests, I do them simply because it is interesting to weaken the army of Sauron, the game is worth its money."
MeSalman,"Jun 29, 2023",8,"Game story if good, game-play and combat is nice but can be improved especially climbing walls. If you are a fan of AC then this is a game for you.

Elite_Soldier,"May 3, 2023",7,"SOM is a pretty good game! The nemesis system slaps. However, the graphics aren't the best, but this is compensated by the atmosphere.

- The story is a bit confusing, especially the ending and side missions get a lil repetitive by the end.
- Side characters and even the main character didn't stand out too much, but at least the Uruk's performances were captivating!"
gamer664,"Apr 23, 2023",0,What is the point of stealth when enemies instantly respawn after you walked only 10 feet away lol. Terrible game design.
brockcheese,"Apr 23, 2023",8,This game is an assassin's creed clone but in the world of lord of the rings that is much appreciated.
lxsthighway,"Apr 15, 2023",5,"why the **** is this an Arkham clone. I will never understand the obsession with this kind of mindless button mashing combat, its good for Arkham because it makes you ""fight like batman"". why the **** is someone in a ****ing lord of the rings game fighting like this, and the detective vision is so ****ing out of place."
ruroniHS,"Mar 31, 2023",6,"This game is not worth the title game of the year. It's not a bad game by any means, but it's just a typical open-world romp with a LotR coat of paint. The combat is fun, but shallow, and has a very low skill ceiling. Two of the three boss encounters were extremely disappointing and the story has some issues, but you can still have fun with this game."
foraday,"Mar 28, 2023",7,"Shadow of Mordor holds up well by modern standards with intuitive controls and consistently-paced gameplay. The stealth mechanics feel well-integrated and unforced. Instead of feature bloating like many modern games it finds what works and sticks to it. (+1) It does suffer somewhat being a product of its time graphically. The style isn’t particularly distinct and the environment can be bland and monotonous. (0) Where other medias of LotR failing to interest me, I did find learning the lore and background of these characters to be interesting, though the main character is somewhat 2-dimensional (this could be intentional give the overall theme of the game). (+1) The music brought fourth the visceral and brutal nature of the gameplay and story, with voice performances that were serviceable. Being an early PS4 game it has to rely on the controller sound which could become repetitive but was overall one of the better uses of it during combat. (0) An easy game to trophy hunt and the collectibles aren’t gratingly long, but I don’t think there is much reason to return to this title after one finishes the story. (-1) It was refreshing to play a game where things weren’t breaking or crashing constantly. Easy win for this game to create a simple and stable game. (+1)

Overall, while not pushing the envelope and borrowing from some established franchises, the Nemesis System made for a unique experience in both difficulty and gameplay, but seems like it could be expanded upon. (0)"
CoreGamer1408,"Mar 12, 2023",8,"Long time fan of the books/movies and that kind of doesn't help. The land or Mordor and it's inhabitants aren't really anything new or fresh. As for this type of open world & combat I am kind of burnt out on that style ( after four Arkham games and one Mad Max game ). The story elements are not enough to pull me in alone. The much praised Nemesis system I really am not bothered ether way. The umpteenth enemy shouting a variant of ""Come on if you think you are hard enough"" reminded me of comical wrestlers talking smack down nonsense.  If I was new to the IP and this style of gameplay then yeah it would be maybe a 8/10 or something. Graphics don't hold up and this game is one of the weaker looking games on the PS4."
GRX3m0m,"Mar 8, 2023",0,"How can you not add an invert X axis on a 2014 game? While not the majority, the number of gamers who can't play without it is still huge. Fastest 0 rating for a AAA game in my life."
FangRu,"Feb 6, 2023",9,Okayy. If you like LotR like me than you will definitely love this game! Super ranger stranded  and slaying orcs in Mordor? Sign me in! Graphics for its time are good. Story is great. And gameplay is fantastic. And most importantly the game is very immersive. Nemesis system is revolutionary and adds so much fun to this game... 9/10
Jollyolfun,"Nov 18, 2022",7,"to put it eloquently, this game is fun assassins creed. not much more to say about that."

DanielGG91,"Nov 15, 2022",8,Me encantó esta propuesta de reavivar los juegos AAA del lore de El Señor de los Anillos. Siempre esperaré un remake de los juegos de las películas con la calidad técnica de éste Sombras de Mordor. El sistema némesis fue una grata sorpresa.
helloicool,"Oct 24, 2022",0,"I hate to tell you, but this game just ****. I got so board I quit the game. It is nothing like the Batman games. Batman is a 10."
BrianDavid94,"Sep 8, 2022",8,"Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions.

(8) Very Good. Innovated, but perhaps not in the right choice for everyone. This score indicates that there are many good things to be had, but arguable so.

Probably the best LoTR game in regards to gameplay. Gameplay is fun and competitive with the Nemesis system that they built for it. Story isn’t bad either. My only negative is how small the map is and how the story even reuses the same location over and over again. I don’t like grindy/repetitive games so I eventually stopped playing. Even though I gave up, there is plenty of perks, upgrade, and Nemesis system to keep others interested. It's worth a try."

Wofw,"Aug 1, 2022",5,"[RU]
Не, ребят... Не рекомендую тратить на эту игру своё время. Да, у неё есть уникальная механика, но при этом у неё так же есть скучный сюжет, пустой опенворлд и никакущий мир. Возможно фанатам зайдёт, но я себя к ним не причисляю."
tadnid,"Jun 4, 2022",8,"Great game even today. Combat has similarities with the Arkham series as others mentioned, but it is generally more fluid and much easier to achieve higher streaks. I found the DLC to be weaker sometimes unbalanced, sometimes tedious. I finished the lord of the hunt, abandoned the bright lord midway, and ignored the trials challenge thing. Never used any skins. So, only try the DLC if they come for free. All in all spent around 40h."
SomeGamerRequal,"May 23, 2022",8,"plot of the game takes place between The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. Talion's family is responsible for guarding Black Gate, Talion is killed by Sauron's servants, but just before his death, Talion's body is taken over by an elven wraith with whom, after reaching an agreement, they plan revenge."
TediPik91,"Jan 24, 2022",9,"An extremely good game, bought it for $5, but I would easily get it for $50.  Gameplay and combat are good. Story is so-so. The nemesis system is a nice addition to the game. That's how you create a game."
Cyrus666,"Dec 22, 2021",6,"Number of playthroughs: 2
Totaly hours played: 40 hours
If I'm being honest, due to the high praises and the awards won, I thought I was going to have the time of my life. But my feelings changed after a few hours.
This game has mechanics similar to Batman Arkham Series. Combat and stealth are mixed together into  the gameplay. I can say that Shadow of Mordor has the exact combat as Arkham series. You have regular strikes, you can counter before a strike using the triangle button, there are finisher moves that aren't exactly like the Arkham series but they are assigned to the buttons similar to Arkham.
The only difference between these 2 games is that in Shadow of Mordor you kill enemies and in the Arkham series you don't.
The game is fun for 4-5 hours but after that, it's a boring repetitive game. Everyone praises the Nemesis system for how fun and intriguing it is but I personally didn't feel like it made much of a difference.
During the first few hours, you try to learn about every target's weakness and plan ahead but after those starting hours you have to massacre so many Uruk bosses that you don't get info on them and just dive into their territory. I personally found that most bosses were weak to finisher damage so I didn't bother planning ahead.
Each game has a gameplay loop where you do the same things over and over and over again. That gameplay loop has to be fun in order for the game to succeed and for this game, the gameplay loop became extremely repetitive after a while. I always felt like I was playing an inferior version of Arkham games.
Whereas in Arkham Knight you have the Batmobile and the flying mechanic that always remain fun means of traversal throughout the game or in Witcher 3 where you always have Roach by your side, in this game you must run to the points of interest and use fast travel. You do get the ability to quickly make steeds out of the animals around the map but as soon as you get off of them they just run away to attack enemies. So the traversal is not as fun as the Arkham series or Witcher 3.
The maps are also small and the first map is boring and uninspiring.
The game wasn't all bad. Here are some positive aspects of it:
You feel more and more empowered as you progress through the game and unlock new abilities which I personally think is extremely important in such games.
The second map you unlock is beautiful
The murdering of uruks is fun (not all the way through the game tho)
Overall I give this game a 6 out of 10. It had the potential to be good but ends up being boring and repetitive."

Chempion1,"Nov 18, 2021",8,"Решил написать про Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Честно говоря не ожидал такого от Monolith.
Короче говоря разработчик создал свой Assassin’s Creed в Средиземье. И он у него, как мне кажется, получился.
Мне очень понравился сюжет, он самобытный и никакого отношения к книгам Толкина не имеет. Но как не странно, он очень хорошо вплетен в канву произведения и я думаю со временем станет каноном. Сюжет цельный, имеет завязку, кульминацию и развязку.
Выглядит игра превосходно. Я пробовал её и на XBox360, так вот там играть нельзя, запрещено категорически! Мир разнообразен, хорошо прорисован. Все орки выглядят по разному, а их на минуточку тысячи! Не плохой стелс, не плохой паркур, боёвка взята прямиком из Batman: Arkham Asylum. Карта местности.....да короче это как я уже писал Assassin’s Creed Unity в Средиземье.
В игре не плохие боссы, каждый со своим подходом. Даже рядовые ""капитаны"" орочьей армии имеют свои сильные и слабые места.
Так же мне очень понравилась прокачка, она не замутнённая и доходчивая.
Но самое главное это атмосфера самой игры, она очень подходит самому произведению.
Конечно есть и недостатки. Например эти пафосные диалоги капитанов которые нельзя пропустить или отменить. По началу это забавляет, но по мере прохождения, когда этих капитанов становится как грибов, начинает бесить. Так, к примеру, ты сражаешся и уже набрал высокий множитель, как вдруг появляется какой то капитан (хорошо если один), бой приостанавливается, он начинает вещать всякую хрень и всё, множитель слетел, ты потерялся в бою, хорошо если не убили.
Так же в игре какое то чумовое автонавидение как в паркуре, так и в бою. Иногда Талион тварит какое то непотребство, прыгает не туда куда надо и атакует сам по себе кого хочет.
Конечно мне не хватало русской озвучки, пафосных речей в игре очень много.
Всё это мелочи, но они иногда просто начинают бесить.
К сожалению в сиквеле всё это только усугубилось.
Короче играть на PlayStation 4 мне очень понравилось. Жаль только, что в Shadow of War всё хорошее, что было в оригинале спустили в унитаз ради заработка на лутбоксах. И хотя через год их отменили, положения это не исправило. Сиквел остался с дырявым сюжетом, да ещё умудрился пойти в разрез с книгами Толкина."

Plus the climbing feels awful just like the movement weekend I have never felt like my character is moving through water and all of my movements are delayed it's horrible. But thes mechanic makes it's all  Worth playing it once . I just got it Platinum  trophy  so this is the last time I will  play the game it was fun while it lasted but getting a
Platinum trophy was boring"
kylocosplay,"Jun 5, 2021",8,"El gameplay me ha parecido muy bueno, el poder enfrentarte a hordas de orcos variando de combos y habilidades hace que siempre sea distinto cada combate. Tiene una gran rama de habilidades y mejorar todas las armas del personaje. La historia se ambienta entre el Hobbit y el señor de los anillos, algo bueno ya que cuentan cosas del canon sobre ese lugar. El sigilo es muy bueno y el sistema de némesis es algo original y único."

The industry is built on innovating existing ideas. Everything is inspired by something that came before it. That's how games, art, music, writing, culture itself and everything else works. Patenting the nemesis system is like patenting a color blue, or like patenting an the idea of a powerful corrupting item in storytelling. WB Games needs to back down on this."

aspentitan,"Jan 29, 2021",9,"It's very puzzling to see anyone hate on this game. All the tools you need for open world gameplay are here. Like stealth? Game has stealth Exp rewards. Like combat/action? Game has weapon upgrades. Like open world? This game isn't linear by any means. Like RPGs? You can choose your characters strengths and essentially strategy. Like value in a game and replayability? The nemesis system will make each game with differences for each playthrough. Personally I love this game with so much to do and your own choices on how to tackle the game. And on top of that no software bugs. The criticism I've heard from the game is it's a repetitive button masher but I'm not buying that it's these same players who aren't grasping the open world concept and try to play the game without experimentation thus limiting their own enjoyment. I guess there will always be players utilizing only two buttons when there are more options but let's not forget how perfect a game this is, it also allows for people to play the game with two buttons if that is their gaming skill capacity."
piuscorvus,"Jan 2, 2021",6,"For some, this game can be pretty frustrating. It certainly was for me as I quit it two times. However, whenever I felt that some game was too hard, that actually meant (in most of my cases) that I was playing it wrong. This game has a specific system and if you do not understand it and do not follow that code the game will feel abnormally hard. It took me a few hours to get how it actually works and then, the gameplay felt good. Still very challenging (difficulty setting does not exist) but good.

Shadow of Mordor felt something like a Tolkien-fan-fiction thing. You are a man of Gondor who is on his quest of revenge in the land of Mordor and the story is far below average, which degrades this game and leaves you only with a good, challenging gameplay, which I would describe as a mixture of Batman Arkham series (but harder) and Assassin's Creed (moving and jumping around).

The gameplay is based on finding information, locating and defeating Orcs and finally, dominating their armies. You first start with lower ranks and slowly go up to the Warchiefs, the strongest Orcs. Every Orc has its own strengths and vulnerabilities and that is what makes this gameplay not just another completely boring button masher. Even though you are doing the same things from the beginning to the end of the game (you are only fighting, you are in Mordor and surrounded by Orcs almost the whole time), I was never bored even after more than 20 hours of gameplay.

Shadow of Mordor is not a bad game but it is far from a great game. However, I see a big potential here and I think that at some point in the future we might see one great Middle-Earth game."

assassinader200,"Nov 19, 2020",9,"""Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor"", alias ""Sombras de Mordor "" es un videojuego ambientado en la tierra media y centrado en una ubicación legendaria como es la ""Puerta Negra"" y sus alrededores. Como ya he dicho la ambientación tiene como punto de partida el mundo de Tolkien pero los desarrolladores han conseguido una visión particular, única, con cierta libertad. Ya había habido juegos ambientados en la tierra media pero nunca con tanto realismo y calidad.
La calidad gráfica es muy buena para ser un juego de 2014. En general las texturas, el entorno y los enemigos están muy bien logrados. Por esto es que el juego hace hincapié en detallar a las huestes orcas, en especial en crear Capitanes Orco únicos unos de otros, con diferentes aspectos, tamaños, habilidades y voces. La inteligencia artificial entonces podemos decir que extremadamente buena, con un sistema nuevo, el llamado ""Sistema Némesis"", el cual da ""memoria"" a los enemigos y de esta identidad personal. Así, por ejemplo, si no logramos derrotar a un enemigo orco anónimo este se convertirá en Capitán y nos recordará en un futuro enfrentamiento nuestra patética muerte, se burlará de nosotros. La IA también desempeña otras funciones, pueden realizar emboscadas, pueden ""desafiar a la muerte"" o resucitar de una supuesta muerte.
La historia es otro punto fuerte de este juego. Controlamos a Talion, un montaraz y guardián de Mordor que tras el asesinato de su familia a manos de los orcos decide vengarse y dar caza a los secuaces de Sauron. Lo más curioso es que Talion también parece morir al principio del juego pero decide ""burlar a la muerte"" gracias al espíritu de un antiguo elfo poderoso, Celebrimbor, forjador de los anillos de poder. Así la aventura estará cargada de combates espectaculares contra orcos y otras bestias fantásticas y el objetivo de venganza estará presente casi toda la partida. Aún así la trama es más intrincada de lo que parece y cada jugador debería valorarla una vez concluida.
El combate como ya he dicho es espectacular, combinado con habilidades comprables que incrementan la fuerza del personaje para así realizar movimientos más rápidos o ejecuciones brutales, las cuales hacen saltar la negra sangre de los orcos. El espíritu de Celebrimbor nos brinda una velocidad y agilidad espectrales y un sistema de arco muy épico.
Sin duda se trata del mejor juego ambientado en la tierra media y un juego muy notable de la década pasada. Combate e historias fabulosas, una IA muy elaborada y un mundo detallado hacen de esta entrega uno de mis juegos favoritos."
Lord_Fall,"Nov 16, 2020",9,"Enjoyed every bit of this game, which builds on excellent LOTR lore and let you enjoy much more than you know about the saga, especially during the last fights. Will surely take the second, Shadow of War. Very well done"

Galix,"Oct 18, 2020",8,"Un juego muy disfrutable y muy similar a los assassin's creed tanto en lo bueno como en lo malo.

Lo bueno:
- Gameplay muy directo e intuitivo con mucha acción.
- El momento en el que se sitúa la historia llama la atención, pues no es algo en lo que se haya profundizado demasiado. Además las cinemáticas en las que podemos ver como Sauron engañó a Celebrimbor para forjar los anillos son una maravilla para cualquier fan del mundo de Tolkien.
- El juego cuenta con coleccionables y misiones secundarias para alargar el juego que siempre son de agradecer.

Lo malo:
- La forma de contar la historia es algo desordenada y no es la mejor del mundo.
- Se toman ciertas licencias con respecto a la historia de Celebrimbor, algo que no puedo aplaudir.
- Fallos típicos de los assassin's creed, como cuando quieres golpear a un enemigo pero golpea a otro, quieres correr pero se para en seco delante de una cajita, quieres trepar por un lado pero no lo hace, etc.
- Se puede volver algo repetitivo si lo quieres conseguir todo."
Arnitxe,"Sep 8, 2020",9,"Playing it in 2020 is not as good as it was 6 years ago when the game was released. I found some bugs during missions and some in walls glitches as well but this bugs didn’t ruin my experience at all. I started it Monday the 27th of July and finished it on Friday the 31st of July with a Platinum Trophy. It was fun, I reccomend you to play it. Smash some uruks ;)"

MurphyBrandon,"Aug 8, 2020",8,"Glad to be back in the Middle Earth universe killing Orcs and Uruk-Hai. Its fighting is combination of Batman games and early Assassin's Creed games with an extra touch of godlike abilities. It does get repetitive and tedious because the enemies re-spawn infinitely and you'll be revisiting the same areas multiple times, but it's not too bad. The characters are pretty forgettable beside the protagonist and the ethereal being inside of him. The nemesis system is an innovative idea that isn't fully realized until the second game: Shadow of War."
benjivm,"Jul 6, 2020",8,"Shadow of Mordor scratches the exact same itch that all the Arkham games do. The story is acceptable, voice acting is fine, and the plot itself is mostly sound. For these kinds of games, though, that doesn't really matter; play for the combat and mood, because that is where this game is strongest."
robotchipmunk,"Jul 4, 2020",5,"Honestly gameplay and the nemesis system are the only things this game has going for it. The story is poo poo. This game is really fun for the first few hours when you are still figuring out the combat, but by the end it feels like a souless grind."

Vaeu,"Jun 30, 2020",6,"Interesting at the start, but the gameplay gets repetitive and rather tedious as the game progresses. The graphics are average and the sound quality is expected. The characters aren't memorable and the story gets disappointing as the game progresses. A solid Middle-Earth sure, but nothing special."
Lord_Khey,"Jun 19, 2020",8,"This game could reasonably be called (and I say this with the highest of compliments) ""Batman: Assassin's Creed.""

It combines all the elements that made the Arkham series and the Ezio saga in AC and blends it into the world of J.R.R. Tolkien.  Of course, the game is 6 years old as I write this, so I'm late to the party and am almost certainly reporting nothing new.  It also represents an unfortunately dying era of actioners that have the standard difficulty level right where it should be, and where leveling up doing side quests actually gives you advantages when you finally go after boss-level opponents.
Leveling up might be a shade too quick, but better than the alternative.

The sound design is wonderful, and stands out by far over other technical aspects.  Using sound from your standard TV speakers AND the PS4 controller (weapons clashing, ethereal dreamlike voices, and even the announcement of the Uruk Captains  you identify with Detective ****...I mean...Eagle ****...darnit, I mean in Wraith World) really aids to immerse you in the game.

You may know Troy Baker on TV as ""The Mentalist,"" but he is a fine voice actor - not just in this game as Talion, but in general.  He is off-set perfectly by his long-dead counterpart Celebrimbor (an elf with a dwarven-sounding name, IMO) played by Alastair Duncan.  The sound team also did its best to vary the voices of the various captains and warchiefs, but you could start to separate which voice actor was which after awhile.  But what can you do when the enemies are literally infinite?

The graphics and animation are fine, but even though Mordor is a ruin, there wasn't a lot of imagination in level design.  The two maps you play (I'm not including the one-off ""Tower"" mission toward the finale) are featureless with a couple of walls here and a hill or two there, though the second map is slightly better.

The game mechanics are largely solid, with free flow combat right on par with the Arkham series (including the frustration of Talion not going at the right target in a large melee) and the climbing/assassinating mechanics that AC fans love (including the occasional ""Up! Up! Up!"" when you're **** at least trying to - I shouted that MANY times during this game).  Still, there's something satisfying about being in the middle of a melee, then Shadow Striking your way to a vantage point high above the action to rain arrows down.

Everyone else mentions the Nemesis system, so I will, too.  It's a clever mechanic where uruks who kill you get promoted to captain and can work their way up to warchief.  It sets up revenge matchups and power struggles that you can determine the outcome.  The real fun begins when you start to be able to dominate them (kind of like magical brainwashing) and make them your followers.

However, it can get under your skin a bit when you're battling one captain and his goons when ANOTHER captain shows up out of the blue with his **** then sometimes a third, or even a fourth.  That's a melee, but it's one you don't want because all these captains, while they have their weaknesses, have several more strengths and things they're immune to.

Several missions have a bonus objective, most of which are do-able on a first go (this is a POSITIVE thing, folks), but you have to pay attention.  Still, the game doesn't penalize you for missing it.  Just as well, because I don't think you can replay the missions in-game.

I started the Great Hunt DLC, but only got about 33% of the way through it.  I just wasn't into the missions.  I didn't start The Bright Master DLC, so I can't say anything about it."
SomethingSquid,"Jun 14, 2020",8,"Shadow of Mordor is like Assassins Creed with its best aspects more focused. This game is great. It’s a Lord of the Rings hack and slash adventure that is challenging at the beginning and fun. You can play the game in several ways, like using stealth or rushing into the strongholds and destroying everything. While Shadow of War was good, its writing and visuals aren’t nearly as good as its predecessor. The only big negative of this game I can think of is the final boss was very underwhelming. Overall this game was a joy to play and I can’t recommend it enough."

Graphics are excellent and atmospheric with a plausible story line. The only thing I disliked were the stealth missions - but I always hate stealth missions, they're boring as hell.

the missions are fun and interesting and diverse, the characters are somewhat charismatic, but you cant really connect to them as much. there's not enough time.

- Polished fighting system (as in Batman, but even better).
- Decent stealth (I'm looking at you, Assassin's Creed).
- Nemesis system actually produces cool moments with orc captains
- *spoiler* Gollum and Sauron have cameos

What I didn't like:
- All side quests are just stupid grinding. Felt like **** work.
- Final boss battles are QTE. Why? I wanted to actually fight them.
- It consists of even more than 50 shades of gray."

I’ve had many more memorable and unpredictable battles with its randomized Warchiefs and captains than I did in the scripted campaign missions, and I expect those to keep on coming."
Berik,"Feb 22, 2019",8,"So what if we take the Lord of the Rings, mix it with the Batman Arkham series and Assassins Creed? Apparently, a tasty drink called Shadow of Mordor!

The game uses the nemesis system to pit Orcs against you in hierarchy, but also uses it to make these Orcs more personal. If one kills you it gets promoted and remembers you. You'll form personal vendetta's with them as they get stronger, and even get to control your own! The most fun is definetely in hunting a targeted Orc and then clashing with him in an epic fight.

The story is pretty bland, though with a very daring and cool twist at the end. The protagonist is a wraith, which means he can't die. This serves the system of the game great, but he as a character is pretty average. This can also be said for other characters that are human as they are all rip-offs from the movies.

I picked this game up for 12 euros, and it was so much fun. I can recommend this game. I give it an 8/10."
Deanomite,"Jan 31, 2019",10,"An excellent game, very good sound effects and voice acting.  built on the same engine as Batman Arkham, group combat feels similar but terrifying because you cannot rappel away from a horde, just have to stick it out.  Combat was extremely enjoyable, slowing time for an elf arrow barrage a personal favorite, as well as the guys killing you getting promoted was a brilliant touch.  to boot, its cheap now."
maap20,"Jan 31, 2019",8,"I like the game, great graphics and the history  interesting, if you like the world of lord of the rings I recommend this game."
sufflaminandus,"Jan 21, 2019",5,"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is yet another collector simulator in the age of open-world action-adventure genre. Everything is straight from recipe list: seamless huge areas? Check. Piles and piles of building, rocks and landscapes to climb upon? Check. Infinite respawning foes roaming those places? Check. Garbage hidden in every inappropriate corner? Check. Unnecessary stories tethered to each piece of that garbage? Check. Generic unsolicited ‘side quests’? Check. Stealth? Check. Upgrades and abilities? Check. Progress tab to track percentage of your ‘completion’? Check. In fact, M-e:SoM is so discrete designed that even main quests are perceived as trite markers on map to add to your percentage. But, at least, developers are honest about the story: in a first thirty minutes we introduced to the objective that doesn’t change through all 20 hours, to kill a trio of evil fellows. Blant but ok. At least they are not pretentious.

So recall an any Assassin’s Creed, extract combat from Batman, throw it all in a alchemy pot and you will distill M-e:SoM. But, of course, there are some flavorings that makes the game distinguishable from others.

Visuals in general are eye-catching and pleasing but architecture is gray. There are no lore landmarks present, thus Mordor doesn’t inspire imagination. It’s like something completely separated from The Lord of the Rings.

Protagonist is half-human, half-ghost and this mix actually feels fresh. Contrast between good-natured ranger Talion and stern dour elf-ghost is entertaining, especially remarks of the latter (huge thanks to his brilliant voicing).

Combat is fifty-fifty. The melee part of it is bad. For a game where you can fight thirty orcs at a time, this fact is very disappointing. The system itself is exact copy of Batman’s but somehow in M-e:SoM it is bleak: basic attacks lack feedback and impact, enemies designed around lots of unrewarding dodging and parrying; so lots, in fact, that it’s quickly becomes a drudgery.

Archery and stealth, on the other hand, are superb and astounding. Stealth mechanic is trivial: press button-you will crouch-you will be less noticeable but, paired with decent AI, it is just what we need for such kind of game. Balance is perfect: there are no discoveries through walls but there are no ridiculous ‘hide-in-place-sight’ situations either. This makes stealth a go-to option, not due to rewards (like in a lot of other games) but because it’s actually fun.

Advantages of archery are indirect. The game uses environmental combat utilities (like explosive… bonfires, yes) and they are realized through archery exclusively. The miracle is that M-e:SoM is one of the maybe five games where *all* supporting objects are useful. Incredibly useful, I must add. The other excellence of archery is skill you can learn midgame: you aim your bow at *any* visible orc (yes, literally hundreds of meters away) and you will flash to him and silently end his miserable life. It doesn’t require much resources so generally you can freely use it most of the time. Must I advertise how awesomely cool this skill is? All that spiderweb flying and horse riding doesn’t stand even close to the breathtaking tactics you can realize with ghost bow.

And the last gem of the M-e:SoM is, of course, a nemesis system. In short: orcs live their own lives. The purpose of their lives is to climb career ladder: nameless rookie - captain - warchief. To obtain rank you need power and power is accumulated through numerous means: feasts, executions, duels, ambushes… And you can be a part of it all! Wanna promote your own warchief? Easy: save him from ambush, intervene in duel, help him slay the beast, or (what’s even more easier) let him kill yourself! Games features no manual saves, the are no game overs (you are immortal and will resurrect after death), defeat is irreversible, so any orc who manages to slay legendary wrath-ranger will surely get a promotion… and become your nemesis. The real show begins later in game when you will learn mind control. You will be able to subjugate a warchief and order him to wage war against another warchief, or brainwash captain-bodyguard and command him to betray his master (and if he succeeds in attempt he will become a warchief himself, yours warchief!). Intriguing, isn’t it? But pointless. The system is great itself but it offer zero reward. There is absolutely no reason to dabble with it more than you have to. Sandboxing is good… but no. Nevertheless, it’s makes M-e:SoM open world quite charming: everything is on the move, changing, captains comes and goes, rivalries resolved…

If you are a fan of marker-chase explore-on-your-own action-adventure games, M-e:SoM would be a solid choice for you, as it offers qualitative implementation of said mechanics, entertaining combat, pleasing graphics and unique nemesis system. Otherwise, pass by without second thoughts, we’ve seen it all before."

It was an action adventure with some elements of RPG.

Was it fun?

I can’t remember the last time I had this much fun playing a video game.

Are there any similar games?

From what I hear, its similar to assassin’s creed (only better). I have never played assassin’s creed so I don’t know.

Favorite Character?

I don’t really have a favorite. Although Ratbag is kind of funny.

Would you play it again?

Probably not but I might get the DLC at some point.

Any Complaints?

After how great the game was, I didn’t care for the boss. Other than that I thought this game was perfect."
TrophyHunter14,"Aug 24, 2018",6,"I thought it would be amazing, but I finished this game without even being really into it at any part. It is too hard in the beginning, but later on it gets to easy. I struggled so hard at the beginning just to find myself jawning later on because how easyt the game was. I passed the final boss from first try and it wasn't even close... The game is not completly awful but it is probably the most dissapointing game I have ever bought."
JohnsonStJonson,"Aug 18, 2018",8,"""Always bet on black""-Wesley Snipes. I feel this quote captures my sentiments towards this game perfectly. The setting of the game is pretty confusing, even if you have seen the LOTR movies 30 times(I haven't, but I know some of you nerds have). All questions of plot are lost when your eyes glimpse the sexy figure of our hero, your playable character. He doesn't have customizable features, which is probably a good thing because the populace of the game would run screaming from your ugly mug. The gameplay lasts around 15-20 hours. If you're a LOTR fanboy/fangirl(shout out to the honeys), there is enough LoTR content to keep you entertained solely on that aspect. The game is probably more of a hard 8 because it helped me get through the divorce of my wife. Actually, if you read this babe, I want you back.

actionist83,"Jul 31, 2018",8,"Shadow of Mordor is a good game but is a little overrated. The nemesis system truly made this game stand out, the combat was great, and the story was good. I loved how you could tackle a fight in multiple ways. The problems I have with this game include - enemy swarming, stiff/unresponsive controls (especially when sneaking around on ledges and climbing), a somewhat funky camera system, repetitive missions, and an underwhelming world.

BlitZeR_95,"Apr 28, 2018",8,I was not expecting this to be this good! This game has a hybrid between Batman Arkham series and Assassin's Creed gameplay. Nemesis system is AMAZING! The nemesis system is the highlight of this game making it very fun and interesting since the orcs have a mind of their own attacking other orcs or you. The story is quite interesting too but the final boss fight was the major disappointment.

Ajbras,"Apr 19, 2018",9,"Shadow of Mordor is a game that has some storyline issues and a few camera nuisances that are easy to overlook.  The game was extremely enjoyable even as a title that is pushing 4 years old.  I played through it for the first time over the last couple of weeks and really enjoyed the combat, the setting and the nemesis system.  Hunting specific Orcs kept the game entertaining throughout - I was always on my toes because I didn't know if a strong captain would show up in the middle of a mission.  The combat is fluid and easy to grasp after a while - as you get upgrades you'll start to adjust the way you play and feel like you are able to dominate even larger hordes.  The story is disjointed and was not at all the reason I kept coming back - but outside of the that I have a hard time nitpicking on anything else with the game.  I am still looking forward to going back and finishing the DLC and collecting the rest of the trophies in the game.  Would recommend to anyone that likes action games."

Exilionus,"Dec 16, 2017",0,"Not really sure what all praise is about with this game its complete trash.  It’s unplayable because the camera will make you nauseated, it’s the same enemies and its the same area design throughout the game.  It’s just one big hub not really an open world in my opinion, takes you literally less than a minute to run on the other side.  It’s more like an arena... rather than an open world with out any different locations to see.
It doesnt feel completed, the world is empty devoid of anything interesting to see.  The terrain looks like dinosaur poop and you’re surrounded by it all the time.  The X button is used fore everything, running, dashing, jumping... Which creates a huge problem when trying to get away from enemies.  Physics in this game doesnt exist... Almost nothing in the world gets destroyed by your arrow grenades or your weapons.
Lets go back to the camera, you’re fixed to looking down towards the horizon.  When trying to look around especially while running the camera wobbles instead of making a smooth transition.  As you begin to run the camera centers itself on your character.  A horrible design and concept... The fov is horrendous as well.
The game is boring... It’s the same moves over and over again; granted you get special moves but they’re really not eye candy.  Then theres this nemesis thing, I could care less abou it.  The story is interesting and pretty gory.  The voice acting is spite on and the fighting is crisp but the camera makes it nearly impossible to enjoy it.
Stealth in this game is a big part of the game which can be stressful.  We play games to have fun not take a lecture every five minutes on what to press.  My God does this game have so many tutorial tips... The worst part you can disable it doing so and you’ll have no idea what to do or how to handle yourself.  If you can put up with the camera great, but just a warning it’s not really open world and its the same boring bosses with different aesthetics. Still waiting for a good lots game, just seems its never going to happen."
XanferX,"Nov 15, 2017",9,Hack and slash at its best. What could be more enjoyable then sneaking behind and orch and stabbing him in the hearth only to spin around and decapitate another charging orc. This game features addictive gameplay mixed in with a genius boss and nemesis system that makes you want to keep playing. The story is not much to brag about but that is not the point of this game either. So if you like rolling orch heads this is a must get for you.

The combat is **** complete nonsense. Swords don't work that way. 1v1 or 1v3 is pretty fun, and it looks like the entire kit is built around dispatching 3-4 groups of enemies. When do you EVER fight 3-4 groups of enemies in the game? 1% of the time. Almost never.

It takes bloody ages to pick up your powerup in power struggles, and you have to do it or else 5000000000000000 other captains just happen to drive by. I've started a power struggle that went for 50 minutes straight because enemy captains just kept pouring in endlessly and endlessly and endlessly surrounded by more guys than dynasty warriors. I JUST WANT TO PICK UP MY DAMN LOOT FROM THE COUNTLESS I KILLED, GOD DAMN STOP SENDING IN ENEMIES.

It's a set of finely combat mechanics that doesn't bloody work with each other. It's like someone made a very good car chassis and a very good engine but the engine has no hope of ever fitting in the chassis, so they just glued the two together. This is bad game design."
Mikeb86,"Aug 20, 2017",6,"I really wanted to love this game and in some ways I did, combat is really good, I really like the whole nemesis mechanic, the big let down for me was when you defeat the first lot of war chiefs and move to the second big area to explore you realise you have to do the exact same thing again, it felt very lazy to me so much so it stopped my enjoyment instantly and still haven't finished it! Hope they step it up for the sequel and keep it fresh throughout the whole game instead of clear the chiefs in one area to do the exact same in the next, not cool!"
HolyHooligan,"Aug 17, 2017",8,"There are several things I liked about this game and several things I didn't care for. This review begins with the latter.

Negative:

1.) Repetitive map. Although the game designers have an appendices that lay out different orc strongholds and give a little brief overview of each, all the orc strongholds feel the same. It's the same story with all the map. Every area just feels the same. The only thing that is different between area to area is color and minor architectural changes.

2.) The nemesis system. It works well, but it would work better if orcs didn't only climb the ranks when you die. I didn't really die that often, so orcs often didn't rise up in rank all that often. As such, I didn't really see the nemesis system in its full splendor. Another solution would be to up the difficulty so you really feel intimated by the orc chieftains.

3.) Side quests seem meaningless and are kind of boring. There are a handful of different things to do in addition to the main quests. You can free human prisoners, unlock the legends of your weapons, complete challenges, and collect Ithildin and artifacts. For the majority of these, they only get you spending points to upgrade your character. They don't really retain their own personal storyline or contribution to the main story. There are exceptions, but for the most part the side quests feel rather contrived and are ultimately boring.

Pros:

1.) Fun combat. The combat in this game is really fun and surprisingly varied. It is as dynamic as the player's imagination. There are truly a plethora of ways you can go about attacking orcs and their fortresses, from simply running in and duking it out in hand to hand combat to stealthily running on the outskirts and poisoning their grog barrels, from mounting a giant graug to turning strategic orcs into your followers and making them battle amongst each other.

2.) The nemesis system. Whenever you play the game right, you can have special moments where you can manipulate orc chieftains and create internal battles, watching quietly from the sidelines, or partaking in the duels themselves. You can face up to a long-time enemy who keeps getting the best of you, or help a pet chieftain make it to the top. The possibilities are as wide as your imagination.

3.) The story. I think the story isn't the best in video game history (by a long shot). But for Tolkien fans, the game will be very entertaining. You will catch minor and major references to Tolkien lore. Also, the plot is a classic tale of revenge, with the motivating force to find out more about you and your special friends' past.

4.) Enemy design. You will be confronted with a lot of different kinds of enemies, and each requires a different strategy. There are at least different sorts of orcs that I can remember, along with very different orc chieftains, not including the different wild beasts you'll occasionally encounter.

5.) Excellent character upgrades. There will likely not be a time in the game where you won't be able to somehow upgrade your character (even once you finish the main game you'll probably still have a few upgrades you can get). And each upgrade is actually significant (some, naturally more than others). There's a whole web of upgrades just for Talion, the protagonist, and a separate web for Talion's weapons, his health, and his 'focus'.

This game has some seriously praiseworthy things about it. What's holding it back (which will fortunately be amended in the sequel) is that for every praiseworthy thing there is a minor flaw . All in all however, the game is really fun."
abysswalker9000,"Aug 9, 2017",9,"I hated this game at first. Brought it when it came out, played it once and hated it. It seemed a dull world, lacking creativity and imagination. There was no first person mode and the enemies all seemed the same. I died relentlessly. Some years later, needing to cut down on the thousands I spend on games I decided to revisit Shadow Of Mordor and give it another shot. Almost twelve hours of continuous play later I feel compelled to write a review. This game is a bleak, dark masterpiece of understated atmospheres and glorious sword play. Utterly immersive in its relentless fury and grim landscape you often find yourself entering a hypnotic transient state as you dispatch the Uruk-hai. Feeling at once omnipotent and vulnerable you become obsessed with stalking your despicable enemy and slaughtering those that escaped or killed you before in balletic blood lust. The fact these creatures remember you and bare the scar of your sword or Caragor only adds to the realism. As I stand here looking out over a grey, rain swept London skyline with the wind in my face I close my eyes. I stand on a Forge Tower in my true realm. My hair and cloak dance around me in the black rain. I am ready to settle old scores and incite new ones. With my spirit brother Celebrimbor I will avenge my loved ones that died at the hands of Sauron’s elite. Highly recommended."
SuperkenGaming,"Aug 6, 2017",8,"Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor
When Batman meets Assassins Creed
Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor is an action adventure game where you play as Talion, going after the black hand after he does something in the beginning of the game that I wont spoil…
But part of that something is killing you..
That’s right.. youre dead… sort of…
Youre stuck in limbo and seeking revenge.. but you soon find out youre attached to Elf Lord Celebrimbor who is also after the black hand… and with his power you turn into an assassins creed fans dream…
You can hop from these towers and really any location without taking damage leap of faith style..
The game is set in an open world takes place on 2 maps
and you can unlock fast travel points on the maps by climbing towers like assassins creed..
Climbing in this game is automatic, done by just holding down a button which can make for some frustrating getaway moments during combat as expected..
not as smoth as the later installments of assassins creed has become..
but these maps are crawling with side missions power struggles and collectables…
And there is actual incentive to star aside from the main story thanks to the different skill trees and leveling system in this game..
You of course aqquire skills by leveling up from killing orcs and completing quests… this lets you unlock new skilsl in your skill tree..
But to unlock more tiers in your skill tree you need more power..
power is acquired by taking out orcs in saurans army..
The first half of the game is all about climbing your way through the orc ranks and taking out the 5 warchiefs..
you do this by grabbing orcs, enetering their brains,, and getting intel on your target..
this intel will tell you their location, their strengths, power and their weaknesses…
And once you feel youre prepared to take them down you can go into a power struggle to eliminate them..
But you have to be sure youre ready because of the games nemesis system…
the combat here is fairly simple and plays like the batman arkham games and the ps3 assassins creed games…
you can stealth kill enemies from bushes, ledges, behind, or from above.. use your bow to head shot or zip through thin air for a devastating blow.. ride in on the back of an animal or monster you’ve taimed in the wild..
or you can go in batman style countering attacks and going for annoying finishers that take 20 years to pull off and are nearly impossible to pull off outside of a main mission…
This is my biggest complaint with the entire game…
These missions to dethrone orcs are extremely frustrating because the game expects you to be able to take on 30 at a time while in the story they only ask you to deal with like 5 or 6 at a time..
The variety here is a lot like the arkham games where you eventually have to stun enemies or jump over their shields just to make things more frustrating…
but every time you go to do a ground finisher itss get broken up because it takes so long to pull off, thankfully you are eventually able to pull of moves like executions once you get a hit streak going of 8 and later 5, but this doesn’t help these encounters from feeling cheap…
if you do get knocked down,. You will.. a lot.. you have the opportunity to do a quick time event to get up again 2 or 3 times.. but eventually you will just die or if you mess up youll just die,,
And dying makes things even worse as the orc that kills you will remember you, they get promoted in the ranks, and their power ioncreases making them even harder to take care of the next time…
And then there are the collectibles and sidemissions that increase your attribvutes like health as well as open rune slots for your sword, bow, and dagger, these runes are picked up off of warchiefs and captains…
Who also act as bodyguards…
so its important to take out a targets bodyguards before you attack them to make your encounter easier…
during the 2nd half of this 12 hours game.. you have to go through the same system..
this time however youre tasked with making your own army out of these orcs so you can challenge the black hand.. and you do this by your new ability to brand them..
Your goal is to now find a target and get them on your side..
you can either go right to a bodybuard or help your newly owed orc captain prove himself and become a bodybuard.."
visiblelight7,"Jul 21, 2017",6,"I played this game for many hours and i'm finally putting it down. I'm done, the novelty of the nemesis system and initial wow factor when encountering bosses with short introductions finally got old. Honestly, if you removed this, I would have not played this game past 2-3 hours. It's just a repetitive mindnumbing zerg fight after zerg fight. It's highly overrated IMO."
ItsAllOgre5,"Jul 6, 2017",3,"I'm so lucky I bought this during a sale when it was like $5. The graphics are nice, but everything else just feels like a crappy version of Batman Arkham. You just hold up as the guy automatically vaults over obstacles, and then there is the braindead combat and constant cutscenes. The game is so shallow, I could not survive 2 hours."
BITESCREEN,"Jun 22, 2017",8,"Schon Peter Jackson drückte J.R.R. Tolkiens Fantasy-Epos Der Herr der Ringe einen betont düsteren Stempel auf. Die Condemned-Macher Monolith besudeln ihr Open-World-Spiel Mittelerde – Mordors Schatten jedoch noch großzügiger mit Blut. Die Rachegeschichte um einen Totalwitwer, der sich als übermächtiger Halbgeist auf die Suche nach Antworten begibt, ist reines Alibi für ein brutales Gameplay: Waldläufer Talion köpft, verstümmelt und verbrennt ganze Orkarmeen, die Angriff-Konter-Finisher-Mechanik klaut das Actionspiel dabei frech aber nahezu perfekt bei Assassin’s Creed. Zum Glück schielt Monolith auch in puncto Schleichen Richtung Ubisoft, was das schicke Gemetzel auflockert und in Kombi mit zig Nebenmissionen und dem smarten Nemesis-System für große Unterhaltung sorgt. Das finstere Mordor mit seinen rauen Felsen, Höllenfeuern und Sklavenkolonien ist derweil die perfekte Kulisse."
badgerryan19,"Jun 19, 2017",8,Wow! If you are a Lord of the Rings game this is for you. With an awesome nemesis system and great combat you can't go wrong with this one. The story was pretty good as well but could of been better. Excited for the new one.
Peacen,"May 3, 2017",4,"With Shadow of War rapidly approaching, many will choose to sate themselves with the first in the series, Shadow of Mordor. This review is for you guys, and hopefully you'll read it before buying. I'm not going to bog this down with credentials. Suffice, I've played enough for long enough, and know, above most things, objectivity is key.

Shadow of Mordor is not a good game. It's not the steaming pile it's made out to be by its harsher critics, no, but it's also not very good. Breaking it down piecemeal:

Fighting mechanics are stolen from Assassins Creed and the Batman series, fused into a simplistic three button counter dependent system that sits just slightly below AC's variety. Fighting bottlenecks in proportion to the number of enemies, meaning the more there are, the fewer options you have and the more you must comply with the game's ideal scripted fight scenario. It's all massively flashy, but also massively repetitive. Environmental attacks are possible, but often feel very scripted, thought there are quite a few varieties. The game is heavily inclined to sneaking, which it does passably, but not well, and being spotted is a common occurrence.

Weapon selection is limited to three, all of which you gain from the start. Runes can be used to improve them and give attributes, which is a good mechanic that was unfortunately shallow. Damage upgrades are earned in tailored 'proving' quests. Application of these weapons is dictated by skill tree progression. There is a sense of achievement in the skill tree, making you feel like you're gaining strength with each notch, but there is no real versatility. It is obvious what you need, and what you'll upgrade early (ranged attacks are useless, early finishers are essential). If you fail to recognize this, later engagements become terribly long suffered and some downright impossible.

Overland travel is limited, stunted and slow. An early game upgrade allows short dashes to be activated by leapfrogging rocks to get you where you need to be (yes, you read that right). Talion climbs well enough, but you'll begin to notice very clear passages and footholds to starkly defined second and third floors, which lifts the veil on what you considered to be a clever entry point.

Enemies are varied, and kill animations are numerous. But SOM also sadly illustrates a very good idea gone wrong in a very thoughtless way: Immunities. Some Orc captains are immune to numerous damage types. You can't sneak stab, can't use arrows for headshots, etc. The problem is, instead of improving the actual fighting mechanics or skill of these tougher orcs, the game simply adds immunities. This is a broken mechanic, and once more forces a bottleneck. In addition, when an opponent can only be killed by aerial takedown, but the nearest chest high wall is four miles away, I can't exactly invite him with a phonecall. Resistances, not immunites, would've been the step back that completely fixed this issue.

The story is shamefully weak for a Tolkien inspired game. Character roster is limited to about a dozen (including NPCs, excluding the procedurally generated orcs), and though these few are well realized (never let it be said the game lacks polish on character models) their backdrops, being the environments you find yourself in, are bland and feel very samey. It is understandable that the world has been ravaged, but that's not much of an excuse for the barren nature of it. You get the feeling that you're one of the last men on earth, and not in a good heroic ascension kind of way. As a character, Talion is strong and virtuous, but also very flat. There's no progression to his grief. And grief this man has (should have) much of.

Lastly, the nemesis system is essentially pokemon without visual battles, gyms or a final boss. Before you're sold on the hype and bootlicking, know that there are no benefits to 'finishing' it. It's a collect-a-thon with no payout. And with Talion's abysmal walking speed, intervening when necessary to advance your chosen orc becomes a case of racing to keep in-game appointments you're essentially setting for yourself.

I didn't enjoy SOM. It could've been much more and I think a lot of the love for it stems from the want for the old days of the intense LoTR games. But it isn't those games, and for an open world, it's surprisingly devoid of content. Everything is essential to your quest in becoming the greatest orc murderer there ever was, save for one or two Gollum missions added to break up the monotony. This is a shame, because it makes the world feel very dead.

I can only conclude that many reviewers here seem to have been raised on less than excellent value, game wise, to give such shining reviews. Don't get me wrong, it's okay for it to not be good, to enjoy a game for inherent elements that appeal to you. But objectivity is vital to improvement. And improvement, in the case of SOM, is a necessity if games that follow it are to rise above this"
HaloFever,"Apr 24, 2017",7,"Shadow of Mordor is a fun game but I am reluctant to give it more than a 7 out of 10. Gameplay is great and the nemesis system is inspired. The world, however open it may be, is small and the story is pretty much non-existent. The few cutscenes are nice.

What makes Shadow of Mordor work is the personality of the orcs you slaughter by the hundreds. The run of the mill Orcs have their generic chatter and taunts. You don't care about them. You want the leaders. The leaders do not disappoint. They have unique looks and personalities to match. They have different dialogue if they previously defeated you, if you ever ran from them, or if you ever defeated them. The highest level leaders have their own theme music. I've really never seen anything like it. The nemesis system gives them life as each Orc leader remembers your last encounter with them.

The nemesis system then goes to the next level in the second half of the game. Not to spoil the story, but instead of just killing Orcs, you build an army of Orcs. This means making sure your allies win duels and work their way towards becoming war chiefs. It's a wonderful flip from the first half of the game and my only complaint is that babysitting Orcs becomes repetitive and annoying near the end of the game. The effort seemed worth my time when my little army cut through the enemy forces like a hot knife through butter.

Combat itself is simple enough and is almost identical to the Arkham games. What surprised me was the effectiveness of the bow. Usually these kinds of fighting games give you weak ranged weapons so you can't pick off enemies from a distance. Instead, Shadow of Mordor embraces the idea of sniping from an unreachable position. With a fully unlocked bow, you can defeat most gangs of Orcs and even some Orc leaders without setting foot on ground. I felt liberated not just because encounters become more strategic but also because it felt good to down these Orc ****.

Where the game lacks is in the size of the world and scope of the story. Most of the time, I had no idea how my actions connected to the story. At it's heart, the game is a revenge tale. Then a couple of people show up and you do missions for them for no apparent reason. The story hook of the game seems to be flashbacks of the tale of Celebrimor, the person who forged rings for Sauron. The problem with this hook is that 1) the cutscenes are scant and brief; and 2) the do not progress the story you are playing. The snide personality of the protagonist, Talion, doesn't help. Some semblance of story progress would have helped the 20ish hours of repeating the same encounters in the same locations in the tiny land of Mordor.

As open world games go, this is the smallest open world I have seen. Perhaps this is an issue with the last generation of consoles, as Shadow of Mordor was released for them as well. The textures are also low rez and do no service to the excellent animations. I wonder, though, if the problem was created by cutting content to then sell as DLC. Maybe the plans for this game were never ambitious. It seems in whole to be less than a $60 AAA game should offer. Full disclosure: I picked up this game for free back in January of 2015 and waited until April 2017 to play it. I try to divorce the cost **** from my impression, but this this generation of games if full of examples that challenge that intent. Let me just say that I believe more content would have made this game better."
Nednerb,"Mar 30, 2017",7,"Picture Batman in in Middle Earth.  That is what Shadow of Mordor is.  The game is pretty much a carbon copy of Arkham Origins/City except you are in a different world, playing a different hero and fighting different villains.  Without a doubt Shadow of Mordor is the best Lord of the Rings game available to date, however the fun and excitement that you get out of the game from the movie you love is short lived and the game becomes quite repetitive.  For the trophy hunters obtaining the platinum is relatively easy with one or two semi-tough trophies in the DLCs."
Kritik_king,"Mar 29, 2017",8,"Shadow of Mordor was a gift that I received and I had no preconceived notions.  As such, I was very pleasantly surprised by this game, and enjoyed it a lot.

Visually the game looks good.  The enemies are varied in appearance and as interesting to look at as they are repulsive (in a good way).  A lot of effort was put into the voices and appearance of the captains and leaders and it shows.  The environment is interesting with its background and structures and ruins look good.  It is fairly obvious that this was made with the last generation in mind and not much effort was made in updating the graphics for PS4.  It is not bad unless you get a close up look at characters.

Overall map size is ok.  It seems quite large at the beginning, but by the end seems a little small.  Luckily as you advance the story you are able to unlock other maps that look different but offer otherwise the same things: orcs, wild beasts and ruins/fortifications.  Sounds and aesthetics are also very good.

The linear storyline is quite compelling and it is interesting and compelling to advance the story, complete missions and level up your character and abilities.  It really is very fun to watch your character turn into an absolute orc killing machine, and the number of abilities keep it interesting.  You are only equipped with a bow, long sword and ""dagger"", but the wraith abilities and weapons upgrades keep things fresh.

The nemesis system was really a big selling point and it is quite interesting.  I found the system to be unique and adding a good dimension to the game play, as it turned what could have been just an elegant hack 'n slash into a strategic game.  You were able to do research on your enemies, and then using those to your advantage in order to beat them.  This is really useful in the beginning of the game, but as you power up, it outlives its usefulness because you essentially become a one man army.  It was satisfying to see the chain of command change in response to your killing of enemies or dying at their hands.  It was also served a useful purpose in understanding who was under control of whom and to see your network of allied commanders.  That said, the system seems like it can be expanded, and I certainly hope we get to see increased depth with the next installment.

The combat is where this game really shines.  It essentially plays like Assassin's Creed, but the wraith abilities introduce a whole new dynamic.  Nothing else made you feel like a BAMF than when you take on a horde of orcs and leave a pile of bloody corpses and command a small orc contingent from wraith branding.  Being able to brand creatures and use them as mounts was also extremely satisfying and can straight up be overpowered in boss battles.  The controls are tight and once you used to how you attack, stun, brand and parry, you will find battles extremely satisfying.

With all the awesome abilities you can unlock, you will inevitably become almost invincible in the end game.  This is especially true if you complete the game, as it allows you to continue to roam the map and take out leaders and just generally muck about.  I find that I don't even care now if they call for reinforcements (what was a death sentence in the early game) because no amount of normal enemy can touch me.  The only exception are bosses that have a ""poisoned"" blade attribute that is essentially a one hit K.O.  It isn't unusual to take at least one hit for damage when fighting bosses and it is absolutely unforgiving with the poisoned blades.  Other attributes make the boss battles more interesting, like being immune to range attacks (can't hit them with a bow) or not being able to vault over and stun them (which is a very basic and extremely important tactic throughout the entire game).  However none of these are as frustrating as the poisoned enemy blade.

The main downfalls of this game are its lack of replayability and the gameplay can get monotonous.  Once I had finished the game, I was satisfied with the ending but did not feel compelled to start another play through, and I still have not done so after two years of owning it.  I would also feel like I needed a break after some of the gameplay felt monotonous, having executed my 10th ""run over here and kill this dude"" mission.  That said, they keep it more varied than other games with similar play styles, like Assassin's Creed.

This game is well worth checking out, especially at a discounted or price.  It has me interested in the upcoming sequel as well and if they can stay true to what made Shadow of Mordor so great, they will have a great successor."
MarshallBuzz,"Mar 25, 2017",8,"Very nice game and very addictive this new system called ""Nemesis"", a revolution of gaming.
The story is the bad thing of the game because is too short and the strong part... again... is the nemesis system, not the history and much less the secondary missions."
LordMOrion,"Mar 21, 2017",2,"This is a poor game. The combat is repetitious and the penalty for losing just one boss fight can be massive. The orcs try to have different personalities but they end up all sounding the same. I get the basis of the Nemesis system but its actual implementation in this game feels extremely forced. I'll be honest and say that I really did not enjoy this game, I cannot bring myself to finish it. The colour palette just makes me think of an old quarry. Everything is just a chore and I don't find it particularly rewarding."
MAFIAxMaverick,"Mar 19, 2017",8,"I haven't had as much fun with a ""new"" (2 years later) mechanic in a game as I have with Shadow of Mordor. The Nemesis System was a pleasant surprise for me and I can't wait to see what they do with it in Shadow of War. Gameplay mechanics are fluid and rewarding. It's a game worthy of all the praise it's received over the years and the added expansions are a lot of fun. Knocks on it for a mediocre story and issues with the lore. I had to keep telling myself this game isn't trying to be canonical and that helped a bit."
PsychoShane123,"Feb 15, 2017",2,"An ugly, boring world with no life or character, a story that's forgettable in every sense and combat you have seen elsewhere. Overrated for its ""nemesis"" system. ."
Leo_Manzano,"Jan 27, 2017",9,With a decent storyline what really draws attention in Shadow of Mordor are its mechanics that are extremely fun combat is fluid and the possibilities to kill your enemies are varied that added to the mechanics of captains and revenge whenever an enemy kills you it stays The stronger the whole experience involving the addictive game causing the player to easily lose hours playing.
Nel,"Jan 10, 2017",8,"Great game has a lot of  fun gameplay, and it has great animations which makes it a joy to play.  The story is great, and you feel like your upgrade does something, and the moves are easy to execute. Really fun game for fans of the lore, and first timers."
TheChosenOne7,"Jan 10, 2017",9,"Excellent game. The game play carries the game, the story is interesting enough, and the character development is pretty good. The environment is spot on and the orcs are portrayed perfectly. The DLC is decent. Only flaws are the very repetitive quests (which the amazing game play makes up for mostly), the difficulty is too easy (only gets difficult when you're fighting 30+ urki mixed with the dual wielding ones and shield ones with 2 or more captains/war chiefs), which even then is too easy if you just spam certain powers. 8.5/10 would give it a 9.3/10 if it had more of a challenge and more diversity of quests."
DenverPike,"Dec 27, 2016",6,"Story - 5 - This game has a confusing and unfortunately boring story. The game jumps too soon to the middle of the action without letting us understanding what and why is happening. And after finishing the game I still did not know what the hell happened.

Characters - 5 - The characters (which have dialogs) don't have much personality, all dialogs are boring with absolutely no point.

Gameplay - 6 - I hope I was not the only one to think that the gameplay is a poor version of Batman/Assassins Creed. You will spend 80% trying to kill everyone by stealth because the fighting is atrocious. You will button smash a lot with your eyes wide open for that counter attack button which by the way you only have 1 second to react to it in the middle of 20 orcs. I also hate when there is no limit spawning and Orcs just keep flooding you.
The climbing becomes hard as the camera fixes horizontally and makes it harder for you to know where you are going. I also felt the camera was too close and therefore making fighting and running around so much harder.

Graphics - 8 - The character models are amazing sculpted and look really nice. The environment tho, I felt like it needed some more dirtiness and darkness (this is Mordor FFS)

Sound - 2 - If you are expecting some epic music, think again. The soundtrack was completely off for a Lords of the Rings game. Sometimes I felt like I was playing King of Hearts or something like that.

Overall - 6 - I felt like the game is not as good as many say. Okay fine the Nemesis aspect of the game is a really good idea and it does work. Sometimes I felt like dying to a certain Orc to see what would happen, but the rest of the game is very poor. The missions are very short and few. If you are like me and bought this game, I feel sorry for you."
MaxPayneIsGod,"Dec 18, 2016",10,"As late to the party as I am I can tell you that this game is awesome and thoroughly entertaining.  Not being a huge LoTR fan I (wrongfully) steered clear of this title for a couple of years.  The combat is functionally fun, although not overly complex it follows precedents set by the Arkham titles and Mad Max.  The game is pretty big, took me 33 hours to Platinum, but that 33 hours was 33 hours of fun.  Where Shadow of Mordor shines is it's Nemesis AI system.  The way your enemies remember you and hunt you down is something that surprisingly hasn't been copied by anyone else, although the system relies heavily on the narrative to work, its still a very cool idea.  The skill trees are worthwhile and meaningful and the game draws you into Mordor extremely well.
If you are a fan of the Arkam games and Mad Max, and especially if you are a LoTR fan you cannot miss this stellar title!"
pongkrit03,"Dec 14, 2016",7,"Just have a chance to play this GOTY game. The combat system is pretty much similar to Batman. However, the game's theme is like assassin creed, which you will have to kill a lot of enemy's generals.

The game is fun and challenging. Story is mediocre. The world looks so bland and the game become repetitive fast since most of your activities are killing enemy generals. I like the idea of interrogating enemies in order to grasp general's weaknesses. However, in later half of the game, this feature is not helpful anymore since most generals have no easy weaknesses.

It is a good game, however very far from GOTY in my opinion."
Archulysses,"Dec 12, 2016",8,"Story - The game begins on the time when the black captains used Talion and his family as blood sacrifice in order to summon and use Celembrimbor, but due to unforeseen events, Celebrimbor possessed the body of Talion which resurrected him and together must work together to get vengeance against the black captains. The story overall is a bit cliche but interesting main characters as well as supporting characters and cameo appearances saves it. esp. Celembrimbor which is the most interesting character in the game. A score of 7/10.

Gameplay - The gameplay is a mix of Arkham series (fighting) and the assasin's creed series (platforming and exploration), despite it lacking creativity, it is still executed properly and without major or significant problems. But the strength of the game doesnt really revolves on those but to its nemesis system, an advanced gameplay mechanic in which you control using wraith powers the Uruk officers in game and use them to wreck havoc against their fellow Uruks. Such an amazing feat added in game and is the main reason why the game is really good. The only and biggest weakness i have for this game also is in this aspect, which is the very bad boss fight...I wont spoil it to you, but all boss fights in game are bad and unremarkable in that regard. Still though, Ill give it a great score of 9/10 due to that unique nemesis system.

Graphics - This game is also one of those which was released both in the last and current gen consoles and is also in my opinion looks significantly better in the current consoles. The environments are good like the dead world of the first map and the greenish and more alive world on the second map, with regards to the design and layout, the overall map is small and can be easily covered. Its not a minus though. As to the character design, overall, i really liked it. From Talion's rugged image to Celembrimbor's ghostly image is really great designs in game, The Uruks also are nice since even though some are reused models, they are still distinguishable due to different armor designs. The thing i really liked though is how their image change if you have hurt of burned them too. A score of 9/10.

Sound and music - I liked the voice acting of the characters and the enemies in game, it is smooth, spot on and really gives life to the character they try to portray. As to the music however, i never really remembered anything nor did i hear anything good. A score of 7/10

Overall = 8.00

This is one of the underdog games of 2014 that surprised everyone and is the runner up for the most GOTYs of that year and it is really deserving of the credit and rewards it has recieved. This game showed that it is not bad to get ideas from other games so long as you can execute it smoothly and for being creative in making such a good gameplay mehanic with its nemesis system and also the advanced ai the enemies have. The Boss battles needs a lot of improvement and i hope they would do that in the sequel. It is awesome. Thanks!"

Tselel,"Jul 26, 2016",8,"Another GOTY worthy of 2014. This game for is the dark horse of that year. Nobody knew or bothered with this game until it came out and boom!! Most of the gamers loved the game. As for my review, first the pros, the dead like environment is very good and places nicely on the game, the gameplay is smooth and the enemy AI is top notch that they can think for themselves if left alone and finally, the pride of the game: The Nemesis System, the way you control the orc army, who you brand, who you want to start a riot and much more things to be creative of. However, like all, every game had its cons too. First, I know it fits nicely with the game and became original with nemesis system, but the majority of its gameplay is just borrowed content with assasin's creed and arkham series. Its like the poor mans version of both of the mentioned games. Next con. Is it mediocre plot and main character. I dont care about him nor did i care about both of them and the plot is so cliche that i find myself more interested to the lore in the collectibles than in the game. Next is its BAD BOSS BATTLE, and when i mean BAD, ITS THE WORST. No memorable boss fight, the most badass character of tolkien chronicles (sauron) did just a cameo in the final battle. damn, they should be embarassed they even bother putting garbage in the final fight. Lastly and worst for me is that THE WHOLE MAIN STORY IS JUST A FREAKING TUTORIAL. You only get the most interesting part of its game in the middle of the second half of the story and there'll be little to no content to experiment and enjoy that gameplay. Regardless, despite the having flaws and issues, for being a published game, It is still THE best Tolkien Chronicles game that has ever released in the gaming world. Hope they do better in its next installment. Ill be waiting and keep supporting them."
omer123,"Jul 22, 2016",9,this is how lord of the ring games must be stunning visual fantastic story superb gameplay it had 20 missions th game is not too long  but the mission are not that great but still some element in the game let it amazing like a gameplay taking a half assassins creed +half  batman arkham= shadow of mordor in controls combat and a little stealth is batman gameplay the other like climb and hiding in haystacks  is like assassins creed skill three 3 weapons in this game sword and bow and dagger u use the dagger for steealth takedowns and swords to kick enemys asses bow even for stealth and hunting some of skill point make the bow sow **** great if u hold the L2 button and press squar any running enemys u will magickly  kills then cut there heads of it feels bad ass and u can brand any enemy those enemy well be your ally to defend u if u brand them u can gain intel to any of those captains or legendary captains these gameplay is satesfing i realy like this game the final verdic is 9.5 out of 10
chayshirin,"Jul 5, 2016",6,"The bad:
Way too easy
non existing AI
useless collectibles and side quests

The good:
runs smooth

In short your typical assassin's creed under a new guise"
Greghead,"Jun 30, 2016",6,"I have mixed feelings about this game. Some elements of gameplay show glimpses of genius, whilst other elements feel unfinished and below par. Boss fights can be really good fun, but the game overall does suffer from a lack of flair.
For LOTR fans, this is a must buy. But for others who are mildly intrigued by it, try before you buy, or pick it up second hand."
Wolf4642,"Jun 27, 2016",8,This game is one of my favorites. I love the open world part of it that lets you do almost whatever you want. My only problem with it is there weren't enough story missions.
XenoFantasy1,"Jun 24, 2016",9,One of the most fun and unique open world games i have ever played. The nemesis system gives this game almost endless replayability and adds a lot of depht to the small but great open world. Gameplay is fluid and always fun with a great diversity of story and side missions. The story is just ok but has a interesting premise.
GodHades100,"Jun 24, 2016",4,"Shadow of Mordor is one of the best games i have ever played.Amazing grahpics , gameplay ,action.. Its really amazing BUT this game becomes really boring.  I have spent approximately 25 hours playing this game and i seriously dont want to touch it again . The enemies are the same . The only thing you do is killing orks . The world is really small. if you like playing games for maximum 30 hours then get it but if you want a game to spend over 30 hours then dont buy thi game"
DragonBorn-,"Jun 24, 2016",8,"This game is excellent. Completely different to whats out there at the moment. Its sort of  like a hybrid of Assassins Creed, Arkham City and Dragon Age for me.

Pro's -

Excellent graphics.
Solid story-line.
Good rank-up system.
Smooth, free flowing game play.
Top notch battle mechanics (similar to the Batman games).
Originality.

Con's -

Can get a little repetitive.
No difficulty level options. Personally I found the game far too easy.
The ending is a huge anticlimax.
The 'open' world isn't actually that open and the backdrop could be more detailed.

TBH the con's are quite picky, i had to think for a while to come up with the list, whereas the pro's just rolled off the tongue straight away.

Overall Shadow of Mordor is an excellent game and the edition of Parkour into the mix makes for a real fun 30+ hours of fun (if you 100% the game). Definitely one of the best games of 2014.

8/10"
alexaxa,"May 22, 2016",8,"Killing orcs have never felt so good ! The only thing that bothered me is that some skill in the skill tree could not get upgraded before you're past some story mission (since i'm a completionist, i tend to do ALL side missions available before doing the story mission) but beside that, it's a good game !"
Lord_V,"May 17, 2016",9,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
EliteGames,"May 13, 2016",10,Simply put the best PS4 game ever released!!! SOM is an amazing sandbox game that really puts you in the shoes of a boots on the ground war general. The unique enemy leveling system is amazing and refreshing.  There is nothing better then the sweet revenge of getting an enemy that killed you in a previous battle and moved up the ranks.  This living world is amazing and if you haven't picked it up you should do so right away.  You won't regret it!
TheTrurth,"May 11, 2016",9,Unique and challenging something hard to find in the video game world nowadays. You are wasting your time reading a review when you should be playing the darn game!
Chowda,"May 2, 2016",8,"I only played about 10 hours and quit. Very repetitive and frustrating. The wall mechanic is game breaking. If you are running and come close to a wall you stop and stick to the wall like you are in stealth mode. I am not a fan of the ""kill 5 Uruks with headshots"" tasks as it feels like a test and not a game. It is essentially a giant fetch quest as the map tells you where everything is.

However, if you are a fan of the Assassin's Creed or Batman series you might enjoy this game. The game is very well done but just not my style. And the nemesis system is pretty innovative and fun."
JS99,"Apr 13, 2016",9,"I like this game.  I really thought it was a mistake to buy a movie tie-in game but this one is fun.  The combat is fast paced and a joy to play.  The kill and move animations are outstanding.  I loved the Nemesis system. I was actively hunting down and marking enemies.  The story was a little thin, but the game play and mechanics were terrific.  Tons of replay value."
Tailynd,"Apr 8, 2016",7,"Love the way you fight in this game, same fighting engine as Batman Arkham.  But a little easy and the story wasn't interesting or engaging.  But a fun game and the Nemesis system was a cool experience"
Jpwr39,"Apr 6, 2016",6,I'm a huge LotR fan and really wanted to enjoy this game but just couldn't . A very overrated game. Don't understand all the high ratings tbh. The game is impressive at first but gets dull and repetitive quickly. Nemesis system is interesting though as others have said it's basically a rip off of Assasins Creed and Batman Arkham.
jordancotton,"Mar 30, 2016",8,"I was going to give this game a 7 but then i realized it's actually a great improvement from the previous gen. The graphics are more than mildly improved and the game has a swift combat and a good skills upgrade system. However, the story is bad not the worst but it fails at a lot of things. Your constantly killing trolls and getting in to fights a long the way... which are also with trolls. It's just a game of constant assassinations on trolls. In addition, if you are in to a game that has good graphics and constant fighting with trolls then it's worth a play.

Pros
- a great improvement from it's earlier release
- combat is quality
- runs smoothly
- AI varies

Cons
- fails for a good story
- not a great amount of enemies
- not enough concentration on why you are playing the game"
mikepango,"Mar 22, 2016",9,"I must say this game is so much fun. A lord of the rings story, with Batman & Assassin's Creed game play. Look good, plays good, story is good (i don't know how die hard LOTR fans will feel about it) The one real down side for me was the size of the open world and variations of the locations. Every thing takes place in Mordor so things kind of look the same for the most part. A must play in my book."
Kurgaan,"Mar 20, 2016",9,Easily the best LotR game to date. Interesting story that doesn't break the mythos of Tolkien and really varied and engaging combat. Graphics and sound are top notch.
Jbird1994,"Mar 16, 2016",10,"I have put an easy 30-40 hours of playing into this game prior to getting the season pass. The graphics were beautiful. The faces of each orc, although can sometimes be repetitive, were gorgeous and can tell how emotional/ tragic there face was. The game play itself was amazing, the fighting style was very close to a batman. With a few different characteristics embedded. I loved the story line, it wasn't an ohhh SH!!!T cant believe that happened, but not dull like Destiny. It definitely was worth my $60 dollars at that time. Honestly, one of the best games I've played on the PS4. LOTR definitely did not disappoint me, i believe this game to be a very under hyped, which probably made it to be such an amazing game all together, a must buy!"
Fra-k,"Mar 15, 2016",8,"The greatest game about Tolkien's world.
Great combat, a lot of lore, magnificent landscapes.

The main issue?
It's too short. Just two maps...incredibly detailed, but i'd really love to revisti the other regions of middle earth."
ursynhu,"Mar 10, 2016",10,"Este jogo é incrível! Eu recebi e ainda não posso parar de jogar. Os gráficos são tão detalhadas para um game e é desafiador, mas divertido e terá que jogar por horas! A história é complexa e profundamente pensado. O melhor jogo que eu já joguei de forma"
OwnedKill,"Mar 8, 2016",10,"Sou fan da história, é um jogo fantástico jogabilidade boa, a dinâmica  de combate é a mesma do que a do Batman, jogo lindo mesmo muito bem feito."
AhmayVee,"Feb 22, 2016",3,"This game has beautiful landscapes and is fun for the first several missions, but then turns into a very frustrating and defeating game. There are WAY too many enemies that spawn and it seems endless. I understand that in order to defeat specific enemies one has to achieve combos, but it becomes impossible with the amount of enemies that spawn. There is no real direction to the game. You are thrown into the world with too many options and every way you turn from the very beginning it seems that you are over matched and enemies are too strong. The mechanics are okay and the games explains moves well, but the game is overwhelming with the amount of enemies and small space on the map. This game turned from potentially fun to way too frustrating to finish."
FearTheOldBlood,"Feb 17, 2016",7,"Good game but the last boss fight was soooooo easy, a simple QTE fight! C'mon, I expected something more. Everything building up to the last fight should be epic, not a bore."
BaronMonaco,"Feb 10, 2016",8,"Shadow of Mordor is an appealing title with nice graphics and of course the beloved universe of Lord of The Rings would it live up to those expectations, well I believe it does.

First as I said the game looks good with a lot of details it also runs perfectly fine without any frame-drops even when there is a lot of characters on the screen and without any bug.

The story may be the weak point of the game with undeveloped characters and missions that, for the most part, have too simple level-design it will not remain in your gamer memories. The universe could be more developed too with a bigger map with more locations and also more diversity in the enemies and allies, but it's still a pleasant world to play in.

The side activities are a little repetitive too, but the Army system is a true marvel and will provide infinite content, it took me 30 hours to finish the game with approximately 10 of them spend only to slaying captains (in other words expect 20 hours to finish the game at 100 percent).

But the game shines thanks to its gameplay, clearly inspired by Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham series it also adds its own touch with the Wraith that gives you unique abilities like mounting wild beasts, controlling enemies or the nemesis system. I enjoyed every bit of the game.

With Shadow of Mordor it seems Warner finally found the right formula to make great Lord of The Rings games, they still have to build on it, particularly increase the diversity in the game and not the same generics characters and story."
Lucasmaroun,"Jan 18, 2016",10,"I bought this game and i really enjoyed it . Graphics and Combat in this game are so good story is perfect . I spent about a 25 hours to finish the game (side missions,collectibles,main missions) . People say this game is like assassins creed and i think yes but this game is better the map is so big and there are a lot of monsters,
Orcs . THIS GAME IS REALLY GOOD. Go buy it :)"
stamito,"Jan 8, 2016",8,"You like sandbox games?, give this one a try. This is a pretty good game, it is not a masterpiece but it is quite enjoyable.  Bad things, the characters are not awesome but they’re good enough. The setting is good but I felt it was a bit repetitive, there is only 2 areas which are kind of different but at the same time similar; I know it is Mordor…and I know it is supposed to be kind of monochromatic but still you can spend quite a lot of hours playing this game and, in my opinion, the map is a bit repetitive and kind of empty (compared e.g. to GTAV). The final boss is a bit disappointing. Good stuff, the action gameplay is good, some people say it is repetitive but, in my opinion it only is if you want it to be. Let’s face it, the game is easy, and it is quite easy to just say I’ll go around just swinging my sword and it’ll be fine that’ll do. However, there are quite a decent number of different skills and different ways of killing the war chiefs (e.g. direct approach, poisoning grog, taking advantage of a mutiny or what scares them, possession etc.).  So, yes you can make this game really simple and repetitive if you want and go CBA, but it is potentially varied in the ways you can approach your enemies and if you take advantage of that you’ll have a lot more fun. Finally, the story is not awesome, but it is all right, good enough."
PeterAlexander,"Jan 7, 2016",10,"Shadow of Mordor has a jaw-dropping combat system with a rich open world and a haunting story to match it. The game took me right back to Middle Earth, and had as immersed as I had been since the LOTR trilogy. The open world looks stunning, with some of the best graphics in any game to date. It is the combat system that truly puts this game on legendary status however. Fighting orcs is one thing, but fighting them with such an immersive style of combat is truly engaging. With Assassin's Creed like gameplay and an interactive Orc system that progresses depending on events that play out, this game will have you never wanting to leave Mordor."
3126235,"Jan 4, 2016",2,I have never played a game with such an unfair difficulty (at least not in the ps3/ps4 era). The game is terribly balanced in a way that makes it simply unfair to play. The game map is tiny and the story is incredibly boring
anichels,"Jan 1, 2016",9,"This game was marketed as a badass game, looks like a badass game, and plays like a badass game.
On top of that LOTR theme and lore is absolutely wonderful. It's a compliment to the franchise."
Crux037,"Dec 29, 2015",9,"The review isn't a 10 because the story end is the only bad part (just like No Country for Old Men): by the rest, it's an all-around great game, specially for fans of the Lord of the Rings universe."
Crisiscore7iet,"Dec 16, 2015",10,"This game is just amazing!!! It has great combat, (like the arkham games and Assassin creed), wonderful environemtn with great graphics, and a great story. After you beat the game, theres still stuff you can do, and it took me about 30-0 hours ot complete everything. The nemesis system was very interesting to. I highly reccomend this gameto anyone who likes the Arkham games, Lord of the Rings, or Assassin creed."
GreenMachineG,"Dec 9, 2015",10,"Shadow of Mordor is my favorite LOTR game I have ever played. The combat, gameplay mechanics, and story are great. The game feels like a blatant copy of Assassin's Creed or Batman: Arkham, but I didn't care at all. they take the great gameplay parts of those games and throw and LOTR skin over it? Yes please, more please. I had a great time with the game.

The combat and gameplay mechanics are very fluid and clean. You definitely feel very powerful as you progress through the game, and the fighting sequences are a ton of fun.

The Assassin's Creed-feel to the game comes in the way the map is set up with several collectible-esque things to find, as well as the towers revealing the map. I thought they did it in good taste though with the collectibles needing a little mini challenge to be completed to get some of them, which was always fun.

Attacking the orc generals was a very cool part of the game. I found myself posting up high and watching the orc camps for as long time planning out my attack. The weaknesses and strengths added just enough to make the need for some strategy necessary, which I liked.

I did however find the orc mind control a little disappointing. The game advertised orcs that would always remember you and that you could mind control and shoot up the hierarchy so you could control an army of orcs. This mechanic wasn't even available until later in the game, and wasn't quite as in depth as I thought going into it, but this is really my only issue with the game.

In closing, the LOTR fan will love this game, and any fans of the Assassin's Creed or Batman series' could definitely get into it. The game offers a lot in story and amazing gameplay. Definitely a recommended game.

8.9/10"
desoul,"Dec 8, 2015",8,"very cool game

the good:
combines the best elements from assasins creed (blekh) and batman arkham series.
nice open world
very cool fighting mechanics
the best thing about this game is the orc captains.

the bad:
story is not that great
final bosses looked cool but were really easy.

usually these types of games would be boring, but theres some added elements in this game that makes it a lot more fun than the generic open world game."

gdiego135,"Dec 3, 2015",8,"This game is BADASS!!!!!!!! Warner Bros may have copied Batman's combat style but they didn't put it to shame in fact i think it's better. Shadow of Mordor is brutally gory and a helluva joy to play, the graphics are gorgeous and chopping off orcs heads feel fantastic, the only flaws i have is the bad boss fight at the end, the world feels empty and the combat can feel repetitive after a while but put that aside because it's worth buying."
JustinElliot,"Dec 2, 2015",8,if you want to because a bada$$ sword slicing and dicing killing machine look no further. the fighting mechanics borrow a little from batman plus some intense violence which is uncomfortably satisfying.
Callum1996,"Dec 2, 2015",9,"Shadow of Mordor is a really fun challenging game, the graphics are brilliant which is a plus! The fighting system is similar to assassins creed and batman engine which offers great options for example counter kills and stealth kills. The main storyline is fantastic and the ending is so tense! Only down fall is the fact of using limited bow shots however I can see why they added that for certain reasons. 9/10 definitely worth a buy and I am almost sure you will love it :)"
SNES_is_best,"Nov 26, 2015",9,"Very solid game. It's essentially a well done Assassin's Creed with some nice additions giving it a little more original feel. If you like Creed, definitely grab this one."
Hectik,"Nov 23, 2015",9,"I recommend to LOTR fans and also AC and Batman Arkham as it utilizes similar if not better combat mechanics.

Pros: Great visuals, chopping off Orc heads really satisfying, nemesis system brings a uniqueness to the game, DLC skills missions brings replayability

Cons: Main character somewhat boring, need Online Co op like the old LOTR games, end boss really disappointing"
bigboss1964,"Nov 21, 2015",8,"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor

Game-Play:The game-play in this game is very similar to the Batman Arkham series and the climbing to the Assassin's Creed series but that is not bad just not **** game-play flows very well when you play and I really loved it .Their is a little stealth in the game but mostly action .The game also have some RPG elements .

Story:The story is good but I did not like the ending that much .But it is a good addition to the lord of the rings.

Graphics;I did not like the graphics that much I think that it should have been better.

Notes:There is not much else to say about the game expect that this is a great game and deserves the fullprice ."
Jalmerk,"Nov 16, 2015",7,"Shadow of Mordor offers a fun, satisfying and brutal combat experience, but in the end, there isn't really much variety to speak of. You will be killing orcs throughout the entire game, and towards the end your character will be so overpowered that it kinda **** the fun out of it all. Ironically the very first Warchief you face in the game, is considerably more difficult than the final boss of the game. If you can get this game used or on discount, knock yourself out!"
drlowdon,"Nov 9, 2015",8,"Shadow of Mordor does repeat some of the mistakes that other open world games have made in the past, such as the inclusion of some pretty dull missions and rather repetitive sidequests, but when all is said and done this is very good game.

The games strongest aspect is without doubt the 'Batman: Arkham Asylum' style combat and fortunately the developers have made sure that it makes up much of the game. Even when 20+ hours into the game the perfect controls and unlockable special moves, that include teleportation and executions, ensure it never gets dull.

On top of this you have what is being called 'the nemesis system', possibly the best new feature in gaming of the last five years. Put simply it means that the enemy captains and war-chiefs are directly influenced by their interactions with you. If they kill you they will gain promotions and gloat about their victory, adding a huge incentive for you to seek revenge. If you can defeat them you can either kill them or put them under control, giving orders to murder your other enemies or betray their war-chief. It all adds up to make for a far less linear experience than a lot of other open world games as there are always different ways to tackle the situations that arise.

Whether you are a fan of Lord of the Rings or not this is a must play."
Sparkticle,"Nov 6, 2015",9,"Really fun game. Might be short on content, because it's a small world, don't expect the same amount of things to do as you would in, say, Witcher 3, but this game wasn't trying to be Witcher 3. It was trying to be Assassins Creed combined with Arkham combat and Lord of the Rings lore. If you enjoy playing those games and the Lord of the Rings story, then you will feel right at home with this game. It's really fun to exploit the uruks system, and it really is what makes the game. There is a lot of variety in the uruks, and they all have their unique personality and looks, adding hours to the gameplay. Overall the game is short, easily completed in around 3 days to 100%, and that is the one thing that sets this game back for me from being a masterpiece - I just would have loved to see more content."
MadFaker,"Nov 1, 2015",9,"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is freaking aweosme. It goes back to the roots of why video games are made: for fun. It has a great combat system, equally entertaining and challenging. Visuals are great. Fantastic gameplay. Story, uhmmm, I could say between average and above average range. The system with the captains and war chiefs is great and hell of a fun for me. Overall would highly recommend this game."
chr1so,"Oct 29, 2015",9,"Really fun game and hard to put down. The combat system is amazing and is the main focus of the game. It's a mix of Batman's & Assassin's Creed's systems. Just really fluid, responsive and challenging, especially when Captains and War Chiefs are involved.
It's really well paced and a perfect length. Would highly recommend"
fallouts,"Oct 27, 2015",9,"Shadow of Mordor is an insanely fun open world action stealth game, and sets a great example of how AC games ought to be. There are no shallow missions to distract from the experience, no tailing anyone, it's just you and the entire open world with sandbox missions at your disposal. Go about how you like and the game rewards you for it, be it satisfying stealth kills or battle finishers. The side activities are also very fun. This is a must and GOTY for 2014, right behind Dragon Age Inquisition."

thausael,"Oct 11, 2015",9,"That's the breath which we seek for long time. LOTR games are generally **** ass, but this particular game is very good with all of its aspects. Story and progression is the weakest link and hanging slightly above average."
Davidscj,"Oct 9, 2015",9,"Shadow of Mordor is a sublime game that combines hard difficulty with fantastic gameplay along with a story that will please all Lord of the rings fans and gamers alike.

The first thing that stands out about tis game is its difficulty at the beginning. It is perhaps too much and overwhelming. Thankfully this is quickly, if not quick enough, overcome through character progression. There are times when it seems unfairly hard out-with the progression mechanic, sometimes being surrounded by too many captains for no explicable reason (at one point I was surrounded by 4 captains just trying to free one slave). But at the end of the game success feel all the sweeter due to the games difficulty.

My biggest problem with the game was the respond rate of enemies. At times it was ridiculous. At times I could see enemies responding around me in areas I had just cleared out, this a slow tactical approach for me at certain times. his was especially true at the beginning as you move through the world slower and more cautiously. The long term effect of this is that you don't feel like you are impacting the world, not even a small corner as all enemies will return so quickly. This is only natural due to the setting, Mordor, yet is unsatisfying mechanically. What it lacks is the taking over of areas, an expected mechanic of open world games. However implementation of tis could cause different issues.

The world feels small and that is an issue. You lots of tasks in the same areas/strongholds and that c be tedious especially with refreshing enemies (Differs greatly to a game such as dragon age inquisition). On the topic of the world, the environment lacks variety. This naturally is the nature of being in the shadow of mordor and it is fixed slightly in second half but I still feel like more could have been done visually in the areas to differentiate each area of the map.

The much hyped nemesis system is simply fantastic. It is true innovation. Enough people have talked about how it works that theres no need to cover this, the most surprising thing is that it just works so well. Through the nemesis system the world feels connected and living. This is where impact on the world comes in. It can become a fantastic distraction from the main plot that can devour whole evenings of your time. It is very exciting to see future applications of this system. Getting the ability to control enemies changes the game and the nemesis system completely at the right time. The game just gets better and better.

The story is fantastic. The characters are fitted into the known lore nicely. And the lore is slightly altered to great effect. The story is paced superbly and truly gets to an epic peak fitting of the license. Old characters such as Gollum are fantastic and new characters, Torvin especially, are great.

The game boasts some excellent side missions, particularly the weapon related missions. However freeing slaves becomes too repetitive. Added to this is a good range of collectibles scattered across the map. Unlike some games the volume of collectibles is perfect and not too overwhelming. They add story and aid progression nicely. However the pay off for 100% collection is pretty poor.

At the core of the game is excellent gameplay. The combat is excellent. It is fluid and weighty and as mentioned difficult. There is great progression eventually from weak to strong. There are great abilities to unlock that add depth to combat and new ways to approach it and thankfully the AI is fairly strong. One issue is that climbing may be too powerful. Enemies lack anywhere near the same level of climbing or manoeuvrability. This makes escape easy and height a great advantage. They generally resort to trying to make you fall rather than follow Games like Assassins Creed have overcome this issue with mobile enemies and this is lacking here. Otherwise the combat is pretty flawless.

This is simply a fantastic game once you get some progression and adjust to the difficulty. A must play."
Gwyndolin,"Sep 16, 2015",8,"Despite of having little experience of Batman games, and not a diehard LoTR fan, I found the game to be enjoyable. The Nemesis system is new and kept things interesting. The combat is simple, but it won't get repetitive too quickly. The world is not that big but has enough to keep me busy for awhile. The stealth mechanics were decent but I feel the game design really encouraged more straight up combat, which is a shame as combat really do get stale after 15 hours or so.
It was definitely a good experience, and I am glad for the LOTR fans out there that there's a game like this out there for them.
As far as story goes, it is extremely simple but a revenge story usually is straightforward. The last boss fight was kind of a letdown though.

If you are not a LoTR fan, rent it or buy it at sales price. If you are, it is a must play."
bulletchan,"Sep 9, 2015",8,"from the minute i put this magic disk in, the game flowed with story, passion, and blood. if you like killing games here ya go. if you like extremely well made fighting, here you go. this is its own game can not be compared to others."
Glenaldo,"Sep 8, 2015",6,"Something's missing. This game is all about combat and it's very repetitive. It's not bad but I got tired really quick (didn't finish). Also, reading other reviews made me think graphics were incredible. They are not."
NexxeR,"Sep 1, 2015",8,"Great LOTR presentation, Great visuals, Ok story, game very repetitive.

Vast open world to explore, side missions galore that will take you off of the main story path.
At some point the repetitiveness caused me to stop playing and look at other things. might come back to finish it in the future.
Visuals are great.. presentation does great job of welcoming you back to middle earth..."

rhysmyself,"Aug 18, 2015",8,Great all rounder. Combat felt repetitive (although mechanically very good) and upgrade system felt lacking towards the end of the (relatively short) campaign. BUT as a fan of Middle Earth was pretty engaged from start to finish.  Good time to pick it up pre owned.
MrXhedo,"Aug 11, 2015",9,"This game borrows some concepts from other games and gets the best out of them, with a satisfying progression system, beautiful graphics, a unique and entertaining Nemesis system and responsive combat. Make one of the most satisfying and must play games of this generation."
ConorIrwin001,"Aug 9, 2015",8,"As a big fan of the Lord of the Rings universe I had high hopes for this game on announcement and largely they have remained intact. The beautiful combat system which draws primarily on Arkham Asylum's revolutionary fluidity and an increase of freedom of movement through a variety of skills ensures that it looks and plays beautifully. The character progression is spot on, and in the late -game environment I felt both incredibly powerful but also very aware that I could still be challenged in the form of the larger Uruk strongholds. The main fault of Shadow of Mordor is its story which appeared to be hard to invest in, and despite drawing on a variety of LOTR lore, I couldn't shake the feeling that more could have been done in this regard. Overall, a fun and worthwhile game that deserves your time."
amcorne1,"Jul 31, 2015",8,I'm so mixed about this game. I really do like the game but they could have made it a little easier in my opinion.  The nemesis system is so cool but I wish it didn't make life so hard. Its such a turn off when your beating down your target and another captain or an insane amount of urks come just cannot hold them off. Another huge problem is captains magically surviving after you kill them. I have watched all the IGN videos and the guys playing make it look so much easier than it is. Even following their advice its is extremely difficult. I play for enjoyment and I am not an all out gamer but this game puts me on the edge of frustration that makes it not really worth playing. For the hardcore gamer who is devoted to conquering every aspect this is **** the average **** so much.
pwills2009,"Jul 29, 2015",7,"Game play was fun. Most enjoyable abilities were only able to be acquired near the end of the game, however. The final two boss battles were TERRIBLE. One included no fighting, just sequential button pushing. I liked the game, but the last hour of game play was overwhelmingly disappointing."
saif99,"Jul 28, 2015",7,"as an obsessed person with middle earth movies, i was really excited for this game, and i can't say i was quite disappointed but it's just that i expected **** story is good but how the game ends was disappointing actually, but the gameplay is really enjoyable and that what gives the game all the positive reviews"
odahima,"Jul 23, 2015",7,"It is a good game only if you  didn't play other games because this is nothing but stealing from batman, assassin's creed, other good games combined with stupid mechanics and poor story. You just keep pressing square to attack and triangle to counter-attack and that is very much the whole game. The critics' rating was very misleading and I regret ever buying it."
Lazlo21,"Jul 17, 2015",9,"Middle earth: shadow of mordor is a damn good game. I enjoyed every second of playing it (on PS4).

The gameplay is a mix between the batman arkham games, and the assassin's creed games. The combat is derived from the arkham side. You can slash, counter, and perform brutal finishing moves in your Orc enemies. Those finishers, for me, never get old. The movement is where the assassin's creed portion comes in. The way talion climbs and free runs feels just like AC. In other words, the gameplay is amazing.

The main feature that shadow of mordor introduces is the nemesis system. It contains of an entire hierarchy of orcs, all constantly battling for higher positions of power. Every time you die by the hands of a captain, they get promoted, amongst other orcs across mordor receiving titles. Another feature introduced is the ability to brand orcs. This means that you brainwash them, and insert them back into the regular Orc society. So if you brand a captain, you can help him rise up to power, and manipulate events within the hierarchy of orcs.

The story is also great. It follows talion, who was killed by sauron, being ressurected by a wraith, and setting off on his quest for vengeance, along the way, you meet a few familiar faces from the LOTR books and movies, along with many interesting new characters. Most missions involve taking on different tasks, with much variety in gameplay and mission objectives. Although, the final boss battle is EXTREMELY anticlimactic.

This may be my favorite game on the PS4 so far. I love it, and would play it again, anyday. 9/10"
Jollukka1,"Jul 10, 2015",8,"Shadow of Mordor: stylish combat, epic fighting and well-created enemies are salt of the game. Shadow of Mordor is the best action/adventure game of 2014. // 8 points"
Thomabaddon,"Jul 1, 2015",8,Good game. a potpurri of proven combat mechanics with a poor and uninspired story. Slashing orcs is really satisfying but it gets boring after a while.
gramwgre,"Jun 11, 2015",9,"Loads of fun contained in a really good looking, open world. Very interesting enemy system, with Captians leveling up and planning revenges. Got about 60 hours of gameplay out of it and enjoyed every second."
TuttiTooFruity,"Jun 5, 2015",8,"After seeing gameplay for this I was definitely determined to get it while on special.
At first I loved it, the combat is a lot of fun and it's not too easy or difficult. As you upgrade to get new abilities, combat gets even better. However it does get quite repetitive and the story doesn't grab at you, levelling up is very linear and there isn't really any customization.
There are unique things about the game that do make it appealing, but the game didn't satisfy for long. I bought the premium edition and I haven't even bothered to finish the game or the expansions because it is so repetitive.
But overall if you can get this game on special below $80 for the full game with expansions, I would recommend it."
Animator97,"Jun 4, 2015",8,"If you like sword action games. If you like games that are extremely fun. If you love the Lord of the Rings lore. You have found your correct game. This Is not your ordinary slasher. It is a unique game style with great story, setting, lore and gameplay. If the one thing you love about games are boss fights, then you should play this game and Bloodborne. Warner Brothers, as, always, has injected there unique style into
this game. It has the smoothest gameplay and the smartest AI. Great game. The world is so unique and real. The game also has that unique hand drawn style that is so rare anymore, to see a game that looks like a game. A game that had a lot of work put into it. One of the very few games that feel next gen."
Dartek,"Jun 4, 2015",9,"I finish the complete game with DLC included, maybe the problem is that the fights are repetitive but anyway good looking and challenging and the way you go trough the story is lineal but anyway you love the character, great graphics and some enemies are a real deal but you will have a lot of fun fighting 10 orcs at the same time."
K5000i,"Jun 3, 2015",8,"well this was my 1st ps4 game & it was a good intro into the new system, cant say it was a very long game as blast through it within 2 weeks ,.,, but i did have a great time with it. very much as mix of assassin's creed  & batman ,., but light on story ,., still chasing down the orcs was a story on its own :) not too much replay value , but it is open ended for a pick up & play at any time so well worth the £25 paid for it"
PuffyPufferFish,"Jun 1, 2015",9,"Shadow of  Mordor is an amazing piece artwork with few flaws.

Positives +
Amazing skills/skill tree with interesting and fun skills
Second island has amazing terrain
Amazing graphics
Fun enjoyable missions
Great Characters

Negatives -

1st island kind of flat and boring
missions could have more variety

This game is so much fun and so addicting if you don't already have it go and get it!"
buggy226,"May 30, 2015",9,"In my opinion, this game was the best game of the year.

The flaws in this game are: occasional control issues when hanging from ledges; rare graphical errors; and a complete misunderstanding of a few aspects of the lore in sections of the menus.

The good points about the game are: the game looks good, controls are responsive and accurate, both combat and stealth are viable options, and there is a decent story.

The best thing about the game is the nemesis system.  You can raise a level 1 orc to a level 20 warchief, just by allowing him to kill you, and defeating his superiors.  Enemies that you have defeated may return with horrible scars and a thirst for revenge.  Enemies that you face more than once will remember your previous encounter and comment on it."

HenriqueV,"May 17, 2015",6,"2014 was a quite year for video gaming. You realize that when Shadow of Mordor get many game of the year awards.

Its only a okay game. Combat is fun, but the game is really repetitive. Some missions is only about collecting herbs and following a specific character to point 1 to point 2.

Story is really weak. As a Tolkien fan, I can't get Celebrinbor playing as a goodguyspectre in this game, it just doesn't make any kind of sense. Main character Talion feels generic. Gollum is completely out of place. Scenario is uninspiring and incredible repetitive.

I mean, I played this one in 2015, in a moment that PS4 launch window include games like Bloodborne, Project Cars, Witcher 3 and Arkham Knight, its really hard to care about a game like this. Just a little better than mediocre."
L_Coops,"May 17, 2015",8,"The full potential of this game was not realized. Despite that, it's still good fun.

A few things annoyed me with Shadow of Mordor:
- The game starts off too hard but then becomes far too easy once you unlock a few of your better abilities
- The nemesis system could have been so much more with a little extra depth
- The final boss battle is very underwhelming
- The story is uninspired

Overall though, it's still a great game. It has very satisfying combat mechanics, the nemesis system is engaging and satisfying and the graphics are pretty. It's just lacking some much needed depth to boost it to a 9/10 or even 10/10 game."
Gamedetector,"May 11, 2015",7,"Nemesis system is great, the graphics are nice, they do not bother at all, tasks, war is fun, but the scenario is boring. The game does not have a decent boss battle. Especially the last boss is a complete disgrace."
Ghoster,"May 10, 2015",10,"Didn't expect much from this game because I'm not really fan of genre. Story is good but nothing special, but gameplay is what make this game awesome.

There are few things which could be improved, but in luck of good games lately it deserve 10+ !!!"

DSouls_guy,"Apr 30, 2015",10,"Wow, why didn't I play this sooner. At first I wasn't sure if shadow of Mordor was a good purchase, but all that doubt went to rest when I started playing this adventure. The graphics, music, combat, voice acting is all amazing. The story is well written as well, there are a few problems in shadow of Mordor some times the frame rate can get jumpy but nothing game breaking. Over all this is the best action RPG game to be on the ps4 besides bloodborne."

If your going to spend a million dollars to produce a game give it a story to **** story like the last of us or fallout not this running around with a sword god of war crap. Nobody want to play the same fight scene over and over! MY MONEY BACK PLEASE?
notlaw,"Apr 7, 2015",9,"A game worth playing, Shadow of mordor is a great follow up to the last lotr game. its mechanics do feel like a cross over between assassins creed and batman leaning a little closer to batman and in no way is that a bad thing. the battles when you are fighting hoards of uruks are epic and is has a decent story to it as well, My only peevs with the game are that the boss battles with the tower and the others were to easy the parkour could have been abit better hear and there like instead of jumping to a ledge thats across from me talion would do a massive jump to the ground and a bigger area would have made this perfect in my book."
Kondorp96,"Apr 6, 2015",9,"This game is very well crafted, i enjoyed playing this game for hours on end, the nemesis system is a very cool concept, any random grunt that gets lucky enough to kill you, gets promoted to a captain and gets a name, so it adds a sense of personality to the normally nameless NPCs in other games, i really rather like that! the camera can be annoying at times but for the most part it hasn't bothered me. I've logged quite a few hours into this game and i have not found anything that i don't like. the graphics are pretty nice, but they are not the pinnacle of next gen consoles, i'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the lord of the ring movies, and enjoy the story. because it wasn't there for me, I've never watched any of those films, maybe other than the hobbit, but that didn't make me dislike playing, it just made me feel like i didn't quite understand exactly what was going on, or who this new talking NPC was. it made me feel a little out of place, but not enough to bring my rating to anything under a 9"

LordMacBeth22,"Mar 26, 2015",10,"Huge LotR Fan, and this game nailed it.  After completing it once, I went back to play it a second time through.  Knowing how to better use the abilities made for more enjoyment.  The main quest thread is well written and keeps you guessing.  Hours and hours of worth wild game time.  Enemies will pop up that supposedly bested one of your online friends (unconfirmed).  The only possible downside is that the same ‘challenges’ pop up (over and over) but with different enemies who have different Strengths/Weaknesses which forces you to not use the same killing moves.

By far the most enjoyable PS4 game I have played to date.  Give it a try, if you don’t enjoy it trade it in."

edwardashton07,"Mar 20, 2015",9,Great game. The amount of the detail is astonishing and the way that the story is set out is incredible. It's a bit like Assassins Creed though. I'm a massive fan of Assassins Creed but this game looks like it could match to how much I like Assassins Creed.
Confo,"Mar 17, 2015",8,"One of the best gameplays and mechanics I have experienced in a game. Its a Middle-Earth game that every fan deserved. it gives you emotion, excitement combating with tons and tons of Uruks."
AbominationV,"Mar 16, 2015",10,"Simply, AMAZING definitely the best game I have played in the whole of 2014 and with so many disappointing games in 2014 this game really did take the cake, from the game play to the graphics, it may not be the best looking game but damn it looks good, especially when it's raining and water falls onto Talion's outfit, it looks really stunning not to mention easily the best part of this game for me, the Nemesis System, it allows players to create a story of their own with battles against Captains-Warchiefs being both extremely challenging at times but always a blast. Simply put this game is a must buy for fans of the Batman Arkham games and or the Assassin's Creed games."
SuperAC,"Mar 16, 2015",5,"Extremely fun combat and story but the rate at which enemies spawn completely ruins the games, it's no fun taking on a captain and then all of a sudden have a group of orcs and other captains spawn from absolutely nowhere resulting in you dying instantly. Good idea, poor execusion"
tormentor55,"Mar 14, 2015",9,"Just buy this game. As a LOTR this game is awesome. As an assassin's creed fan, this game is awesome. As a Batman Arkahm fan, this game is awesome. It has the combat of Arkahm and the parkour/exploration of Assassin's creed. Why is this game not called rip-off of the year you may ask? That's because it adds a little something  to the table that propels it beyond AC Unity and gives it's identity. The Nemesis system. It allows for dynamic relations with you and the baddies and makes this game 'Next-gen' for gameplay AND graphics. The story is ok but what makes it so great is the fact that you can LITERALLY make a story of your own by tampering with the orcs around you and just having a good time. Shadow of Mordor second next-gen game that truly shows what these new consoles can do. (First being Battlefield 4.)"
masonthemofo,"Mar 10, 2015",9,you might say this game stole from: batman or assassin's creed. but it's okay because this game is more a assassin's creed game then assassin's creed is. and the combat is phenomenal. this game is a hidden gem and i hope a lot of people find it. P.S. there are no lore breaking moments
DMD,"Mar 10, 2015",5,"I wonder if all the positive reviews played the same game I did. I don't deny it has its fun moments, and it has wonderful graphics and sound, but there are so many negatives that I only play the game now in short bursts.

-Bow is underpowered, designed mostly to shoot down the middle-earth equivalent of exploding barrels.
-Talion's default walk is very slow, so you're constantly holding X down to dash. If in stealth, r2 and X.
-Pointless grinding for upgrades that aren't all that useful.
-bad combat. hit o to stun, x x x x, hit triangle to counter. If there are more than two bosses, run away.
-TOO MANY ENEMIES. 20-30 normal orcs, and up to 5 bosses weren't all that uncommon. You can sometimes use stealth to thin the odds, but that's only for some missions; in the open world, it felt like most of the time you'd race to kill the boss before more linked.

There were more issues, but the game felt grindy and unfun. The cool little Gollum missions and moments like riding a catagor seemed few and far between, as opposed to walking from point a to point B trying to kill an endless supply of respawning orcs who taunt you if they kill you. And those boss orcs are either randomly easy (die to a single headshot, can be stealth killed) or resist everything (can't be stunned, can't be flipped over, invulnerable to ranged attacks...) It's a gorgeous game, but not one I can play in long spurts without getting annoyed at."
Muzzle131,"Mar 9, 2015",9,"So off the bat: This game is good. We could leave it that but I'm not that type of person so first off is the story: For me it's the weakest part, I'm no giant fan of Lord of the Rings so I have only a simple idea of whats going on which is you are Talion a man who is part of band of other soldiers called hunters who are the first defense against the Sauron's return, however a siege on the gates takes place and you are captured and killed making you an undead unable to live or die, now it's up to you and your Wraith companion to seek vengeance. So simply put it's a vengeance story and it doesn't (seem) to greatly impact anything of the over-arching story so you would probably come here only for gameplay. The gameplay is a bit of a touchy subject, it's like Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham , you stealth around finding ways to slice an enemy and combat is your simple attack and counter attack, simple right? WRONG! The combat at least is super difficult creating situations of intense focus as it punishes you for any wrong move you do. That being said it's a good thing creating something of a Dark Souls feel where you have to quickly assess a situation and execute a plan, in the first hours of the game it's pretty difficult as your entirely weak and helpless using intelligence and the environment to your advantage against the most unrelenting Uruks. Which I should mention is probably the greatest reason on this games success: normal Uruks are nothing special except they do seem to have intelligent AI that know that ganging up on you is the best way to kill you, but it's the captains that take the cake as each one of them has a unique name and personality that constantly evolve as they level up making combat more intense if one joins in. They also serve as a vital role within game as the nemesis system works against you and is always in motion, for instance captains will try to complete their own challenges in order to level up and become that much more powerful making you want to intervene and instead you level up, which is another thing: leveling up does make you stronger however it becomes that more clear that it still wont stop the local population to pave the road in your blood as a simple 1 v 5 can turn into a much more **** of what is going on!? Like the Neo vs Smith fight in Matrix: Reloaded and probably ending up the same way and that is: you running like hell. In the end this is a solid amazing game creating lots of fun and replay value thanks to the nemesis system."
RobertoAmigo,"Mar 5, 2015",9,"This game is different than the games I usually play. What I like about is are the fighting mechanisms. Slaying orcs becomes a great experience and when you improve your skills you will find out that you get stronger every time. I recommend to do the side missions and collectables as well. With these missions you can get many ability points to improve your character. You can go on and rush the game, but you wouldnt get the whole experience and you'll find out that improving your character takes much longer.

The graphics are very nice as well, and all the orc captains and warchiefs have unique personalities and appearance which give you the impression you're not fighting the same enemy over and over. Also the Nemesis system works great. The only downside of this system is that you can't skip the changes when orcs are getting promoted or new orcs become captain. After several times you know how the system works and it's not necessary to be forced to watch every change in the Nemesis System.

Overall this game has a good story and it feels good to walk around in Mordor. Also the return of a specific character (not going to spoil this one) is very nice and gives you the impression you are one of the characters who actually lived in Middle Earth."

tiagodantas,"Feb 24, 2015",4,"Super repetitive! There are not another words to describe this game. You have to be a super patient person to complete it. Even for a Lord of The Rings based game, is dispensable."
thegadfly44,"Feb 24, 2015",8,"This game is awesome. That's as simple as it can be put. The Nemesis system is phenomenal and provides a very welcome challenge and innovation to an industry that's been severely lacking in both. It's a beautiful game with a compelling story and is a crap load of fun to play.

This game would have been a nine except I can't forgive the final boss battle. For a game that goes out of it's way to be challenging in a whole new unique way, is was a HUGE let down and disappointment that the final boss was a quick time event. And not even a good one at that. I spent a lot of time and energy in building my character up to have all these skills and abilities, and for what? Just to continue playing against war cheifs and captains? That is fun and all but the final point is so that my character would be strong enough to face the final boss. I mean that's the point right? This was a stupid and lackluster mistake on their end. Also, the season pass feels like a huge waste of money, don't bother.

Other than that and a few glitches that were annoying but not game breaking, AWESOME AWESOME GAME AND A MUST PLAY."
EsvaDark,"Feb 22, 2015",9,"Definitely one of the best game i've played on the PS4. Excellent graphics and amazing combat system definitely want to do execution over and over again. The nemesis system offer new experience too. I  had a captain who came from the dead up to two times before i slayed him for eternity and i feel like he was a best friend for me, such a memorable moment. The only drawback on this game is short mission and final boss battle that were too easy."

LadiesMan217,"Feb 19, 2015",9,"I'm giving it a solid 9. If you hate sandbox, Asassin's Creed-style games you may not like this one. However, the fighting style, super creative enemies, gripping story and jaw-dropping graphical quality merit a high score. It's a game that sorta creeps on you. The beginning of the story pits you right in the middle of middle-earth. While it'd be cool to see some hobbits and the combat is a wee bit confusing off the bat, you soon get used to it and virtually immersed in the amazing world the designers built. Word of warning, don't do as I did and get whooped repeatedly early in the game. If you do, you'll find yourself battling level 20 dudes that are nay impossible to defeat without a lot of luck.

Some of the battles in this game feel ripped right out of a movie scene, with baddies teaming up and talking ork-crap to each other and you. It's great."
Abdulbaqr,"Feb 17, 2015",10,"Very stable game, incredibly good combat system. Only thing that bugged me was that I spent a LARGE amount of time crouched down so that i wouldn't accidentally alert one of the millions of baddies roaming around.

lggregorio,"Feb 17, 2015",8,"A very nice game with fun missions and history, I believe this is one of the best games I have played in the last years and trully stands up to the hype. I am giving 8 because it can be really frustrating at the beginning until you find what you have to do and where you should go. The fighting can get boring after some time, all captains work the same way: you find them, tons of enemies appear out of nowhere and you have to find a way to get rid of the mess."
kenmil,"Feb 15, 2015",7,"A strange thing happened to me whilst playing this game - I got bored with it after playing about 75%. This has never happened before and I always play to the end, but this one just lost me. Sure there are some weaknesses, such as a weapon upgrade rune system that keeps rewarding me with useless runes way below my current level, and an inability to keep my character focused on the opponent during combat, but I think it was the repetition in every location and every quest that finally drained me of any interest.
The graphics are very nice though."
Krawbeard,"Feb 14, 2015",8,"Take all the good mechanics of assassins creed and batman arkham city, then put in a nemesis system... and a lil spice of well polished graphics and you have **** lord of the rings style game.

Is it the greatest game ever?  no!

But however it is an awesome stand alone single player title that will keep you entertained for hours to come.

The game isn't lacking in any way so I would say I am happy they didn't chop this game and sell the rest as DLC like most games that have been coming out lately.  The DLC feels like an option for if you really love this game and want more rather than.. ""hey you wont enjoy this game until you fork over money for the season pass"".  With that I may buy the DLC once I have beaten the game.

I can truly get lost playing this game.
There are a few bugs in the game like where Celembrimdors spirit will stay frozen in spots you left wraith mode but its not game breaking.

There are quick time events however it doesn't take away any immersion what so ever like a lot of quick time events do.

Its definitely one of the better games out and I believe if you buy this game which you can find $40-$50 deals at best buy and the internet then you can be assured your money was well spent on an entertaining fun game.

The story is interesting but honestly I just love the gameplay.  you have free roam to go wherever and the scenery in the game changes as you progress.  Grinding for upgrades is minimal and the side missions aren't dragged out and boring like assassins creed.

If you get this game I would recommend upgrading your elf shot as much as you can and your wraith abilities because you will use it a lot and will be most helpful.

The game is very rewarding and yet not too challenging.  you can't go hacking and slashing in a fight expecting to button mash your way through.  it takes some combat strategy much like batman arkham city.  The side missions make it rewarding to complete as you find new runes to play with the customize your ranger/wraith the way you want him to fight.  which is very unique... some runes can be burned to upgrade quicker.

All in all i feel like the game catches up with my skill level to where its not too easy to where i can get bored easily.

I enjoy having that feeling of revenge if an uruk kills me and I see him get promoted, then i go stalk him and hunt him down or I possess him so i can use him as my puppet to get me a big uruk army.  Sometimes i just let an uruk kill me just to watch the events unfold for him.

My only disappointment (SPOILER SCROLL DOWN) is they killed off my favorite character Ratbag the Coward early in the game.  Was feeling attached to the little guy.

There are also some moments that get annoying like trying to get talion to hang on one side of the wall then hangs on the opposite side where the uruks are however it still isn't game breaking.

I do wish they would've gotten deeper into the hunting.

However I will say this.. If you are curious about this game and you love assassins creed and the batman games then this will be for you.  Its one of the better games out there and monolith/WB did a great job releasing a game that feels like you got your money's worth. GREAT JOB."
bfgallo,"Feb 12, 2015",6,"Great inovative game but has its problems:

- sometimes you get too many enemys on screen/ makes strategy combat impossible.
- camera issues.
- boss presentation interrupts fight everytime."
Ocosu,"Feb 11, 2015",7,"What to say about this game... My rating was tricky. I honestly loved the game and it's gameplay. What brought down my score as much as it did was the fact the game's actual story was so short. On top of that, the last two 'bosses' was very disheartening for me. The first boss was actually challenging and was fun to play against... The second boss? It felt like a child's game of hide&seek, with the final boss? You don't even get to do anything but watch. For a game I had considered to be as good as it was before that, it was sad to say the least.

I understand there is a lot of content to game in terms of side missions and quests you can do. I'm not by any means saying it lacks in content. What I am saying though is the actual story ended up lacking. Way to short for my liking.

I'd still recommend this game. If you like exploring areas, getting really involved in it's awesome side missions and quest, this is the game for you. Great fighting system... Great systems in general. If you're someone who doesn't often bother in side quest stuff and just want a nice story mode? I can't say this will provide that. It didn't exactly for me. It has a cliffhanger ending which is nice and all since I would actually buy a sequel to this game... But I just hold they go further with the story and don't make it as brief as they did in this one.

Overall, good game."
LumacJax,"Feb 10, 2015",8,"the gameplay is very enjoyable and the nemesis system is very good, but can be repetitive. We are really closes to assassin's creed about the conception: Reach towers to synchronize the area, sneaky mission and huge fight when you are detected. During the fight, you push the attack button until someone attack you back. And icon will pop-up (Usually, the triangle for PS4) and you will block.

The game is fluid, even when you have 20-30 enemies around you.

The video of introduction is breathtaking!"
avirius,"Feb 10, 2015",2,"This game is like so many other pretty things: it looks nice but that's the only good thing you can say.

The Controls)

The controls for this game are without doubt the most atrocious, ill-conceived random mishmash of nonsense that I have ever seen in a game.  Button definitions are contextual, nothing new there, but the context changes so often that there is no way to memorize the controls.  The Square attacks, but if you hold down the stealth and tap some other button then it drops down from a ledge.  I count 15 button type controls on my PS4 stick, not counting the system control/option buttons.  As a game designer, if you have to resort to 3 button combinations to achieve your goals then you need to step back and reconsider your mappings and whether this game is really going to be playable.

I can't stress this enough.  This game is so complicated to play that I just eject the disc after 10 minutes or so and put it away for another month hopping it will improve with age.  It doesn't.

The Gameplay)

Poor control layout aside, the game does look very nice which just serves to antagonize me since I know I will never see very much of it.  So far, I have seen Orcs, slaves, and some cat-like thing.  The Orcs are easy enough to fight in 1s and 2s but they tend to come in packs once you get them riled up.  Good luck there.  My ranger gets beaten nearly to death (probably since I can't remember to R1+tap R2 while pressing X or some nonsense) and then the game pauses momentarily to give me some chance to do something.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do but it draws a circle on the screen and puts an arrow and I think it wants me to do something with the left or right stick.  Who knows.  I see that a lot and it's my warning that I'm going to die in about 5 seconds.  Time to get a sandwich and wait for the silly Nemesis system to promote and Orc.  I read a lot about what a wonderful thing the nemesis system is.  Maybe, but I see a lot of Orcs getting promoted (read more powerful) and I don't seem to be getting any better with these game mechanics.

The camera and the stealth (and the camera while stealthed) are also troubling.  The camera wants to re-center as I move and I find myself constantly fighting with he right stick.  This has the effect of making the movement a little sickening around corners and it makes the game feel numb.  That's a shame but wouldn't keep me from playing the game.

Stealth is darned handy but darned difficult to maintain.  You have to hold down a button constantly to stealth.  Wow, who thought that was a good idea.  Stealth is a necessity in this game since the wild array of randomly assigned controls is useless, kills mostly come from sneaking up on something and hitting it.  So I stealth a lot.  However, to stay stealthed, you must hold down R2 (I think it's R2) all the time.  That's amazing, though in a very bad way.

The Story)

Honestly, I can't say much about the story.  I can't get far enough into the game to really know if there is a story or not.  I'm playing in Story Mode, though I don't know if there is a free exploration mode or not.  Regardless, all I have seen are Orcs, slaves, and cat-like things.

Conclusion)

I've played games with marginal graphics and great controls that were fun but I can't say that I have ever played a game with great graphics and poor controls that was anything but a waste of money and time.  Shadow of Mordor is a fine example of a pretty game with ill-thought, poorly implemented controls.

Don't waste your time or your money unless your idea of a fun game is figuring out esoteric controls that are nearly impossible to remember and require vast dexterity (think hold down two buttons while tapping a third)."
angrywombat,"Feb 10, 2015",5,"About halfway through the game I felt I had done everything is has to offer. It's fun to be a ranger/wraith running around middle earth killing orcs for a while.... but the story is uninspired, and the game-play gets repetitive fast. Reminds me very much of Assassin's Creed with a new skin. I'd only recommend this if it's in the bargain bin."
Slappyjigg,"Feb 9, 2015",9,"Tons of fun. Combat is great and very **** developers made it very easy for you to feel like a complete badass in combat. The nemesis system is fun and honestly drags me away from the main campaign, seeing as how I want to either avenge my death or the death of a friend, or eliminate another captain/settle a dispute/spoil a feast lol. It's just so enjoyable! And the voice acting! You know you get anxious when a game is announced with full voice acting, seeing as how most voice acting is awkward, if not horrid at best. The acting, voice work, character movement (I'm assuming motion capture) and just everything else is so polished and well thought out. You can tell they took care and wanted the smallest aspects of their game to really shine on their own. Even though the story line doesn't necessarily fall exactly in line with the Lord of the Rings story, it does an excellent job of interweaving it into their tale, and more importantly is convincing. Whatever your reservations about the game are, throw them in the pool and play **** better yet, buy it!"
rodericrinehart,"Feb 7, 2015",9,"Yes, it is a mix of Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham Asylum, and maybe even Tomb Raider,, but it is better than all of those games, AND it adds the Nemesis system, which is definitely going to be copied by many games in the future.

Shadow of Mordor has excellent parkour, sweet graphics, truly interesting and story-drive collectibles, and really good and varied combat. The combat of Assassin's Creed is absolutely horrible in comparison.

They have a gem on their hands here. I thoroughly enjoyed myself from start to finish and will eagerly pre-order the next game in the franchise!"
JayLightBar,"Feb 6, 2015",7,"This game is great! There is a lot of fun to be had in the slashing and murdering of nasty old **** that ruined the life of our main hero. Not only does the game look beautiful on the ps4, but it runs just perfectly. Never had a single drop in frame rate through my entire playthrough. There's a lot to do here, and well keep you busy. The story itself wasn't terrible...until the last few moments, which completely ruined the 3RD Act of the game for me. Sound design is good, nothing really that great though. No song from here well be remembered. Overall, it's fun. Shadows of Murder could very well be the first step into a great game series. But next time, step it up in the story department please."
alexmanea,"Feb 5, 2015",9,"This game is simply awesome! I was skeptical at first because of the other LOTR games but I was surprised by how good this game can be. The graphics were beautiful and the story just hypnotises you with its amazing plot. I loved the fact that it combined elements from both Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham. Even the side quests were fun to play but after a while these can get a little repetitive. Another reason why I love this game so much is because it is fun and enjoyable. Also, I've achieved near 80% of the trophies not even trying to achieve them, but only by beating the game 100% ."
masterjohnson1,"Feb 5, 2015",10,"What a game, running through mordor Killing hordes of orc's and urak's. The skills and runes you get are amazing and the kill animations when you kill a war chief or captain are just the best in any game to date.
This is one of the best games in 2014 if you have not tried it you should, you will not regret it"
Dokkodo,"Feb 5, 2015",8,"This game blatantly rips off AC2 and the Arkham Games and it is so damn fun that you won't care. Sure it might steal a lot of it's mechanics but it also implements new ones and makes it really fun.

The combat is fun and from start to finish you are pretty much engaged in it. There isn't a whole lot of waiting for something to happen, even when you're traveling from point A to point B you are probably going to get tempted by that small patrol waiting to get their throats cut.

The biggest downside is that the game is pretty short, you can easily finish it in a day. If you want a challenge you basically have to create your own challenge because the story mode isn't going to give you one, but you can play with the generals to boost their power and make them a threat.

I also found the story more interesting than those boring long-winded movies, that Gollum thing annoys the piss out of me though."
Taltos,"Feb 3, 2015",9,"Great fun.
Interesting story, but the combat or kill sections are a blast.
Yes it is a bit repetitive in places but overall a great game to spend a few days with."
Hank704,"Feb 2, 2015",5,"I'm almost sorry to give this game this score because the first half was amazing, but the 3rd act of the game will leave you with a terrible taste in your mouth. Its starts out fantastic and challenging, but the ending of the game was obviously rushed and included quick time event boss fights. A game that should pride itself on finding the weaknesses of your opponent and then engaging them in combat ends up having a quick time event for the final bosses! What!?
The only thing else I can say is that you will put effort into the game because the beginning makes it seem like it has so much potential, but you will soon see (and by soon I mean SOON! Really Short Main Campaign) that your effort will reap no rewards or lasting feel of accomplishment."
Rymac44,"Jan 30, 2015",9,"Really good game. The nemesis system is great, as is the gameplay itself. The plot isn't anything amazing, but is interesting enough, although the ending isn't very good. Only other complaint is the camera angle which can get very annoying . Even still, it's a very fun game with cool customization options such as skills and weapon ruins."
Dionysus777,"Jan 27, 2015",8,This is my least favorite type of game. I cant stand assassins creed with its mindless systematic gameplay  and simple challengeless mechanics. That being said this is what assassins creed would be if it were good. Graphics are all right. Orc models look great.Nemesis system adds replay.Combat  is good but its kind of convaluted and doesnt present much challenge. I like lor but dont care about the story in this. Just to honest  though dont really care about the story in the movies either i just like the epic scale and visuals. This is a good game overall coming from a guy who thinks these types of games are kind of a mindless chore.
mph82,"Jan 27, 2015",10,"Best gaming experience I have had yet on PS4!! So addictive, and so many fun and unique elements of game play.  Breathtaking graphics, intriguing story line, and lots of cool powers. I played every day for a month straight whenever I had free time. One of the most fluid and smooth controller interfaces for a modern game, and no glitches. BUY IT!"
Brendon6446,"Jan 21, 2015",10,Loved this game! The combat is so fun i just played for hours when i first got all i did was kill uruks and level up to upgrade my power. This game makes you feel invincible (not in real life). Now i do suggest getting it on the next gen because they made it for next gen. They just came out with it on the old gen to make more money. Its not the same on the old gen. To get the best experience buy it on the new gen.
Darko84,"Jan 20, 2015",7,"Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor is an interesting game worth playing but never to be considered as best game of 2014.

The game is clumsy mainly due to the camera and the ""stealth"" system (very poor).
Orcs cannot see you when you are standing next to them but they can see you if you are hidden in the bushes! Game play is very similar to AC and Batman Arkham series (as many people have already noticed), which for me it a good dynamic for this kind of games. The story development is interesting and the Nemesis system make this game worth playing it (specially if you are a LOTR fan).

Positive Things:
+ Nemesis system.
+ Story.
+ Graphics.

Negative things:
- Camera.
- Stealth system."
kyazlar,"Jan 16, 2015",9,"This game has good graphics and fast gameplay but the worst senaryo.
Nemesis is a great system.  I think Shadow Of Mordor  is the best game of the year.
2. the game has to be better."
Red-Opposom-098,"Jan 15, 2015",6,"After looking at what this game looked liked, well it looked fun and it was for the first hour. Now the nemesis system is probably the best part of this game next to seeing the stupid names the enemy's have. The combat system in this game is great and isn't to easy to counter everything but it can be way to tricky when fighting 10+ enemy's. But at times the game can be way to boring."
670Gamer,"Jan 14, 2015",6,"Fighting mechanics is kool, environment is okay, and enemies are okay; thus, the 6 rating.

Same view about the game in regards to ""go there,kill then go there and kill"". I would have loved this game if there was no enemy respawn. Instead, give the player the benefit of conquering the whole map. Would have really like to conquer a section and then after that, human/elf/and dwarf allies would settle there, but no, you kill then they come back to get killed again. You end up using stealth wherever you go if you don't want to  fight forever. Yes, the # of missions ****. The upgrades are okay, but require multiple button smashing and timing. Story is hardly there unless you want to get all the collectibles and see if they are relevant to the story. Only watched the Lord of the Rings trilogy (not the Hobbit ones cause I am not interested in those) and don't see a strong connection."
electriclight41,"Jan 14, 2015",9,"Whenever I go out of my way to get all the achievements in a game, you know I think it’s good. Shadows of Mordor is one of those games.

There is nothing more satisfying than taking down orcs with style. The learning curve is a little steep, but once you get it, it’s pretty easy to slaughter scores of enemies or get revenge on your nemesis. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience, but would probably refrain from a 10 because it doesn’t have a ton of replay value."
Frederik,"Jan 13, 2015",10,"Exquisite game. I have been captivated since the moment I started the game and now I want to finish it. The story moves at a good pace and the graphics are very well done. Especially the cut-scenes are worth a watch.
The combat system is fluid and gratifying; certainly during the second half of the game you feel quite powerful as you have an extensive arsenal of moves and executions at your disposal.
Surely, this is not an overly difficult game. Be prepared to die several times at the beginning, however, when you haven't leveled up on health.
When you die, several Uruks gain a higher rank and become a bit more difficult to kill, but overall I haven't had many difficulties slaying the wretched orc leaders or war chiefs.
You can also decide how to approach a battle: either you take individual orcs down one by one by killing them from stealth with your bow or dagger or you can attack them head-on with your sword.
For the completionists, there are also objects and herbs to collect, a grand puzzle to solve and kill challenges to complete, so if you want to beat the game entirely, you will easily invest over 40 hours in it.
My conclusion: the outstanding graphics, captivating world and lore (if you're a LOTR fan), satisfying gameplay and interesting Nemesis-system make this game a must-buy in my opinion. It has been a long time since I have been so excited by a game."
overkoell,"Jan 12, 2015",8,"Shadow of Mordor is exactly what it wants to be. Assassins Creed in Middle Earth.
It does not reinvent the wheel. But it doesn't have to.
It looks good, sounds good feels good and most important is fun to play.
The long time fun is questionable because even if you go for a 100% play trough it wont take you 30 hours and there is simply no reason to ever play it again.
The game difficulty is way to easy and it does not force you to think about what to do because you can always get out of tricky situations with your sword or just... walk away... and i mean WALK away because no one in Mordor is following you anyhow.
Shadow of Mordor is a very good Assassins Creed Clone and for LOTR fans it definitely is worth a look."
that_paulrus,"Jan 12, 2015",4,"The Nemesis system is a great mechanic but the rest of the game is a big miss for me.  The plot is at sub-Destiny levels, and the main story can be finished in about 6 hours without rushing.  The small supporting cast is comprised of throw-away stereotypes and although Troy Baker is always good, Talion is just another boring white bread protagonist.  Others have mentioned camera issues, which I also agree with.  The combat is deeply unsatisfying and devolves into a button masher pretty quickly.  Ranged combat can be fun but is overpowered, and the stealth mechanic is horribly broken; most of the time you can ""stealth"" kill an enemy right in front of their pals and no one notices.  I played this directly after finishing DA:I and the entirety of the SoM area is about the size of the starting area in DA:I.

The problem for me is that there's nothing to do once you beat the very short ""story.""  Running from stronghold to stronghold fighting the same two enemy types by button mashing gets old quickly, especially given the insane respawn rate of enemies after you clear an area out.  Picked it up at a good discount so it was still worth the money, but overall this is a forgettable, mediocre experience hiding behind its fun Nemesis system."
hemmo1986,"Jan 12, 2015",7,"While an enjoyable game, it borrows heavily from the Batman and Assassins creed games; while this isn't necessarily a bad point as those games are undoubtedly great titles, it does however create a feeling of "" haven't I been here before?"".

The one saving grace is the new nemesis system that has been quite astonishing and it will be interesting to see how its implemented in future games; something people should truly be excited about.

Overall this game is good just don't expect  a revolution in game design."
Manjisan13,"Jan 11, 2015",9,"Surely one of my top picks of 2014.

Overall good **** clearly understood why gollum was there?

Not a rip-off from AC series. Thanks to the awesome nemesis system, the world around you feels alive and how you confront the enemy is splendid well done."

Megadonx92x,"Jan 8, 2015",10,"Let me start off by saying that I don't understand how anyone can give this game a bad review. Shadow of Mordor is by far the funnest game I've played on the new consoles. It pretty much is the Batman Arkham and the Assassin's Creed series mixed. I never really played much of the Batman's but as a fan of Assassin's Creed, I'm a big fan of this game. The game play is smooth, counters look awesome, and the game play is very fun and addictive. There's nothing more fun than going around and slicing orcs' heads off and the animations make it that much better. The graphics look great and the story is pretty interesting. I think this game is very well put together and, to me, is the best game of the year for the new systems. If your true gamer there's no excuse not to have this game in your life."
AylanChaos,"Jan 5, 2015",4,"I really wanted this game to be good. I tried playing it on three different occasions (thinking it was just me), but each time I played it - the game went completely flat after a couple of hours.

The gameplay mechanics are downright ripped off from Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkam - yet they aren't done as well. The open world could not be more boring and disappointing. In the end, this is a fighting game disguised as an open world adventure.

At it's very best, it's fun to hit the buttons for an hour to see some cool animations. Without that single component, I would have rated this game a 1. The graphics and sound are last generation polished up with stale overused voice acting. The story, well, there is none. Just an intro cliche revenge setup style cutscene and a ""go get em tiger."" Everything after that will put you to sleep.

The gameplay I would only recommend to someone entirely new to the gaming scene or a child who is easily entertained. Every single thing this game does has been done (years ago) and done much better. The nemesis system is a cool concept, but only leads to the same repetitive ""kill this guy, kill that guy"" scenario.

My gut told me that this game was going to be iffy, but it got so many good reviews from review sites. IGN gave this garbage a 9.3 and it's what led me to wasting 40 U.S. dollars on a game that I had to force myself to play multiple times only to come to the same conclusion that other negative reviews on metacritic have.

Ultimately, this is the 2014 version of an old school hack and slash that goes nowhere in the end."
Snowe,"Jan 4, 2015",7,"This game is SO much fun throughout the story mode, but that's why I gave it a 7. After story mode, like allot of other games, the replay value dies WAY down. It truly was a fun game when I played it though, I didn't wait for any DLC, just beat it and traded it in. Great game though!"
jedi5diah,"Jan 4, 2015",3,"Going past the hype and many so called ""true, unpaid reviewers"" recommended this game i went ahead to try it. i couldn't believe that anyone could actually complete this game. its extremely repetitive since the very beginning, esp the raved nemesis system. it just pops out anywhere and everywhere interrupting and was extremely irritating. Making the system redundant to have any real meaning because another one will spawn over n over again.

Graphics
Seriously just a better old gen version. it just look like any other game i played on PS3 esp on big led tv it just look pathetic.

Art Direction
its LOTR well, there's anything fresh or interesting anymore. so where are your companions? A ghostly elf is not!

Gameplay
i have no idea that pple can actually enjoy this, i cannot fathom. they simply swarm you with enemies and pops out a captain out of nowhere and one hit you again n again n again..."
Type4101,"Jan 3, 2015",7,"Fight the controls as you battle across a small section of Middle Earth!  A wonky control scheme makes mistakes, random leaps off of things, and button-mashing combat commonplace in this game.  Be prepared to fail many, many missions because of the controls, that will send you leaping into the line-of-sight of an orc on the countless stealth-only missions.  Frustration aside, the game is otherwise a solid stealth-action game (when the controls cooperate), that is light on story and narration, but will fill the gap as we wait for (hopefully) better games, like the Witcher 3.  Shadows of Mordor suffers from the plight of many open-world games....namely, repetitive missions and collectibles that are there for filler.  Kill orcs...then kill some more...then some **** then again.  Still, in a year when games ranged from horrible-to-mediocre, it stands out as better than many.  Beautiful graphics (for those that care about such things) and excellent voice acting (for the very few lines of dialogue).  A solid game, but too frustrating and repetitive to be an instant classic."
Jellybean15,"Jan 2, 2015",9,"Shadow of Mordor is a game that didn't have a lot of hype leading up to it. Many wrote it off as another  cash in of a famous license that ripped of gameplay from popular franchises while promising what many thought the game couldn't deliver. Despite this, Shadow of Mordor not only lives up to it's promise, but it also rises as one of the best game's of 2014.

SOM's story centers around Talion, a Blackgate ranger who's brutally murdered along with his family in a ritualistic killing committed by the Black Hand of Sauron, in the hopes of summoning the spirit of Celebrimbor from beyond the grave and absorbing it's power. Celebrimbor instead merges with Talion, bringing him back from the dead in a quest for revenge against Sauron and his allies.

It's an interesting start to a game, but what really makes SOM shine is the brand new Nemesis system, a mechanic that centers around the Uruk hierarchy. Through your actions, you'll see Uruks rise in power, die, and even fight each other. If an Uruk kills you, they'll rise in rank and power. If you kill the Uruk, another will take his spot, or he'll come back later with scars caused by your last encounter. What truly makes the Nemesis system stand out is that every Uruk remembers you and your actions. If you defeated them, fled, or even died at their hand, the Uruk will remember your actions when you meet again.

Besides their unique names and titles, the Uruks also have their own set of strengths, weaknesses, and fears. Some Uruks have to be taken down using stealth, while others are impervious to it. The same goes for combat and your ranged attacks, with some being weaker to certain attacks and more immune to others. Also, if an Uruk has a fear, you can exploit that to put them in a weakened position, and all of these factors force you to plan accordingly, changing up the gameplay with each enemy you face.

This mechanic truly hits its stride when you get the ability to brand, which gives you control of an Uruk's mind and free will, allowing you to turn him against his allies, which in turn spawn events that you can get involved with directly, or let them play out by themselves. The simple ability to brand makes the Nemesis system more fun than it already was because it allows you to bend the Uruk hierarchy to your will. Ultimately, the Nemesis system is an amazing, innovative mechanic that makes SOM the first truly next gen title. It's a system that promised way too much but ended up delivering so much more.

Of course, none of this would matter if the gameplay wasn't good, and fortunately, it is. The combat is a blast to play with, mainly because it's simple to understand but has so much substance behind it, especially when you start upgrading and unlocking new moves. Admittedly, the combat and a lot of the extra mechanics are lifted straight from the Batman Arkham franchise with SOM taking it's own spin on it with sword based combat, with all of the blood and brutality that Batman would never resort to. The game does add its own spin by allowing you to instantly switch to your bow, causing time to slow down and allowing you to line up precision shots or blow up explosives. However, the counters, stuns, and vaulting are all reminiscent of Arkham, with the only real complaints being that the vaulting is a somewhat wonky mechanic and that some of the more unique enemies have overpowered cheap attacks, but these issues get easier to deal with as the game progresses.

The stealth and climbing mechanics also highly resemble the Assassin's Creed franchise, which let you scale walls, navigate beams and ledges, and dive from high spots, just like AC. However, the stealth gameplay is what truly shines and actually manages to surpass the AC franchise, making stealth so much more accessible and fun than AC ever has. In all honesty, the stealth and parkour mechanics are actually a step up from the AC franchise.

Finally, the last thing this game did an outstanding job on was the graphics. The game looks absolutely amazing, with beautiful colors, amazing detail, fantastic rain/hail effects, and a consistently smooth framerate from start to finish. This game is an absolutely technical marvel.

The only place this game falls flat is with the story and characters involved. Although the story starts out strong, and immediately captures your attention, the game never really manages to reach that height of excitement again. Many of the characters are boring, Talion and Celebrimbor included, and the few interesting characters included aren't that important to the story. Plus, it doesn't help that relationship between Talion and Celebrimbor lacks any real chemistry or interesting dynamics. Finally, the ending is a weak sequel-bait conclusion with a disappointing boss fight to top it all off.

Despite that, Shadow of Mordor is an amazing game, with gameplay that'll keep you hooked from start to finish. I don't care what kind of game you're into. You cannot pass this game by."
TragicShow,"Jan 1, 2015",8,"Two words- Nemesis system. Shadow of Mordor lets you create your own story as you fight unique orcs. It is so satisfying to kill an orc after he had bested you before. The story is short, but you can find yourself invested in your own as you continually hunt down orcs/build an army. It has an excellent combat system and level/perk system. However, the story is too short, and should only take about sixteen hours to complete. There are quite a few side missions, but they are very similar and can be finished quickly. There are two maps, but they are only as big as they need to be. Don't expect to traverse through all of Mordor and visit all of the iconic places from the book or movies. While pretty, the landscape is pretty much the same thing everywhere. The story is also uninteresting and the final boss battle is an incredibly anti-climatic cutscene. You will likely find yourself far more invested in your own story other than the one that is presented. The game rates so highly because as far as gameplay goes, it's perfect."

-MY REVIEWS ARE TO HELP THE UNDECIDED = D E C I D E.

--This game should be in Game o' The Year running.
-facts-
-The game was released just prior to all the super heavyweights like Halo,GtaV,AlienIsolation,SunsetO,DragonAge etc etc. So like most next gen gamers I didn't hesitate as this was considered a highly anticipated game,.
--pros + Cons
-The combat has the Batman Arkham City style-  AWESOME!
-Story- MEDIOCRE AT BEST! ESP for a Lord of the Rings game. LOTR was always far-fetched but a str8^shost is taking it to the ridiculous..
--Main Character/Protagonist= Talion is gpGREAT voice acting,,But what annoyed me sooo much was The Writing of Talions **** is so thuggish,thug is the ultimate word to describe him. For a good deed,,help innocents,yadda yadda yadda type= he sure gives off the aura of """" I'm going to help you,,but I'm gonna complain about it & my huffy puffy posturing says I'm SOO annoyed to help you""""...this drove me nuts the whole 4-5 weeks I played..every night!

---OPEN WORLD PLAYGROUND--AWESOME! The bread & butter of this game.. It is soooo addicting to find the random bad guys in green, identical to Batman-Riddler-Informants. you hit a button instead of killing them and they reveal info about the boss war **** you can put a bounty on ANY war chief/Captain
--the bounty--Think of tLking smack about somebody before a fight,,when you see that person they repeat you're **** talking but in question form. ""sooo, you're going to rip out my blah blah blahs?"""""" Lol---But it mainly raises the captains rank/level and thus makes the automatic rune he drops better, possibly epic..

--Runes-just a simple weapon attachment. You can put 5 into you're 3 weapons. And the 3 are auto equips. Only 1 bow,,1 longs word,1 dagger.. Dagger is ONLY used for stealth kills,,bow= ranged, sword-Melee basic combat.. The runes are the way you're weapons are ""custom""....a common rune is """"this blah blah regenerates at double the speed,,,or you run twice as fast blah blah...

--the games main positive coulda been sooo much more. the open world and fun combat coulda been SOO much more had they're been more to do.. If this open world had Farcry/or Fallout3/VegasStyle side missions then I woulda kept playing it...

--the future looks bright for gamers because this style of combat is sooo much better then the Skyrim style of block,then attack.combo multipliers are just rewarding..  See more games using this style. Woot!!!

---bottom line--Game of the year is pushing it.. I realized that typing my review.. But it IS a keeper, not a rental. Cause I did so much toyBox'n that I never even finished the main campaign. I already returned once to the game and was happy that I retained ALL the controls via memory..
---oh yeah--- THE DEVELOPERS DLC AND $1.99 runes are such a sweeeeeet perk. We all know that when we are **** in deep to a game that a $1.99 something cool & interesting is a good thing for us....
---I also fealt too powerful at the 1/2 way point,..because I side-quested SOO much,,and had fun killing for weeks etc= Talion quickly leveled up every single perk to the point that it became pointless to kill for exp or for gold..gold buys certain kind of perks, and exp buys the other kind..I easily maxed both waaaay too early...

A METACRITIC 83-87 is a ACCURATE Rating......"
BBoondocks,"Dec 30, 2014",10,"To me, Middle-earth: Shadow Of Mordor is the game of the year for 2014. Set in a fantasy world, made famous by the Lord Of The Rings books/movies, it is a combat orianted open world, action-adventure game where you control a hero, named Tallion, who was murdered along with his family, but got brought back from the afterlife by a mysterious elf, whose ghost powers give you incredible strength. It takes some great ideas from other video game classics, like the Batman Arkham series or the Assassin's Creed, but it's also original enough, with some awesome ideas, to make it a classic on it's own as well. One of these ideas is the Nemesis System, which basically allows you to play the game as YOU want it. You can choose to hunt down and massacre all the orc captains and warchiefs or you can brand them and create your own orc army. The story is also very cool, a revenge story with some fun, flamboyant characters, who help the generally dark story to be interesting enough to play through. The main focus is on fighting, Tallion is a master of brutalizing enemies with his sword, his dagger and with his bow. You can upgrade your moves as you progress, by the end making Tallion a close to unbeatable warrior. Killing warchiefs is not always easy though, as some of them are combat masters with very few weaknesses (these weaknesses you can find out by gaining intel from other orcs and then use that info to kill them - some are scared of fire, monsters, betrayal, etc and by realizing them you can execute them easier). It is also a sandbox game, so you can go around the world freely, whether on foot or by riding beasts, and choose side missions or main story missions in any order you wish. There are also plenty of things to collect and challenges to complete. As I mentioned before, the fighting is very similar to the Batman Arkham games, except it is a LOT more violent. The finishing moves and the executions are always satisfying and you can also use the environment to help you kill your opponents. You can also use stealth to mix things up or destroy orcs with caragors. The free running is a lot like we got used to in the Assassin's Creed series, it is smooth and easy, and Tallion can not die by falling, thanks to his elf powers. So all in all, this a must buy for everyone, I haven't played a game this great and addictive in a long time."
cbe,"Dec 29, 2014",9,"Great game!  The PC controls could definitely use some work; but if you haven't played Assassin's Creed (to death), you'll truly enjoy it.  The Nemesis system and overall strategy focus creates a great reward feedback that makes you want to take on higher level enemies in order to keep them from dominating you in late-game.  Highly recommended."
laserbeak,"Dec 28, 2014",10,"Middle Earth is an awesome game. I love the orc captain system, hunting those guys became my primary goal in the game, and its a very innovative twist on things.

I highly recommend this game if you like Action/Combat Narrative games"
felasi,"Dec 28, 2014",8,"I was hesitant about buying this game, but it turned out to be really good. People draw comparisons to Assassins Creed and Batman, but after playing it for a couple of hours I found its nothing like AC (never played batman, so i can't draw any comparisons to that).

The game play is really fun, and they throw in a couple of things as you play through to keep it interesting. The nemesis system adds a new dynamic to the game, and punishes players who go in to kill war chiefs or captains without gathering Intel to learn said captain/war cheifs strengths and weaknesses before hand. It was also a lot of fun to play the political game of turning orcs against each other so they are aligned to you and then plotting the demise of a war chief. The fun part about that is you can convert all of a war chiefs captains to your side and then challenge the war chief. The look on his face when he walks in to take you on, feeling good about himself because he has 4 captains with him but then realizes they are going to kill him. Priceless.

In the open world, I like how the orcs are just going about their business rather than being placed their just to take you on.

Story wasn't too bad and had some good moving moments, but don't expect a deep story from this game

There are few minor design issues; free running seems clunky in a few places. The end game is really easy once you have your abilities unlocked, and while that made for some fun killing, it kept me away from playing the game once I finished it (everything just became to easy). Once I was done with the main quest, I went back to kill some orc captains who killed me earlier in the game when I had no idea of what I was doing and who became very powerful as a result. Be sure to take the giant gruag for a destructive spin around mordor before your done with this game."
Derringer,"Dec 27, 2014",1,"Its a reproachable behavior to buy good reviews for an awful game. This is a copy of Assassins Creed and  its not Lord of the Rings anymore. They Ignore the Whole Story. I mean its so generic that even any other pseudo-epical plot (like narnia or hunger games, i dont know) will work with the same game mechanic. And one more thing: Its not an Open World Game anymore when the only thing available to do is killing orcs and all the environment around you looks the same: Just rock, dust & orcs & rock & dust & orcs."
easterfields,"Dec 26, 2014",10,"I'm usually a pretty hard sell on games that are based on film, television, and book licenses.  The main reason being that there's never enough attention to detail and production value put in such games as they are mainly created to cash in on the name.  There are a few exceptions though, and this may be the biggest one.  As a huge Tolkien fan, I will admit I was disinterested by the concept of this game when I first heard about it.  I really didn't feel it could do the books or films any justice, but I was hugely myopic in my assumptions.  This game truly is a work of art in nearly every way.  The attention to detail-such as the voice acting (the orcs are amazing!), the collectibles, the weapons, the graphics, etc. are all some of the very best I have ever experienced.  It's very obvious that this game was a labor of love by those who developed it, and that shines through in nearly every moment of playing the game.  And oh what fun there is to be had.  Visceral, intense, threatening, and awe-inspiring are just some of the adjectives that come to mind in a typical play-session of Shadow of Mordor.  They have done an outstanding job of presenting an experience that feels removed right out of the brilliant Peter Jackson films.  It saddens me to great lengths, that this title will not be receiving the attention and hype it deserves-lurking in the ""shadow"" of the other regurgitated titles that were released around the holidays (GTA5 as an example), for it truly deserves to be praised and heralded as a great gaming moment.  It is no doubt the sleeper hit of 2014 and would without question, be my pick for Game of the Year!"
Scottgun,"Dec 26, 2014",9,"Shadow of Mordor is exactly what a game based on Tolkien's lore is supposed to be: fan fiction. Trying to recreate the Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit is usually an exercise in disappointment. For an interesting excercise in this, watch Peter Jackson's films with the attitude that they are fan fiction rather than The Official Movie Version of Middle-Earth, and you might enjoy them much more. Shadow of Mordor mines Middle-Earth lore for all its worth yet delivers a unique story. Add the Nemesis system that turns the bad guys into real characters instead of faceless drones and you've got a recipe for success worthy of emulation."
Munkey,"Dec 25, 2014",9,"In the year of weak triple A titles and HD Remastered versions Shadow of Mordor is a welcome sight and fkr me the game of the year. Yes it has it problems but the fun you will get with this title makes the flaws of this title look small.
First the combat is a blend of Batman series free flow and counter fighting with the Creed series of stealth finishers. Combat is bloody, brutal and very responsive. The satisfaction of landing combos over 50 and the screems of enemies is music for my ears. Then is the ranged combat with the bow. It's there for does enemy archers,killing off straglers or to pin to the ground.
The RPG element is there. You have wraith and ranger skills to chose from. You can also upgrade your health, focus, number of arrows and ad rune slots to your weapons ( sword, bow, dager ). There is a good amount of things to unlock.
Mordor as an open world passes the test. You have ruins, old castles, forts and caves to explore. Let's be honest it isn't big when you compare it to skyrim, gta or da:inq but yoh will find it enough to please you. Then there is a second map with is a welcome change of the wastelands of Mordor.
Then there is the Nemesis system. It's briliant and funy at times. In short when an uruk kills you it gets promoted to captain. You can kill him but when the encounter begins the uruk has something to say. He can say how he killed you, mock you, threaten you and so on. If you fail to kill the captain he will escape or if he kills you he will raise in rank and power. Each uruk has his strenght and weakness which you can exploit. This system should be implemented in more open world/rpg games.
There are also collectables with lore, mounts to ride and more like in every open world game.
The story is good. Nothing special but explores the middle-earth lore. I won't go in the details but will just say it's ok possible the weakest point of the game but still far from being bad.
My only to concerns with game I had was the camera control in large fights. Sometimes it went in such an angle that you couldn't see or was stuck for a second. The other thing sometimes the climbing wouldn't work as fluid and when there was an enemy near you the game had some problem of recognizing what you wanted to do.
Final score for me is a 9 out of 10. The best game in this year by far. Combat, lore and Nemesis system! I want more. Got it for 29£ and it was the best buy this year on my ps4!"
Underpants158,"Dec 22, 2014",9,"What is this game?: An open world action game. The action is defined by attacking, blocking, dodging, stunning, and a few other nifty moves that come in handy. The open world has bosses (captains, warchiefs) roaming around minding their own business, main missions, side missions that include messing with some captains and warchiefs, and side missions that focus on bow, sword, or stealth dagger play.

Pros:
-The action aspect works well. The blocking, stunning, and finishing somebody off is real satisfying
-Stealth kills are cool
-You can takeover orcs and have them fight alongside you
-The bosses (captains and warchiefs) have strengths and weaknesses that are unique to him and that you must exploit/avoid if you are to have any realistic shot of taking him down.
-The nemesis system can lead to unique and fun stories of killing each other.

Cons:
-Idc about the story or the characters. I forgot why I was supposed to be doing it all until the game told me again at the end.
-speaking of the end it was very lackluster both story and gameplay wise.
-dodging is delayed sometimes making it frustrating

Conclusions: You are surely not playing this for the narrative unless it's the one you create with your interactions with the baddies roaming around the world. That being said it is a great and addictive action game. I struggled with giving it an 8 or 9 but hey, it's christmas. Better make a second one and make it even better."
maveric_87,"Dec 19, 2014",9,"My first 30 minutes with the game were not thrilling. I felt it was a bit boring and unoriginal. However, once I got passed the 1.5 hour mark I was hooked and still am. The graphics are fantastic and really show off the world Tolkien created that Peter Jackson showed us on the big screen. The controls are solid using the combat system Arkham Asylum made famous. The story is well done for an action game and it does an excellent job utilizing the material provided by the books to give us more background on the setting, herbs, characters, history etc. One of my few gripes is the lack of a loot system which I feel could have been easily added to the game even with the rune system(which I loved) already in place. Being able to customize Talion's armor and weapons rather than being limited to different skins would have been the icing on the cake for me. The game setting although set in Mordor(hence the name of the game) could use some more variety to it. Now to my favorite part. The Nemesis system! It. Is. Awesome! Very innovative and adds a new dimension to games that are fun but lack a good challenge. I look forward to seeing this system evolve and be used in future games. Overall, this game is amazing! Worth every bit of the $59.99 price tag!"
themdr127,"Dec 19, 2014",7,"Shadow of Mordor was a highly anticipated game on my side, not because of the creators, nor because of Warner Bros, but because of a successful trailer.
Only a few trailer creators can add that ""spark"" to make me anticipated for ANY game nowadays.
The graphics and sound design was phenomenal, but the story line was rushed closer to the end.
It would of been best to post-pone the release date and add a richer ending, instead of a speedy cinematic.
Overall the gameplay was good, combat is very intuitive and smooth, 2-3 glitches in some places, but not as much as AC.
I dont regret purchasing the game, but i wont be buying any of the DLC content, its completely unnecessary, i would rather wait for the next installment to take place."
Keys1989,"Dec 18, 2014",10,"All the positive word of mouth is why I got this game. Well ****'s the first game I ever bothered to platinum.

I loved this game so much I can't possibly articulate it here. I think I clocked in at about 50 hours and it felt like 10 minutes. The combat is beyond smooth, in the early going I died often, but as the game progressed and my character got stronger things changed. I felt like a painter, my canvas was the battlefield, my brush a sword and my paint was supplied by decapitated and impaled orcs. SO FUN!

If I had to nitpick my only complaint would be that by the last quarter of the game I was an unstoppable killing machine and to die would take some serious effort. Also no real replay value but with how much is there that is really not an issue. It's still a great value and worth every penny and then some."
Danulius,"Dec 18, 2014",10,"This game is an absolute must-have in my eyes. Being a huge Lord Of the Rings fan, I'm in love with the story line. the combat is brilliant, the perks for weapons is a great idea and the stealth and execution elements make the game even better.

Bringing this style of game into an open world lay out was an excellent idea, i cannot praise it enough. going from a dark and infested area of Mordor into lush greenlands brings a new appeal to a game. As i have never played a game like this, I easily put hours and hours into it without thought.

In regards to the story line, it sticks well to the events of the LOTR books/films, and brings elements of these films into the game, they've done an excellent job with this game, and i strongly recommend you get it!"
ed_hunter01,"Dec 17, 2014",10,Simply amazing one of the best game i ever play the combat system is amazing is like play a fusion of batman origins with assassins creed with a mod of lotr is a great game a must own
Storm1672,"Dec 16, 2014",8,"Let me get this clear; This is one of the best games of the year and was totally surprised  by its quality. Certainly did not see this coming. Now, besides that, I read all the press and reviews and have to say that I feel a lot of them were too biased I think by the fact that it surprised all of us.

The technical aspect is great, though did not care much for some of the artwork. The gameplay is too similar to some of the great great of the last years. The execution is great and so are the ideas, but there is little to do and every sandbox game needs a great world and Mordor is not it. It is very poorly designed. Ok, it's Mordor. Desolate plains. I get it. More variety was needed.

The best part of the game is how everything is well made and also the Nemesis system which is what takes this game from mediocrity and places it on top tier.

I think the sequel has some great potential."
janeausten69,"Dec 16, 2014",10,"Absolutely loved this game.  I got a PS4 specifically for this game and do not regret it.  It's basically Arkham Series combat, AC stealth and an open world environment.  The game does get a little repetitive, but that didn't bother me.  The gameplay was fun so I didn't mind doing similar things over and over.  I usually don't write reviews but I've noticed a lot of poorly written negative reviews.  For those who are criticizing the combat and nemesis system, I don't believe you truly understood the game.  I'm assuming that you wrote your reviews after only playing an hour or two, or just flat out didn't understand the game.  To me, this is a definite game of the year contender.  The only negative I found was the final boss battle.  It was definitely anti-climatic.  Other than that an excellent game.  Can't wait for the DLC and hopefully a sequel too."
windbite,"Dec 13, 2014",8,"Purchased Middle Earth because of the great ratings on metacritic and haven't been disappointed. The storyline is interesting and control is nice but a little tricky.  The biggest flaw to me with this came is the camera/view angles.  The graphics are very good, but I'm still expecting more against my PS3."
Balon,"Dec 12, 2014",7,"Its fun and cool looking sword fighting. But after you have killed 10 000 orcs, you start to feel like that there should be variety in enemies. Where are the giants, trolls and other fantasy **** And the ending, its just too easy feels like you dont play at all."
stratagemmedley,"Dec 12, 2014",8,"Shadow of Mordor is a hybrid between a sandbox and Arkham-style brawler that is set in the famous land of Mordor, in which you play as Talion, a ranger from the black gate who is brought back from the dead, after having his family slaughtered in front of him, by a wraith who had forgotten his past (I would just outright say who he is but I don't want to spoil, even if it is completely obvious who he is).

I think I speak for many of us, Tolkein fans and traitors alike, when I say that expectations for Shadow Of Mordor were rather low, it both being a movie/book tie in game and a Lord Of The Rings game, which (unless you count that one RTS game which I thought was kind of good) are both historically **** or at least not really that good, largely due to heavy pandering to the fans by focusing exclusively on accuracy and completely forgetting that video games are supposed to be fun. Either that or the other way round where the devs don't give a rat's arse for the fans, or humanity in general, and end up creating an abomination which even the flaming pits of hell wouldn't admit to creating.
However Shadows miraculously avoids this and manages to both be a fun game while at the same time expanding on the franchise, though it is non-canon so I suppose it matters little regardless.
While we're on the topic of fun, my oh my is Shadows fun, it manages to blend elements from Assassin's Creed and Arkham games rather effectively while at the same time adding in some fresh ideas of it's own. The best singular example of this would be the much lorded Nemesis system, which allows you to look into and target the more powerful Orcs within the Orc hierarchy itself and once intel is gathered, learning their weaknesses and strengths so as to make the task of murder much more successful and that's only the beginning, it gets even better when you insert your own mind-controlled orcs into the mix later on in the game.
Also when it comes to murder, SOM gets a big fat check from me, as the combat and the enemies are both fun, intuitive and interesting, I especially like both the fantastic voice-acting and the way that the head orcs (to put it simply) recognise and talk to you, for example if you made them flee last fight you had with them, then they will reference that when they talk to you, which adds a much more personal feel to the Uruk, who by the way are all randomly generated, so everyone will have their own War-chiefs to square off against.
So let's talk about environments, the land of Mordor is quite ""next-gen"" on the PS4 as it looks pretty despite being so desolate, also for those worrying that Mordor will be another generic dark bland sandbox needn't worry as there is also another, more lush part of Mordor to explore, so despite the sandboxes being kind of pokey when we compare them with other games, they still are interesting and have plenty to explore within them.
So all in all a solid game, which though is hardly revolutionary manages to be fun and even at times half-way intelligent with it's interesting characters, that in it's whole, I cannot complain too much about, though if you don't like killing orcs and doing little much else, avoid it like the plague, otherwise I recommend this to everyone. (Unless you're a **** killjoy who can't handle one minor inaccuracy within the mythology, in which case what are you doing here? There's a new hobbit movie to complain about)"
SerialSeaguller,"Dec 10, 2014",8,"Pros
-Love the nemesis system
-Good graphics
-In-depth skill tree
-Strongholds are fun to wreck
-Great open world

Cons
-Short and mediocre story
-No items or loot
-No class system though you can focus more on ranger or wraith
-Meh quests
-Prepare to rage at some Uruks

Overall The Shadow of Mordor is a great game worth the buy. Though I found myself more focused on the open world and nemesis system than the actual story I still had a great time and can't wait for the dlc. My advice:Pick it up when its on sale on G2A or something. (I got it for $25 and have seen it go for $15)"
Skagzilla,"Dec 10, 2014",10,Best game I have played in a long time I've played for 46 hours and I'm only 50 percent through all the side missions and everything. It's a game that you can put hours into without getting bored I love and I recommend this game to anyone who plays games
snip4r,"Dec 10, 2014",10,"Lord of the rings assassins creed minus the assassins creed glitches. Enough said? No. This game also combines what was great about not just assassins creed, but also the batman arkham games. Plus it adds in whole new ways to look at the lord of the rings universe. Great game recommended."
Gbomb,"Dec 10, 2014",8,"I enjoyed this game, it was fun, fast and frantic but with real style. Take the Lord of the Rings world and plonk everything that has been good in action games in the recent past and here's what you get ""Lord of the Arkham Creed"". I found that I could overlook the slight lack of depth within the story here as each time I picked up the controller I had a blast, great fun."
Jarl_Redbeard,"Dec 8, 2014",10,"It's been a while since I played a recently released game that has provided so much fun for me.  In a day where we're flooded with multiplayer-focused games with thin stories and 6-hour or less ""campaigns"", Shadow of Mordor is really a breath of fresh air.  Simply put, I can sit down and play this game and just have simple, unadulterated fun with it.

The game is deep enough to provide some interesting RPG elements (leveling up attributes, learning new skills, collecting runes to add different powers to your weapons and deciding which ones are the best to fit your play style, etc.), but stays simple enough to feel fun to play no matter what you choose or how you choose to play.  You never feel hindered by choosing one attribute over the other or learning one skill first before another.

The gameplay itself has been criticised for ""being an Assassin's Creed rip-off"".  But hold on ****'s not forget a little game released in 2003 called Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, which came long before both.  Uncharted also uses this leaping/grabbing/acrobatic-style gameplay to great effect.  I am not a personal fan of the Assassin's Creed series (it has fallen victim to the CoD one-a-year treatment), but the point trying to be made here is this: although the games have similar mechanics, I feel Shadow of Mordor uses it to a greater, and more fun, effect.  Simply put, don't let the haters detract you from at least trying the game.

The core fighting gameplay is very fun.  You can complete the game using button mashing if you desire, but certain unlockable skills later on reward you for timed combos.  Fighting 1-5 enemies or so is an easy affair; however when you get ambushed by a Captain and they bring in 30 or 40 Uruks to aide them, the tides turn a bit and you are constantly kept on your toes by having to counter attacks and keep your combo counter up to perform executions.  I especially enjoy the stealth gameplay; performing aerial takedowns and ""brutalizing"" Uruks which makes enemies flee is very satisfying.

The Nemesis system is also done very well.  Enemies will remember you if you fight them, do not kill them, and come back to them later.  Scars from the battle will remain on their bodies.  You can gain intel from lower-ranked Uruks to learn the weaknesses of the Captains which will help you defeat them quicker (example: some Uruks might be able to be killed instantly by a stealth attack, or a charged bow shot to the head).  Learning intel also tells you their strengths; some Captains, for example, are enraged when they are on fire and will become stronger and regenerate health.  It makes for some very interesting fights.

The gameplay missions are varied by objectives of different kinds; you have the main story missions which progress the overall plot, but there are also side missions, which range from upgrading your weapons to participating in helping one Captain overthrow another, and more.  There are also various things to collect inside the game world that reveal lore and backstory in the game, and small ""missions"" that add to the overall game percentage completion (collecting herbs, hunting).

In all, the game is very well done.  I don't usually give any game a 10, but I've had so much fun with this one that even an occasional minor glitch (which I personally haven't experienced yet but have heard about) doesn't detract from the fun I've had.  If you're a fan of LotR, or you just want a fun, action-packed game in general, definitely pick this one up and give it a shot."
mearlam,"Dec 6, 2014",9,"I played this game for 50 hours and enjoyed everything it had for me to do.
I will warn you that the game is a little harder than the average game these days but with a little patience you get rewarded for it.

A serious quality game that is bug free (a new concept these days), if you want to chop off orcs heads then there is no better"
Heater,"Dec 4, 2014",5,"Played the game for two hours, unlocked a few abilities, and didn't find a new respawn point. I'm not sure how people rate this highly for the combat or for the LoTR feel but this game feels a lot like AC with all the sneaking around and stealth kills. The combat is mashing the attack button with an occasional special move or blocks. Button reuse means you'll accidentally do the wrong move 50% of the time when doing anything other than mashing attack. You can easily get overwhelmed by enemies if you're not careful and if there are ranged enemies in a large group you'll need to hide until you can get a smaller group.

I spent over an hour making my way to the first boss after practicing a few groups fights. I did a couple of side missions on the way and explored a bit but mostly went toward the target area. I beat him in about 30 seconds then celebrated by picking up the rune or whatever he dropped. The tutorial popped up, like it always does after you die or restart the game, which promptly caused the game to hang. I loaded back up to realize I had to do it over again. This along with always respawning back where the game starts just made it feel like I was never going to get anywhere so I decided to set the game aside until it gets patched.

The story actually seems cool, I mean who wants to play through the movies, right? It's an original take on events surrounding the return of Sauron. The abilities and combat style seem much like what you would expect to see in a LoTR movie when you're not sneaking around. The progress of your character being somewhat matched by promotions among the Uruks makes the game more immersive, especially when you seek revenge and they talk about you not staying dead.

When you kill a boss the enemies around you actually run away. How many times have you played a game where you killed a hundred enemies who never had a chance but just attacked you anyway? Who knew the Uruk were so smart? Too bad they are all near-sighted and hard of hearing. Lost count of how many times I stealth killed an orc 10 feet away from his friend, while they were talking, and the other guy didn't have a clue. Was funny to hear them rag on their dead comrades though.

Would have rated this higher if the game showed new spawn locations on the map, made combat a little more complicated or less buggy, and had no bugs in critical story missions. Not restarting the tutorial popups so often would have been nice too."

ravennoir,"Dec 3, 2014",10,"Just finished the story for this and its great. Good pace and game mechanics. Ill be continuing to play to get 100% completion, and might even replay it from the start :). Highly recommend. Lets hope for a sequel"
dazerb,"Dec 2, 2014",0,"Awful.
Imagine mashing Batman and Assassins but doing it all far worse. Sound is the worst, bad, inconsistent - after guys are dead on the ground and you've walked away, you hear them scream in death. sound never seems to match gameplay.
Story line is nonexistent. You can only figure out what's going on by reading ALL the little background pieces.
the awful ""save"" moments -  even a quick look at the map takes 10-15s to get into the map and another 10-15 s to get OUT of the map. You really have to decide how much time you want to stare at a black screen to review boss weaknesses.
the 'nod' toward strategy play is about a complete farce.
graphics are really bad. FAR worse than Bman or Assa, I get the limitations of open environment, but you never even get visual 'treat' in the lame cut scenes.
My game froze several times over the weekend mid - mission, causing me to have to reboot and lose progress.
The overall play is repetive and boring. After fooling with it a lot over the holiday, I am bored and don't care if I pick it up again.
I feel like a fool for paying $59.99 for this TURD! Maybe I can sell the game now and get some $ back for  ANYTHING else!"
Murredly,"Dec 1, 2014",8,"This game could easily have been a 9 or 10 but the sheer fact I can tell (or at least in my opinion) that this game was originally intended for last gen holds me back.

It is a fantastic game and an excellent open world. The dark gloomy atmosphere really pushes the idea of Mordor being a dark and scary place but also holds it up on the PS4. The world is big, but there is a lot of empty space filled sparsely with 3-person patrols or just plain empty space. Maybe it was as intended but I assuming this was done because older machines would not be able to handle the clutter. But based on the combat and lack of demanding graphical pieces, I am guessing this was done to make the game accessible.

My only other beef with this game is that the ""main quest"" chain is not intuitive. Maybe I am old but it took me a bit to get into it because the main quests were so far apart and setting waypoints to target them required a lot of back and forth between map-options-map-sauren's army etc.

That said, the dynamic enemies make the game a treat. If you aren't paying attention you can run into a mob of captains and followers - resulting in a brutal and fast death.

There is plenty of trophies for the trophy peoples and there is some replayability with the challenges and different combat styles.

Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone. If you see on sale (like boxing day or week long black-friday) - GRAB IT."
jonnykemp,"Dec 1, 2014",9,"Brilliant game. Finally there is a game from LOTR franchise worthy of everyone's time. Really we done, you find yourself getting immersed into the game and leaving the story on the side. This is a game I cannot get enough off."
Jozefow,"Nov 29, 2014",5,"I dunno, just rather unremarkable and repetitive to me. Once you find a routine that works for killing multiple enemies it will work every time. Fighting the Captains can be interesting but I was pretty much on auto pilot for the entire thing. This going to a spot on a map and finding stuff has to stop. They keep doing for all sorts of games and it's so ridiculous. It's certainly not bad but I doubt I'll do it again. Not as good as a game as Destiny but certainly fewer problems."
Dlindenberg,"Nov 27, 2014",9,Good game with a new perspective. Liked the side missions and main story is verry fun. You have much freedom and can do whatever you want and that makes it verry ammusing. WORTH MY MONEY
ToFewViews,"Nov 26, 2014",7,"Lord of the Rings hasn't released a game in awhile so, We have ""Middle-Earth:Shadow Of Mordor"" to keep it all going. Shadow of Mordor has the same game engine as the Batman Arkham series so it will feel very familiar to some people. The game throws tons of enemas at you at once and gives you some fun and flashy moves to use in slaughtering your foes. The story is alright, It's nothing amazing but keeps you interested.There was a very interesting system of Generals/Warchief you assassinate and progress through. On PS4 the game looks quite nice, big open spaces with tons of destruction and up close things don't lose there beauty. The addition of a Photo Mode in game is also nice,It give's people the ability to capture amazing kills.
At launch the game had a few bugs but with a couple updates released it's smoothed out the game-play a lot. If you enjoyed the Batman games or the Lord of the Rings Universe you'll find this game quite enjoyable with it's fast paced and brutal combat."
TheReviewNinja,"Nov 26, 2014",7,"This game is really, really good until it isn't.

I'll be the first to say, the combat in this game is amazing, the graphics are great, and its stealth is good. However, I found after just a few hours, the game starts to grow repetitive. The first problem is that the story is a huge drag. I often found myself just waiting for the missions to be over. The other problem is that when trying to accomplish the task of killing the five war chiefs, the game falls into a pattern of doing the same stuff over and over again, and never really adds anything new to the game for a significantly long time."

powerman449,"Nov 22, 2014",6,"Would be a much better game without the massive frame rate drops every few minutes even for a new system. Also could use a complete rework on control set up, current one feel like you are rolling and walking through quicksand in combat and button smashing for the first half of the game."
flipitdave,"Nov 22, 2014",9,"This game out Assassins Creed'ed Assassins Creed. It's a marvelously realized world that doesn't center around knowing the lore of Lord of the Rings. If you don't care about LotR, don't worry, the name is borrowed for marketing."
Game-Master,"Nov 21, 2014",9,"With being a big lord of the rings fan (and Batman fan), I was really excited to see how this game went and I was really surprised with how fun it was mainly because the nemesis system ,Its LOTR and the fighting resembles batman very much in a (good way)

9/10"
meediocre,"Nov 20, 2014",8,"Brilliant Orc'em Up, with various nods to Arkham and Assassin Creed games, mixed up with a Middle Earth setting and a novel enemy system. Hugely enjoyable for around 25 hours or so, then it starts to get a little bit stale. Although I love SP games, I can imagine how much of a laugh it would be to play this co-op, with perhaps a wider range of enemies and gameplay options. Would love to actually create an orc army and attack a fortress or something like in the sequel, of which I definitely hope there is."
HardFinn,"Nov 20, 2014",10,"Exceeded my expectations by far.  One of the few games that balances the main story and open world well.  The games selling point was the Nemesis system which was cool but definitely not one of the standout parts of the game. The most rewarding part of the game is combat.  Most of the time you will feel like you're in that first battle scene of 300...tearing through enemies.  Games like Assassin's Creed have a few death animations where as Shadow of Mordor never feels like they're recycled.

The story is decent overall (better if you're a Tolkien nerd).  Its definitely better than War in the North. I don't have many complaints but the combat does start off hard and then with the addition of new skills and runes it becomes significantly easier.   I'm giving the game 9/10 because I felt the end fight with my nemesis was anti-climatic and too easy. Its not a perfect game but definitely one of the best of the year!"
Purechaos,"Nov 20, 2014",8,"Very fun game.  I enjoyed the open world feel.  Combat was quick and tight, and had pretty good variety although at times could get repetitive.   The nemesis system was fun and interesting.    I would say that the scale of the world is quite small, but a very good first title."
Metamax,"Nov 20, 2014",9,Tis be a good one Capitan! This is a game I didn't have many hopes for tbh. A LOTR game coming out again. Much better game than AC and all around just fun to play. The Nemesis System in Shadow of Mordor is the highlight overall. I'm looking forward to a sequel that maybe takes us a bit further into the lore.
Tamerlanz,"Nov 19, 2014",6,"It is great game when you played half of it, but afterwards it becomes so boring! You have always to do the same thing - kill hundreds of uruks without any plot or necessity to it. All who put 10 to this game have you finished it?"
NoiNorac,"Nov 19, 2014",2,"Don't buy it.

The gameplay is horrendously lazy and the narrative **** Tolkien's vision. If you want something to waste time with and don't care about Lord of the Rings, then buy something else."
Tarthus,"Nov 19, 2014",8,"The game looks great. The controls are crisp. The fighting and stealth kills are satisfying. The storyline isn't very deep, but I feel that everything else made up for it.

The fighting system is very reminiscent of Assassin's Creed, but that's not a bad thing. It works very well in this setting, where you frequently find yourself surrounded by enemies. Manipulating the power structure of the Uruks via killing or branding captains and warchiefs adds a lot of depth to the game.

So others can weigh my opinion against my experience with the game: I beat the game and got all but three trophies."
Barendino,"Nov 19, 2014",8,"With all the triple A titles this year, this game came very unexpected. Shadow of Mordor is a great game with a few down sides. The gameplay is solid but gets a bit repetitive at some point. The world is gorgeous but feels a bit empty in some places. The major down side of this game is that it is way too easy. There is no difficulty level to adjust and that makes the game a bit boring at the end. The boss fights aren't challenging at all. The story is fun, but not really special.

Overall it's a good game, with no game breaking bugs (which is not common these days... *cough*ubisoft*cough*, solid gameplay and great visuals!"
HellOnFeels,"Nov 19, 2014",7,"Grabbed this one with my PS4 bundle. If you really enjoy LOTR you'll enjoy this game, there is enough story to keep you interested, the atmosphere is immersive and the combat is excellent. The upgrade tree's are well thought out and there is a lot to get done. For myself however it played out like another Assassins Creed, the game borrows much of what it is from other games and at times I felt I was playing Destiny with swords, albeit a far superior version. The graphics are incredible, the mechanics near perfect, enemies are challenging and diverse forcing the player to really think about his actions. The open world environment is full of action and provides for numerous surprises, you will genuinely feel as though you've stepped into Mordor. There is however an over reliance on gory finishing moves and the characters are less lovable than I would have liked and several hours in you may find yourself ditching some of the more repetitive aspects of the game. In all a good game but not for me specifically."
sbkw1983,"Nov 19, 2014",10,"Easily one of the most addictive Single Player experiences in years.  And to top it off, it's got a great and original narrative set in Middle-Earth, and which faithfully bridges the gap between Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

For many years now, I have longed for an AAA caliber Single Player game about Middle-Earth, and preferably having to do - at least in part - with Sauron and The Rings of Power.

For many years, I was let down - until now.  So thanks to Monolith, I now have the game I've always wanted.

Two caveats:

- The PS4 version tends to crash occasionally, but ironically, with less frequency as the narrative progresses.
- J.R.R. Tolkien purists may not enjoy part or all of this game for reasons I cannot comprehend, but valid in their views nonetheless.

---------------------------------------------

Verdict: 9.5 / 10 - Worth every penny.  I just wish that there would have been either an official strategy guide or an art book of the game available for sale, because this is definitely a contender for Game of the Year in my books.

----------------------------------------------

P.S. - UBISoft, please take note of this game.  It resembles Assassin's Creed (of which I am a hardcore fan of) in so many ways, and definitely more than any other third party game out there.

P.P.S. - Here's the bad news for you, UBISoft: Monolith has managed to beat you at your own game by not trying to adhere too much to specific things such as an annual release window, and graphics/polish over gameplay mechanics/fun factor (among other things).  You can do better - I believe in you."

kateuptonlover,"Nov 18, 2014",8,"This is an outstanding addition to the Lord of the Rings, and is a great tactical stealth, and adventure game. While it has repetitive missions, the idea of becoming ""leader of the land"" is a great placement to the game."
MattAldridge31,"Nov 18, 2014",7,"I bought this game after the patches so I've had absolutely no problems in that regard. On the other hand I've had a few problems with trying to love this game. I'm a huge LoTR fan and I anticipated this game as much as anyone so when eagerly shoved the disc into my PS4 I pretty much knew everything about it. I'd watched the videos, I'd seen the trailers and I'd watched the reviews - I knew what was coming. However, when I started playing it, it just didn't feel right. The game is very ambitious and the premise is interesting but the way certain parts of it are executed seems a bit rushed and underwhelming. Trekking across Mordor at times can be a chore and completing effectively the same missions over and over again becomes tiresome for me very quickly. I have enjoyed fighting and the main story is very strong in my opinion. It's what's been keeping me going. The side missions however have so far been uninteresting and repetitive. I enjoy the mechanics of the game and the slick fighting is wonderful to watch and take part in. The graphics compliment it well with finishing moves being as visceral and gruesome as expected. All in all it's a good game but not a great one for me. In my opinion it just needed a little bit more time in the oven."
HazardXMediaz,"Nov 18, 2014",9,"It's a game about killing Uruks, but it's a game about killing Uruks that does killing Uruks extremely well. The nemesis system is a real feat in game design, and I would love to see things like this in the future."

The gameplay is so much fun and non repetative like other games in the past. The challenges in the game are awesome and also the leveling up system is great.

Pacific_Inferno,"Nov 17, 2014",8,"Shadow of Mordor introduces the Nemesis System which is truly one of the best gameplay elements to be introduced into a game in a long time. For a game that would have been boiled down to Batman/Assassin’s Creed combat with Lord of the Rings decals on it, it provided a nice breath of fresh air. Every time you’re killed you’re killer is promoted and becomes stronger. Amug the Fanatical was ultimately my greatest nemesis; I could be out working on a side mission or another story arc mission and out of nowhere he would show up and ruin my day. Tossing taunts and insults into the brief cut scene that acknowledges who the Uruk is and being an ultimate pain in the ass I grew to hate him. It compelled me to continue with my quest, grow stronger and destroy him.
Shadow of Mordor starts out tough, and you die a lot. With this death you’ll continually build up Uruks in the ranks and make them stronger, until you finally become insanely strong and easily destroy all of your enemies. Although it becomes much easier, it doesn’t become less fun. My two biggest complaints are the two random appearances by Gollum, which could have been completely left out and not had any impact on the game, and the final boss fight which was a series of cut scenes and quick time event button presses. Overall, a pretty small list of complaints compiled into a larger list of enjoyable attributes.
TL;DR: Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor introduces a fun new mechanic in gaming that will irritate and please you at the same time, throw Gollum at you twice for no reason at all and end in a ultimately disappointing boss fight. 8.5/10"
razrien,"Nov 17, 2014",8,"Its Assassins Creed in Middle Earth.
You run around killing orcs.  Then run around and kill more orcs.

cntrl,"Nov 14, 2014",8,"9/10
well as someone who expected another poorly made and uninnovative game to make some easy bucks out of the lotr series, shadow of mordor is a pleasant surprise! it is really fun and even though it has some similarities with titles like assassins creed or batman, it is innovative in some areas. the story is fun, the game is good and it looks like it's actually finished and not a beta like many other games that have been released in the last couple of months/years (driveclub, ac unity, ...)
if you like some nice action adventures and the lotr series, you should definitely go for that one!!!"
kafkanian,"Nov 14, 2014",7,"It's a good game overall, with some really nice features like the Nemesis System, the combat mechanics and the skill tree, but the story isn't compelling at all and it becomes quite boring after 6-7 hours of gameplay.
For an open world game, the map is ridiculous. At first glance, you think it's big, but you can actually explore it all on foot in just 5 minutes! You'll be running around the same places over and over again."

Jokstar,"Nov 13, 2014",8,"8/10. The good - I really enjoyed the stealth aspects of this game. I loved the stealth kills animations. Sometimes I would just run out of my way on purpose just to stealth kill a solitary orc just because it felt good.

The story is well progressed with some nice animations too.

The bad - Sometimes the character will start climbing walls when you don't want them to. And the killing can start becoming a little repetitious but is saved by the characterisation of the bosses.

Would recommend it if you don't already have it. A bit like the old Tenchu but on steriods :)"
vallentagal,"Nov 12, 2014",9,"It's uplifting to see a game as refreshing as this after spending time with the atrocity that is Assassin's Creed: Unity. Even though it is very similar to other games of the past, it does enough to differentiate itself and improve upon previous foundations."

Mosh603,"Nov 10, 2014",8,"PROS:
-The storyline is decent and entertaining
-Fair amount of depth in the area of upgrading your character, not a massive amount but it still is challenging to upgrade your character fully
-I enjoyed many aspects of the game's engine. I liked how characters would remember you, and certain specifics about the battle
-The graphics looked decent
-Good amount of game time. I've put 20 hours in and am only 50% complete

CONS
-Warner Bros knocked off Assassin's Creed in many ways and mixed it with their Batman games
-The combat system lacks depth and is repetitive. It is a button masher for sure. All you do is hit Square and occasionally triangle
-Some of the special moves were clunky to use
-The main character could be more entertaining and have some more depth to him
-Only 3 weapons
-Some enemies take too many hits, especially in the beginning.
-The camera is not good. It moves too much and is can be in the wrong position
-The climbing can sometimes be inaccurate and frustrating

Overall, I would recommend this game."
Colinator,"Nov 9, 2014",10,"This game is probably the best game I have on my PS4 right now. The graphics are great. Combat feels like Batman and Assassin's Creed combined. The open world is near perfect. The only problem I have with Shadow of Mordor is the annoying difficulty. Sometimes I feel like I'm trying to play Assassin's Creed with my hands cut off!!! Being a huge Lord of The Rings fan, I love this game. Oh, and just so some of the haters out there understand, this game was made by the people that made the Arkham games. So stop complaining about how similar they are!!!"
Tom360,"Nov 6, 2014",8,"GREAT GAME. I question the replayability though. I've beaten it twice now and I doubt I'll get much more use out of it. Wishing I had purchased hard copy instead of download.

You can tell it's been created off of the Arkham games' format. Has an almost identical control scheme (which is fine by me!). This game shines when in the heat of combat, so if that's what you're looking for you won't be disappointed.

An extremely dark game - the opening is pretty shocking. The story is so-so in the whole context of the LOTR universe.

You can tell that the game is being released for past-gen consoles, which I think held it back in the graphics department. A game that came out much earlier on PS4 looks much better than this title. This didn't hold me back from enjoying it, however. I really had a lot of fun dessimating orc armies, then bending them to my will.

Overall, awesome, creative (which is more and more rare these days), addicting, well done!!"

colinb93rs,"Nov 6, 2014",9,"I would of given this game a solid 10 however I didn't like how the game started, short intro into the open world and then its left up to you to decide how you want to proceed. Initially I didn't like this but once I wrapped my head around where the game was going, I haven't looked back. Smooth gameplay, awesome cinematics and a very entertaining game. I have seen on a couple occasions that the camera angle does get turned around when a wall is close but knowing this makes it easy to adapt to. Overall, must buy great game for the RPG fans!"
sully22,"Nov 5, 2014",9,"Fantastic game, thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish, There are a few tweaks the developers could have made, for instance the ending / final battles were very disappointing.

goliva,"Nov 5, 2014",9,"When you spend 70 bucks on a game, the least you should expect is a master piece like this. SoM has an awesome setting, the best integration between movie scenes and in game content I have ever seen and a vast beautiful open world to explore finding some random stuff to do the same way you could find it in Red Dead Redemption but with a strong influence from Batman Arkham series and Assassin's Creed series. I don't like Lord of the Rings lore... I even hated it, but if you like epic games and Orcs (specially killing them) you won't be able to stop playing this. Also there are lots of collectibles and additions to complete. One of the most interesting things is also the way Sauron's army has its own living hierarchy. For an instance, if you die at the hands of an Orc boss, he will be rewarded with a higher Rank and you will see this in a screen that shows the current army's status, but also other Orcs can kill between them or the recently upgraded ones, taking their ranks. These things make them more powerfull, and is fun to find one who killed you in past again, and get revenge when he is suposed to be more powerfull and brags about thart fact. Also, there are many different ways to kill your enemies or create distractions... to mention one, you can just stay at distance and shot arows to free jailed beasts, and watch how they eat them all... or also runaway to avoid been eaten too! Brilliant!"
Tamel_Eidek,"Nov 5, 2014",9,"Fantastic game in all regards! Well made and stays fun well beyond the storyline - which is a satisfyingly original addition to the LotR universe.

It can be a bit of a one trick pony by relying heavily on it's combat system for all things in the game but that is not a bad thing when the combat system is one of the best in gaming currently - weighty, satisfying and skill based. Compared to other games coming out this generation this one is near perfect. A must buy for any fantasy or action/adventure game fans!"
catsandcaffeine,"Nov 4, 2014",10,"This revolutionary game came into the market not hyped at all, with it's amazing gameplay, it redeems itself as a masterpiece. I'm not a big fan of the Lord of the Rings books or movies, yet this is probably one of the most funnest games I have played in a long time. The nemesis system constantly gives you different personalities to fight and each of their personalities (through strengths and weaknesses) shows in the combat. Although repetitive controls at first, you gain a sense of accomplishment when using your newly-found skills, it's like giving your dog a treat after doing tricks. Combat in this game reminds me of the Assassin's Creed and Batman series, but with a much more eloquent display by having multiple ways of killing Orcs, not just with sword or bow. The sense of equality really brightens up the gameplay, none of your weapons will ever be overpowered, your battle is maintained purely on how you respond to each of your attackers, and the classes differ in each party so you're constantly having to focus on some Orcs first, which gives an amazing edge to the gameplay. 10/10, best game I've played."
Enforcer122,"Nov 3, 2014",7,"The game itself is a solid game. The combat is smooth, the stealth is tactical and it all comes together as an enjoyable experience. I just couldn't help but to feel bored near the end of the game... I had been doing the same stuff for 20 hours plus, the game forcing me to kill all the war chiefs before letting me move on was hugely frustrating. Some of the quests you do also felt meticulous and samey. If you're looking for a game to get plenty of hours out then go for it, but I found the novelty soon wore off."
tekshow,"Nov 2, 2014",7,"The journey to Mordor is a solid game, one built on the foundation of games like Assassin's Creed and Batman. That's not a figurative comment either, it literally steals pieces of those games like the climbing from AC and the combat directly lifted from Batman. That isn't a bad thing, even though WB games might get into some hot water from it legally. If you enjoy the AC series or the Batman Arkham games then Mordor will be right up your alley whether you're into the LOTR franchise or not.

That's where I found myself, I like Orcs, Dwarves and Rings as much as the next guy, but fantasy has never been my favorite genre. I'd rather have light sabers and laser beams like Mass Effect or Fallout 3.

Mordor does what it does well, a great quote ""If you steal from one person you're a thief, if you steal from many you're a genius."" Bruce Lee subscribed to this philosophy and apparently so does WB Montreal. It not only borrows all these facets of Batman and AC, but it IMPROVES on them.

The stealth component gives you more combat options than the big Bat. There's very deft range methods that keeps expanding the gameplay for the duration. There's a huge upgradeable skill tree that will take the longest playthrough ever, or if you beat Mordor in the typical time (about 20 hours) you'll barely be able to open up some of the most impressive skills.

That's all without talking about the nemesis system, which takes every underling and mini-boss from the game and turns them into a living breathing chess piece. Any grunt orc that kills you will begin moving up the Orc ladder. If any Captain or Warchief kills you his notoriety will increase, and so will his power, making him even tougher during the next encounter. Eventually you get the power to brand Orcs with your mark, eventually stock piling nearby gruns to help you take down the Chieftains. After that you quickly get the ability to brand even the warchiefs themselves and therein lies the best strategic idea behind Mordor: Do you brand the Warchief directly, or install fraudulent bodyguards that can help you remove him from his pedestal? Nearly always I found it easier to bring in my Orc trator bodyguards and do the job with me. Then ultimately the most powerful bodyguard takes the recently felled warchiefs place on the hierarchy map.

So it sounds all good right? Beautiful combat backed by two great franchises WB worked on, a good solid graphics engine, new upgrades to the formula and a huge skill tree to fill out.... and you know it's coming, there's a ""but"" in here.

Mordor stumbles slightly for a number of reasons, and some of it hinges on the gameplay and Nemesis ideas. There's always been flaws in ACs gameplay and while not massive some of that is still there. I will say that Tailion can grab a ladder or a ledge almost better than anyone in AC, I never felt like he did the wrong thing at the wrong time because of the game. If I blew a counter or jumped off the wrong ledge it always felt like user error, the way it should be.

It seems that WB was making another game, speculation is an open world Batman game. That might very well be true, but since Arkham Knight is on the way out and is open world the rumor is it was scrapped. WB has made a very well crafted game here, and it's plenty enjoyable, it got me to trudge through blood stained Orcs and the sprawling countryside of Mordor for about 30 hours.

The story is completely bare bones. Wife dies, get revenge, live with a ghots, kill Sauron, the end. There's a few cutscenes sprinkled in there, but it's pretty negligible even for LOTR fans. This game is all about the combat, and some times that's just not that exciting. The world is pretty bland with just two main areas, and strongholds of Orcs littered about. In fact, if you don't spend some hours swinging your sword killing and doing side quests you won't level up enough to have a powerful ranger. I almost completely ignored the main quests of the game for the first 20 hours and just leveled up. The main campaign is almost non stop fighting and often for no reason.

Not to be too harsh, but it almost felt like a LOTR Dynasty Warriors game for the bulk of it.

Finally the Nemesis system isn't as polished as it should be. I died at the hands of Orc captains or higher maybe 2 times during my entire playthrough. Mostly that's because I wasn't afraid to run away, combat in war is about survival and my feet would carry me out of danger. I'd hide for a bit and then exploit a major weakness. Other times I was near death and ran straight to the nearest underling for a quick death. It meant the bottom man on the totem poll got ranked a bit, but I avoided having the super elite Warchief grow in power. You also have a last chance move that saves your neck long enough to get out of most situations.

Mordor boils down to a hack and slash game. It's Batman, but 100% combat focussed. Depending on your mood that might not be a bad thing, I spent 30 hours there. Solid 7."
Kenshiro117,"Nov 2, 2014",9,"Unlike people say Shadow Of Mordor is not a Assasin's Creed rip off, well at least to the extreme that some people claim. I'd like to think it as hybrid of Assasin's Creed and Batman games.
But combat is extremely fun and easy to get into, feeling like you could take the whole army of the uruks at once, but throw Warlord or Captains in and it will be a challenge that most likely will get you killed, fast.
And when you die you can track the uruk who killed you and get revenge, thanks to Nemesis system which is a cool mechanic.
As for the visuals, it is what you'd expect from next-gen game, personally I do not care for such things.
As for negative, after you complete the game you don't feel like doing it again, but I had no major bugs, 2 minor clipping glitches but you could get out pretty easy.
But in the end lovely game, I suggest you get this if you like the genre."
foxviewchannel,"Nov 2, 2014",9,"Tolkien games have yet to reach their true potential; however, one of the biggest surprises this year was Shadow Of Mordor.  Shadow Of Mordor is an action role playing game which is set between the hobbit and the lord of the rings and is developed by Monolith.

The story explores characters not seen in the movies. The main character is called Talion, a ranger of Gondor responsible for defending the black gates of Mordor. Sauron, also known as the Dark  Lord sends his army to attack, you and your family end up being slaughtered., you are then brought back to life with magical powers and this sets you out for revenge on Saurons army.

Shadow of Mordor has immersive game-play.  The fighting is similar to that of Batman and Assassins creed but feels fresh with its new mechanics.  You will be using a combination of stealth to take out enemies unseen and melee combat.

As you progress, you level up your character and weapons and you will have access to all sorts of abilities like stunning enemies, teleporting, and crushing an enemies skull with your hands.

The world in Shadow Of Mordor feels alive.  The game fully utilities next gen and the attention to detail is impressive. the true strength in this game is the new Nemesis system that is unique and one that i have not seen done before.  all the enemies in the game move dynamically in the world with their own missions.

The enemies are distinct, with different ways of fighting, speaking, physical appearance and name.  If you injure an enemy while battling, they will remember you and taunt you when they see you again.  All enemies in the game have the potential to turn into a superior boss.  The Uruk army is always shifting and evolving while the Orcs don't rise up in the ranks.

Enemies will level up and improve their skills while roaming in the world and they will change positions which means no two game-plays are the same.  When you go into battle and a specific enemy kills you, then that soldier will move up the ranks and this increases his strength making him tougher the next time you face him in battle.

They will also challenge each other to compete for the top spot and those that win, grow in power and advancing an unknown warrior all the way to legendary ware-chief.

Each enemy will have their own weakness that you have to find out, and you can do this in numerous ways.  Interrogating Uruks for info to learn more about the characters in Saurons army and when you earn more upgrades,  you will earn the power to make enemies fight for you.  Using the power wisely can change a lot in the battlefield.

It is an exciting feeling when you watch an enemy that you faced before barge his way during a fight,  This creates a lot of tension.  Once you drain their power, you will have an option to kill them or free them, and once you gain power you will be able to summon an enemy into tasks such as taking out a warrior when the time is right.

Some of the campaign missions aren't as exciting as they should be and there is no multiplayer; however, Shadow Of Mordor is a true next gen game that is fun with good combat and one that is worth your time."
Irul,"Nov 1, 2014",1,"Wow, this game is so boring. At the start it seems promissing. Impressive animation and nice graphics. After a few missions it turns so repetitive that u do not even have fun anymore. Just smash buttons until you get tired of it. Very repititive. Will not finish the game, prefer to replay other games than finish this one."
Goltztyme,"Oct 30, 2014",8,"Shadows of Mordor plays very much like assassins creed 2. Which is wonderful, it was in my opinion the best assassins creed to date. It also feels very much like The Arkham Asylum Batman series, which i think again, I enjoyed. While it does have its problems with the climbing mechanic. Overall If you are a fan of either of these 2 games i would recommend you play Shadows of Mordor. My only problem with this game is after playing it for a while it begins to feels old. As if you've played it 1 or 2 times. Also failing missions requires you to abandon the mission and go back to the start mission indicator and restart. Which isn't a problem if you like running through hordes of enemies humming the LOTR theme. Overall I would say a pretty nice title to add to your collections."
Kraft,"Oct 29, 2014",1,"The graphics are nice, but the gameplay and the story are ****    I don't think anyone has ever done sword-based combat well though.  This game amounts to brief intervals of street fighter style mouse button mashing in between a ****load of long stupid cutscenes."
jstanothergamr,"Oct 29, 2014",8,"A very strong and engaging experience, mostly.
The story is a tad weak in driving the game, however, things like the Nemesis system constantly push the world forward.  Yes, the world could be a little bit bigger, but the designers did a great job of balancing the size with the large amount of enemies all over the map.
Randomly running into an officer was also an exciting experience.  Once, while I was fighting one (in order to gain intel about the warchief) I was met by 4 others.  Suddenly, a small battle turned into a large one with 5 officers and about 30 other orcs.  The game is full of exciting moments like that.
The leveling system and customization also perfectly match the length of the campaign and size of the world.  At no point did I feel like I leveled too quickly or not enough.
A feature that would have been nice is a difficulty setting.  I found that when I beat the game, even though I thoroughly enjoyed it, I had no urge to go back again.  If I could set it on a harder difficulty, I definitely would have given it another go.
My biggest issue, besides the weak story, is the final battle of the game.  It is essentially a 30second QT event, which really rubbed me the wrong way.  They had created such a great and exciting experience up until those final moments.
All in all, I think this one is definitely worth your money and time.  If your looking for an RPG action fix this is it.  Oh yeah, and the added bonus is that is J.R.R Tolkien."
StiffNippys666,"Oct 29, 2014",10,"If you're a huge LOTR fan and/or LOVE the batman series games, you're going to love this. The nemesis system is the Game of the Year changer! Slaying different orcs or helping them to become stronger is a very rewarding feeling. I love the new free DLC costume that they released. Finally a game for the fans! Can't wait for what they will introduce next or the next LOTR game."
bronbron,"Oct 28, 2014",9,"I don't understand the reviews positive or negative from people who played this game for a short period of time and feel that's enough to warrant a review. I have played it from top to bottom and finished the game. It exceeded my expectations, it was a blast to play from start to finish. The combat is fun and engaging, side quests are enjoyable and the story is good. Also this should be said it's not a quick story but not an extremely long story either. I think I beat it without doing all of the sides missions in around 15 hours. That being said compared to the watered down crap games we get these days (cough cough destiny) it was refreshing to play a game with a campaign that I can't beat in a weekend. One complaint is the camera angle on the main character the view is so it's right behind him and you can't change that, it was extremely annoying for me at the beginning but I surprisingly got used to it and didn't care at the end. Aside from that I have nothing to complain about. It's worth the buy and the time, I honestly can't see someone who plays through the entire game from beginning to end and not be satisfied."
timwarner,"Oct 28, 2014",10,Don't be fooled by the jackass claiming that we're being fooled by Warner Brothers paying people to give these ratings. This game is fantastic. End of story
welchmen22,"Oct 28, 2014",8,"Fun game the fighting mechanics are great story has been good. A few people mention fighting near walls that's true its a little tough to see but you can just rotate out or roll to a better position (pay attention to your surroundings). This might be unfair but I am disappointed in the lack of customization the game is great I guess I just look forward to being able to put your mark on a character. I love the idea of having the captains changing and having a rival. Lots of variety with the enemies. It does seem easy at times hopefully it gets a little tougher. Not a huge fan of stealth in games but this one uses the elements well without over doing it or forcing it on you too often. The game looks great too, overall I'm enjoying it."
the_great_owl,"Oct 28, 2014",7,"Shadow of Mordor is a good game, though full of flaws.

Combat system is great. It is swift, fast, bloody and impressive.
Visuals are great. I really liked the changing weather and the photo mode with which you can play around with creating nice screenshots.
Voice acting, music and sounds are top tier, I really felt that game is taking place in Middlearth.
Nemesis system is really innovative and gives a lot of opportunities to get rid of captains of warchiefs.

And that is about everything good this game can offer.

Flaws? Game is repetitive. After 10 first hours of playing you will know what rest of the game is about.
Characters are bland and forced into the almost non-existing plot. Plot is really disappointing, especially the ending, which basically is a short QTE...
Despite the nice Nemesis system I did not find this game challenging. To be honest game was getting easier and easier with new powers that you unlock during play through.

Having on mind that game is not a short one, I am kind of disappointed with its execution.
Instead of setting new standards, the game tries not to be Assassin's Creed/Batman clone inserted into Middlearth realm but ultimately fails to do so.

Shadow of Mordor could have been so much more."
armchairjerk,"Oct 27, 2014",5,Really isnt that much to this game. The plot is bad but the combat can make up for that. You're forced to run from captain to captain killing them while being subjected to quests that at times don't feel necessary. Wait for this game to go on sale.
seil3949,"Oct 27, 2014",9,"El sistema de jerarquía de los Uruks es la estrella de este juego, el sistema Nemesis como se llama, muestra la jerarquía de los orcos en Mordor, con un gameplay que fusiona mecánicas de la serie Assasin´s Creed y Batman Arkham series. La historia se apega fielmente a la Literatura de Tolkien, pero no los personajes, los personajes en su actuación son más una experienciade Hollywood. En si muy buen juego, con un Trofeo Platino muy accesible para todos aquellos Trophy Hunters."
FatBoyDave,"Oct 27, 2014",8,"Had to write a review of this wonderful game,Slashing,Stealth,Runes,Archery,from a five minute Uruk slaughter fest to an hour carefully getting into the story.This game is brilliant,great graphics and sound,the Nemesis system where your victors or battle scarred foes remember your previous encounters and taunt or remind you of your actions.Like most people have said a cross between Creed and Batman( no bad **** the crushing amazingly BAD news the last two end battles are an absolute disgrace,shocking,sloppy,poor,head shackingly **** got 9.3 I would knock off a point for the end,it's that bad !!!!!!"
Dukeo,"Oct 27, 2014",9,Story missions were good but 20 are not much i wanna more x;). Game is very good playable and no problems with moves (maybe climbing wall can include 2 buttons no only one).

HarrySound,"Oct 27, 2014",4,"This game is dull as dishwater.
I bought it based on the positive reviews. It really IS Assassins Creed with Batman combat and the open world zone clearing of Viking.
Movement is laggy , combat is button mashy , animation heavy and also laggy.
Graphics are polished last gen era.
Voice acting is the same old tired pompus english accents from London (oliver twist/orcs) , the Palace (posh) and the Farm (summerset)."
dyrankun,"Oct 26, 2014",4,"Not very impressed by this game.  I usually don't give games poor reviews but I'm just not thrilled by it.  In fact, I find myself forcing myself (unsuccessfully) to play just to try and get my moneys worth.  I will say this however.  Much of this is my own fault, for not looking into what the game actually was before I purchased it.  I saw a new LOTR game with decent ratings, had some extra money to spend, and bought it on a whim.  I was very disappointed by the fact that the entire game takes place in Mordor.  Yes, I know, the game title should have been a dead give away, but I didn't honestly think you could make a LOTR game all within the land of mordor.  What a shame.  I read ""Open world"".  Cool! I can finally play a LOTR game and go visit all those fond locations!  nope.  The environment is about what you would expect.  It's not that it looks bad, its just that it becomes very dull, very fast.  Everything looks the same after 10 minutes of play.  Everything plays the same within 10 minutes as well.  There's just no cohesion.  I feel as if I'm running around in circles, from one quest marker to the next (enough with the quest marker formula already).  It doesn't feel like I`m getting anywhere.  I would say that open world is not my thing, except that TESO games are some of my absolute favorites, so that argument doesn`t stand.  The combat is pretty dull in my opinion.  hack hack hack, counter, hack, groundkill, rinse and repeat.  There are so many enemies everywhere that even stealth stalking just feels insignificant.  Oh cool, I stealth killed an orc, too bad theres 50 more in every direction I look.  Just takes away from the impact of putting the effort in to stay in stealth, which by the way, you pretty much are forced to do when running anywhere.  I don`t know, I could go on, but really, I feel like I`ve wasted enough time and money in this game.  To put the effort in on a review of this game would just contribute to the waste.  I bought this as a LOTR fan, hoping that someone finally made a decent LOTR game.  How disappointing."
jack2059,"Oct 26, 2014",7,"Some wonderful features but lacking any soul.

The biggest underdog shock of the year is how everyone is describing this game.
Its got a very strong combat system, lifted straight out of Batman. And while its great, the combat on the whole can get very frustrating as you are swarmed by captains, beserkers and shield enemies.
A simple attempt at killing a war chief or captain can very quickly become a big test of patience and annoyance. This isnt helped by the camera system which can be very awkward.

The standout feature however is the Nemesis enemy system. This adds serious weight to the enemies around the world. Giving them names and personas.
Attempting to take down a War Chief is thrilling as he baits you with great lines of speech, then while you fight you hear the surrounding enemies chant his name.

The graphics are largely very good. Especially on a rain soaked evening the world looks beautiful.
The game world is like the story, very bland. Lots of wide open stony floored stretches of middle earth with nothing but rocks to see.

Where the game falls down most though, all importanly is the complete lack of a main character. You play a very bland person, in a very bland basic story. And its for this reason that the game just doesnt addict me. There is no heart to make the combat and nemesis system worthwhile

Give the nemesis system to a game like Assassins Creed or Batman and you could have something incredibly special."
AndyPatterson96,"Oct 26, 2014",7,The gameplay mechanics more than echo those of Rocksteady's Arkham games and Ubisoft's Assassin's creed but that's forgivable considering Monolith utilised (recycle?) them rather well and threw in an intriguing nemesis system to keep things feeling fresh. Tolkien fans needn't worry that the beloved LOTR license is tarnished either; Shadow of Mordor has an engaging and dark revenge tale at its heart that adds depth to the lore and setting of Middle Earth.
Raviel1827,"Oct 26, 2014",8,"The most next-gen game since Forza introduced Drivatar. The nemesis system is a fun innovative mechanic that makes the world feel alive. Unfortunately, it takes up everything of the game, not that it's bad but the story and especially the villains are badly executed. You're introduced to the villains at the beginning and then it takes half the game to reach one of them as a boss and none of those boss battles are interesting.

However, the nemesis system is well enough implemented and fun to waist time with, Yu'd want to get through the story to just play with the system. When you can brand, threaten and kill captains, that's when you've reached the games full potential.

The story is very ""not good"" is the only way I can put it, not bad at all the first half of the game but bosses aren't as interesting as the captains or warchiefs, which says alot. The characters are ""appearently"" well based on the books of Tolkien which you notice since they fit so well together in the world that they're in.

Wonderfully put together world, many open world games seems to fall flat on the ""second"" world, as the likes of Far Cry 3 where the second island is very pale compared to the first. Shadow of Mordor however gets a more beautiful and interesting second world with new stories to tell and nice locations to visit.

Great game overall which you'll have a blast with and maybe find a captain that you like so much you help him reach the top of his ranks. Create bonds with your captains, you'll never know when you find the right one."
The_Game_Doctor,"Oct 25, 2014",8,"As far as Lord of the Rings games go, this is the top of the pyramid.

As far as games in general goes, it brings very little new to the table. The game is a solid Action-adventure game. The scenery is not overly varied, but more out of necessity of the source material rather than lack of ingenuity.

The fighting mechanics are borrowed from the Batman: Arkham series, while the movement mechanics are reminiscent of the Assassin's Creed games. The being said. This is markedly not either one of those games, and it doesn't try to be. It spices in the RPG elements of its core inspiration while basing it in the rich LOTR universe.

That being said, the mechanics base themselves on some of the most successful franchises in recent gaming. Because of that, it allows the real star of the game to shine. The star of the game is the Nemesis system. Something many more games should have. Te game itself is a construct built around the experience of the Nemesis system. At its surface, it is simple. You kill an Uruk, the tide of Sauron's army shifts. Simple. But the reactions to your actions have a much deeper affect on the game. This is a game that is meant to be enjoyed and the nemesis system is there to be manipulated and exploited.

Sadly, the story seems more of a necessary evil to the extravagance of the game. A construct within which the beating heart of the game exists. As you evolve through the game, honing your gameplay styles, perfecting how the game is played, the story pushes you along and opens up more abilities to be used. The fact that several of the abilities are locked until you reach that specific story mission is almost a shame. I found myself getting much more enjoyment of playing through the shifting army than the story.  Don't get my wrong, the story isn't bad, but it is a normal, no surprises revenge plot. It is paced extraordinarily well, but just not the most interesting item in the game.

Several people complain that the game is nothing but a button masher, and the combat is a sad excuse for an action game. This can be played, poorly, as a button masher, but it is far from the only way that it can be played. There is enough variation in your skill trees to enjoy the different ways you can creatively approach every situation.

The game shares elements with successful and well known franchises, and because of this, people are claiming it is a rip-off. This is certainly not the case. If you go into this game expecting a good action-adventure game, you won't be disappointed. If you are going into it looking for something completely new, you won't enjoy the game for what it is.

This game is good. Not perfect. But good."
zezosk,"Oct 24, 2014",10,"The game is a complete beast, the most likable thing about it is its smooth gameplay. it takes the open world trait form GtA v and scales it down, and it takes the assassin's creed freedom and triples it because it makes you do what you want to do, and finally it takes the batman arkham series's fighting perfection so that with each strike of the sword you get the satisfaction you need."

lexsteryo,"Oct 23, 2014",7,"I've never been a huge fan of LOTR but I am always excited for a medieval based game. The combat system works amazing, when it WORKS, that's probably the biggest issue I have with this game. There are times when you are required to hit ""X"", and end up getting hit, or you dodge an attack end up against a wall, only to attempt to climb when you are hit, and end up dying to bad controls. The open world is very repetitive, and you continue running into respawning orcs, over and over and over again. Now I know I have talked about a lot of bad things in this game, put those issues aside and you are left with a great looking and great sounding game. Its the simple gameplay that will leave you asking for more after about 7 hours which is where I'm at."
Zbox,"Oct 23, 2014",9,"0,1,2.4's.................. so many trolls here, obviously either didn't even played the game, or using pirated copy (along with all the issues of being pirated) or just losers with too much free time. This game have minor issues, but nothing serious. story is very focus and the game is very rich with lore, combining batman with assassins creed to a whole new level of gameplay, pretty open world, dynamic events and characters, rpg elements and so much content packed. this game is a serious contender for the Game of the year. sadly due to trolls spaming around and haters, this will be another sleeper hit like sleeping dogs, making people buying overhyped trash (driveclub,destiny,etc) over genuine good games like this one."
headtrainborn,"Oct 23, 2014",8,"This game performed well above my expectations. I thought it looked like an assassins creed rip off, and I wasn't even going to pick it up. This game is fun to play and a challenge at times. The story holds my interest. I don't regret purchasing it unlike some other games lately."
dj_cole,"Oct 21, 2014",8,"Shadow of Mordor could be epic, and most of the time feels like its heading in that direction, but then....just isn't. The game does a lot of things right, and a lot of things that other games don't do. To judge a book by its cover Shadow of Mordor looks great, and once you dive in it is great. However, the game is held back later on by a lack of impact and replayability.

Shadow of Mordor looks great. I wasn't blown away by the technical prowess of the graphics, but everything looks sharp. The character models are well done, combat animations are fun to watch and the world looks, for the most part, realistic. The blood and guts gore adds to the oppressive tones of the title, though does go a bit far. Its only the second time my wife has asked me not to play a game in front of her (the other being the original The Darkness). There are plenty of games out there I wouldn't play in front of children, but there are far fewer I wouldn't feel comfortable playing with other adults around, and this one crosses that line at times. The gore isn't sadistic nor necessarily over the top, but it is frequent and bloody. The voice acting and sound are solid and add to the experience. There were no characters or enemies that sounded out of place or had poor acting, and the main cast was solid from start to finish. Overall, a solid start to finish presentation that won't blow you away, unless you love seeing gore, but has a high floor that doesn't disappoint.

The gameplay is where the game shines. The combat is fun, fluid and gets better as you level up so it doesn't stagnate. I would compare the gameplay favorably to the Batman Arkham series (which I enjoy) but my friends equate it to the Assassin's Creed games (which they enjoy). As you level you gain a sense of power slowly but surely. Where a few weak enemies early in the game would quickly kill you, by the end of the game you are able to easily dispatch even the most powerful enemies you come across. The world is easy to navigate and rarely becomes frustrating, save for the times you want to just get a certain collectible but have to cut through a horde of enemies to collect it. The stealth is fun, if a bit clunky. Once you figure the system out it becomes simple to stealth through areas sniping enemies with the bow, but there's always that sense of suspense as a horde of enemies can come crashing down if you make a wrong move. The minigames are varied and fun, ranging from stealth assassinations to last stand type situations with your bow to freeing prisoners through whatever means are available. They can become frustrating later on in the game as there are no checkpoints, so if you fail you have to start over. This can be even worse for the stealth minigames as you can make a mistake so easily.

This may be a small spoiler, but to anyone who has watched a trailer for the game you will know the end goal of the game is army building. To take over Sauron's army by controlling their minds and turning them against him. This was what made me want to play the game so badly. Be able to build an army and take it into combat. It's extremely fun and rewarding to find the captains you want and take control of them. You are then able to assist them on the missions they undertake, much like you are able to hinder enemy captains as they undertake missions. The problem is it doesn't really do you a lot of good. Yes, it's fun to get into a brawl and have an ally captain come with his small group of soldiers to aid you, but the problem is that it's not really all that useful. Captains will be where they are and you can't command them anywhere else. And the commands you can give them are very limited and don't allow for a lot of strategy beyond trying to position captains you control to become a warchief. Once they are warchiefs they become slightly more useful, but only as a means to kill off enemy captains. The one really annoying hiccup I did run into with the system was if you control enough captains the game feels hollow, as there aren't anything besides basic enemies to fight and not a lot to do with the captains you do control. Army building is extremely fun and rewarding until you realize that it's not really all that useful in the grand scheme of the game, though by that point you'll be powerful enough to rip through any enemy that comes across you. You have an army, which is fun, but it's an army that just wanders around.

Shadow of Mordor is fun, rewarding and does a lot of things right. The floor is high as everything is done well. Unfortunately there are enough issues to keep the game from being epic. I would equate Shadow of Mordor to a book that draws you in, makes you want to keep going, makes you invested in the characters and then just....kind of peters out. The game is spent doing a lot of fun things, that make you invested in what's going on, only to surprise by just kind of ending without great resolution or impact."
unluckydice,"Oct 21, 2014",8,"Fans and non fans of LOTR will enjoy this game due to its familiar mix of Assassins Creed and Batman Arkham City gameplay and mechanics all generated into a live flourishing world of middle earth with various intimidating Orcs full of dread and hate among many other enemy's, but what makes Shadow of Mordor unique from the bunch is it's Nemesis System (otherwise it would have been just another clone in my opinion) (think of it like a game of chess very difficult chess) side note (what i enjoyed the most was finding the artifacts (all voice spoken) and learning more about the lore of the game) (few faults were the main protagonist voice and story were a tad weak, killing orc captains got repetitive)"
radamanthys,"Oct 19, 2014",10,"this game is just : awesome !!!! i don´t think that deserves a 1010 but  in a year of so much weak new games for this new generation that were so coward to bring new experiences for gaming , this one does his best in many aspects , and its a must for every tolkien fan so c'mon lets play a real great game of this mythology"
Squeezit,"Oct 19, 2014",8,"Admittedly a perfect score is something I would probably never give any game because I can always find something that needs improvement.  Shadow of Mordor is no exception to that rule. However Shadows of Mordor, while it had a slow start for me, was a fantastic game.
Story 7/10
Graphics 9/10
gameplay 8/10

Overall, I absolutely loved the game and really hope for a sequel."
djrussell,"Oct 19, 2014",9,"I really enjoyed this game, its everything I hoped it would be when first seeing it. The gameplay is reminiscent of Assassins Creed (free-roam, free-climbing) and Batman Arkham Asylum (combat), but it very much feels different. Even when you're completely leveled up its still possible to swamped by so many Orcs that even as a badass ranger you never truly feel safe in Mordor, this is especially true at the beginning of the game. The story was also really good as well, although at times it felt a bit thrown together (you can approach certain missions in whatever order you want, so branching side-stories can feel lost in the overall narrative). My only major gripe is that after the campaign is finished the side missions (archer, sword, dagger and outcast missions) dont have enough variety to sustain 5-10hrs of grinding. It would have been good if cut-scene side-missions were available or the side-missions already in place had more variety and better objectives."
Hamburgl3r,"Oct 19, 2014",7,"(Scroll to bottom for summary) This game overall its a fun game. Unfortunately this game's gameplay is just a copy and paste of other games, except buggier and less polished.. It is just uncanny that the entirety of the Batman Arkham's combat is in this game, from the basic punches, counters, and stuns, to the entire upgradable tier list. The same can be said for other features which either come from assassins creed, or batman. At least those were some of the best mechanics. So if you are fine with the game having a few bugs, and playing some mechanics you may have played before, you might find this more enjoyable than me.

The map is very populated, and is structured well for the mechanics in this game. Their are fast travel points and ""strongholds"" where many enemies reside. The map ended up being a very good one, but I did have a couple problems. The few problems I had were: the respawn of enemies was almost instant after you cleared them out, leaving no time to escape/recover. :the other problem was that it did feel a bit small.

The good news its there are lots of things to do. There are the main missions, that last around 12 hours, and the side missions in each area, and the power mission to do as well. After that there is also so much more to do with the Orc captains and War chiefs.

Moving on to the story. Mostly Spoiler free. The story doesn't make a whole lot of sense explaining the main plot, but it has its moments of shock, or reward. The game creates a few new characters some fairly memorable. If you are a huge LOTR fan, you may find some references laughable, and others you might find  cool. For example the game does end up make decent use of gollum.

The one interesting new feature that stuck out was the captains/warlords feature. There are specific characters you can hunt/manipulate in game to kill off/ kill to build the Orc army leaders in your image. This ended up being one of my favorite features.

-slightly more buggy copy and paste mechanics
-copy and paste mechanics were at least from great ones.
-few new fun features
-an okay story
-populated well done map(little small)
-Lots to do
7/10"

Kal-Hell,"Oct 19, 2014",9,"We who love LotR have been burned before by the promise of Tolkien gaming bliss, WBIE have finally delivered. Even if you aren't a fan of LotR you'll enjoy the Arkham-like combat system, the Nemesis system, and cutting an Orcs head off. I put this game down for a week to play Alien: Isolation and when I came back I thought the new-game-rush would have warn off, I was wrong. It's just a joy to play. The story isn't all that but this is a game you will want to come back to time and time again."
Rodistar,"Oct 19, 2014",7,[SPOILER ALERT: This review contains spoilers.]
VGReviwer,"Oct 19, 2014",8,"Shadow of Mordor is an innovative addition to the open world genre. In an industry filled with games that are rehashed,  re-skinned versions of their respective games before them, it is great to see something fresh in gaming. The nemesis system makes the game. The countless scenarios that i created with rival orcs is always dynamic. Its the part of this game that sets it apart from others and is worth getting just to experience it. The game does however have some flaws that keep it from being recognized as a 10/10 game. First off, what the game does right.

While the maps are smaller than I'm used to, they are well designed, especially in the main orc strongholds which offer you so many ways to go about your mission. In the game their are 3 main ways to progress in a mission. You can go in sword swinging and catching the orcs off guard (though I'd advise against it in early levels, This game is no walk in the park for noobs), You could slip past like a shadow through stealth (which you must use in this game, or prepare to die) or you could play tactically be distracting enemies, drawing in the beasts of the wild, secretly branding and controlling enemy soldiers before you launch an attack( which is always fun when it comes together in your assault) or scaring the living **** out of your enemies with the always helpful morgul flies.
The combat system itself is like a hybrid of assassins creed and Batman Arkham series, with each present at all the right levels. Its so satisfying when you finally decapitate your arch nemesis after he has killed you 500 times and is basically immune to any strategy. The graphics on the ps4 are great and really stand out however a bit more variation in the environment would have been appreciated
The collectibles in the game are... descent. The artifacts are like an audio log mixed with an actual object (memory reading, the game explains it). While sometimes the objects are somewhat bland, the memory almost always interesting and the artifacts add to the vast lore of J.R.R Tolkien.

Now for the negatives. The games story, while interesting at first, never gets really engaging except for the plot twist in the end, no spoiling. The characters are okay and not that interesting. I feel like i would have become more invested in Talion if they had shown more of his memories through other collectables or something like that. The boss fight with the black hand are the games weakest points, they are not challenging and really scripted for this game. The last one was the biggest disappointment. Their was so much potential for an epic clash that would rival that of Dark Souls. Instead, we get a quick time event. Which is such a shame, seeing how many random encounters have felt like epic boss fights. Another thing this game needed from dark souls was greater difficulty, for late game i mean. Once you've played the game for about 8 to 10 hours, it becomes really easy, with no way to increase the difficulty.

In spite of the flaws, the game is a great piece of work from monolith, a developer who has now earned my respect. If the story had been better and if the story boss fight were more interesting then I would have give this game a full 10 out of 10. But for a now I give it 8. However it is the best lotr game made and if you are a fan the franchise or you feel like you want to try something , it is a must buy. I hope the sequel is just as innovative."
St4rk,"Oct 19, 2014",10,"By far my favourite PS4 game I have played since launch. A real jewel in the rough and a must play game for any fan of the sandbox/open world genre. Even if you aren't a fan of the LotR franchise this is a must own, form combat to graphics and scenery this game is just amazing. They've taken so many element of other games, Batman and Assassins Creed and perfected it and not to mention the nemesis system which works so well and really adds some depth to the game. So far my no 1 for game of the year and there are only a handful of other titles I'd say can compete this year."
Grassrafiki,"Oct 18, 2014",6,"Good game and worth a look. Mechanics are polished and top notch. Graphics are decent but nothing special for next gen. Story is non existent which really hurts the game.
There is little motivation to progress other than the sake to progress. You spend all your time going from one interest point on your map to the next interest point on your map with little sense of purpose"
Ryhelia,"Oct 18, 2014",10,"Game should be an 8.5 or 9, but I give it a 10 to balance out these ridiculously low scores of 1,2 and 0.  To the couple people complaining about ""****'s  just not true.  I have 40+ hours so far and the game is smooth as silk.  I spoke with a few friends who have been playing this for 3 solid weeks and they haven't seen a single bug either.  As far as the other super low scores....I don't know. ..just bitter trolls I guess.

This game is loads of fun great graphics and super fun combat.  In my opinion the combat never gets old because there are so many different strategies you can take to approach your enemies.

As many others have **** game has elements of assassin's creed and Batman,  but it does what they do BETTER.  It also came up with this ""nemesis system"" and your enemies evolve and change depending on how you play the game.  They have real memories.  Anyway, I could go on and on.  I'm having a blast with this game and so far it is my favorite game on the ps4"
flametail23,"Oct 18, 2014",9,"I thought this game was just going to be an Assassin's Creed clone, it's really not. I think this is even better than Assassin's Creed. I love this game, if you love LOTR or Middle Earth's past you will like this game. The nemisis system works amazingly and I love encountering Orks I have fought before to see what scars they have after the first battle we had.
9/10"
Wardrobechaos,"Oct 18, 2014",8,"Like that game a lot, its cool, stylish, super combat system, working interesting abilities that actually change how you play the game, I just think the main character is a bit flat and run of the mill, but the world is gorgeous and fits together well, maybe whats missing is towns or settlements to add a bit of peace into the hostile **** in all a great, polished game..."
Mistval,"Oct 17, 2014",8,"This is a competent but small open world game with some interesting innovations that hopefully will work their way into the video game industry at large.

Combat in this game is very fun and you get a heck of a lot of abilities. So many that sometimes using them is a little awkward, as you have to press two buttons at once or something. No big deal though. That's the price of having a lot of abilities. Stealth mechanics are pretty good and, indeed, quite Assassin's Creed like. If you've played that series you'll be right at home. Enemies can be ridiculously oblivious to you running around and killing their buddies, so it ain't no Splinter Cell, but that's probably for the best.

As far as being open-world, yes you can go anywhere and there's a lot of stuff to do, but don't expect the scale of, for example, an Elder Scrolls game. There aren't skills, there aren't cities, shops, no people you can really talk to, just some people in cutscenes and slaves that say a few words of thanks when you free them. The world is also pretty small, I was disappointed by how small it is. They pack a lot of stuff in, but you will see it all pretty quickly. By the ten hour mark I had unlocked all dozen-ish of the forge towers in the game (pretty much exactly the same thing as viewpoints in Assassin's Creed) and forged the legendary bow by finishing all the bow missions (ten, they take like two minutes each).

Nemesis system: a lot of people are talking this up, and rightfully so. This is the first current-gen game (I refuse to call PS4 and Xbone next gen anymore) I've played that does something that last gen couldn't. In a nutshell, orcs are also playing the game, trying to kill their enemies (including you) and get promoted to war chief while you play the game. Sometimes some orc you fought a while ago will show up and try to kill you at a really inconvenient time. But that's just payback for when you tried to kill him at a really inconvenient time. You can also take control of orcs by defeating them and order them to kill other orcs you don't like. And you can help them level up and get promoted to war chief.

Eventually this makes things too easy, though. If you control a war chief and there's some other orc you want to kill, you can just tell your war chief to help you kill the other war chief and you would have to try pretty hard to lose that fight.

So the Nemesis system is not perfect but it is definitely fresh and interesting and there is a lot of potential in the concept. Hopefully other games will follow in Mordor's footsteps by giving NPCs more soul. Mordor is just the beginning of the trend, and other games can hone and refine it."
TheWillydog,"Oct 17, 2014",2,"I bought this game because it got such a high rating and I saw the words RPG and ADVENTURE in a review, I got bored of this game very quickly, fighting mechanics were familiar and gameplay felt repetitive. Kill orc, kill orc, kill orc, no roleplaying or adventure, just find an orc and slash.... repeat over and over.
I took the game back to EB games a day later for a refund and I haven't done that in years.
I suggest you hire before you buy if you're looking for an rpg or adventure because this is just button mashing action."
Matodox,"Oct 17, 2014",7,"The gameplay is really smooth. It features the combat system we were introduced with, by the ""Arkham Asylum"" series of Batman games, and it just really works well, better than i thought it would in a fantasy RPG game. I love the violence in here! It's so damn bloody, but you feel awesome when you finish off an orc and cap his head of with your finishing moves! The ability system is also a great add-on, there's a good variety of powers to choose from. There's also runes that you can use to upgrade your weapons. Personally i think it would've been better, if you could just change your weapons. The story line is also surprisingly good and interesting. I mean, no points for originality here, but it does what it's supposed to do, keep you hooked on from beginning to end and doesn't feel like it's just a money maker like most expanded universe stories. And the nemesis system is just freakin' awesome!!! And i love when you attack a captain or warchief you get to confront them just before you decapitate their ass. The only things disappointing about it, is that the game is too short. The main story is completed in like a day or two (depending how much you play in a day) but around 20-25 hours. Then you got the side missions, which are okay but a little repetitive after a while. And the world is just not big enough. And i was greatly disappointed by the final boss battles. The only ""superboss"" you really get to fight are the Hammer of Sauron, while both the Tower and the Black Hand are ridiculously easy, like just a matter of pressing the right buttons at the right time or sneaking up behind 'em and drain them. Also i hate that you can't jump when you're climbing if there isn't any ledge or platform that you can leap towards, like in Assassin's Creed, you can jump anywhere even if it means you will die or loose a lot of health. It get's really annoying when you accidentally climb onto something and you need to get down quick but you just have to let go and press and hold the circle button, or else he will grab onto it again. Despite it's flaws, it's a great experience and has decent graphics."
Maeglin,"Oct 17, 2014",8,"Even though it shares many similarities with Assassins creed or the batman franchise the game provides it's own experience. After so many failed Lotr titles this game provides an interesting story line and a rather unique insight in Mordor.

The combat system is easy to learn but difficult to master. The camera might sometimes be a little off but never to an annoying point or that it hampers your view or fighting ability.

And even though anything but the main missions is repetitive (kill uruks, free slaves, kill warchiefs) there is a certain addiction to doing the challenges, duels and interrupting a recruitment attempt by Uruk warchiefs. Especially when things get personal (they have killed you and brag about it, throw insults at you or run away to fight you another time) it is very satisfying to walk across half of Mordor to get that bastard and finish him off. The sheer hatred you feel when a cowardly warchief stabs you every time in the back when you are already in a fight and kills you for the 3th time that way (all the while growing in power) I have not experienced before.
The abilities work all very well and give you more options to make a battle a whole spectacle.

I just had hoped there would be a bit more diversity in your enemies/world, like Haradrim or Easterlings. Maybe that will be something for expansions? And my worry is that when you are fully levelled up you become a bit to godlike which takes away the thrill of the fight or hunt.

My only complaint is that not everything is explained very well. You learn the most from doing immediately the main missions but somehow they throw you out there in the open world without much explaining."
WarX,"Oct 17, 2014",9,"Best Lord of the Rings themed in recent times.
Yes it have AC elements, but it's not a rip off, they have improved the formula. And the AC fan boys dont understand that."
Zafeer,"Oct 16, 2014",9,So entertaining I played every spare minute until I completed the game.  I can't say that about very many games.  Excellent combat and an interesting story that stays within the lore but doesn't feel mired in it.
MasiTronXIII,"Oct 15, 2014",9,"I didn't know much about Shadow of Mordor going into it, but when you get started, this game simply feels incredible, running around Mordor in itself on next gen machines looks fantastic. The combat system is reminiscent of the Arkham combat systems, but this time you can brutally murder things, making it a step up in my opinion. The biggest knock on this game is it can get a bit repetitive sometimes. If you are a Lord of the rings fan, or a fan of the Arkham series, like myself, you will probably love this game. It's smooth and beautiful and a great step up on the next gen consoles. The nemesis system is incredible, within 2 hours I had been killed 6 times by one foolish uruk who made his way up the ranks, eventually I got revenge, only for him to come back with a face wound and for our battle to continue. It creates small stories and power struggles within the game and I absolutely love it. Overall Shadow of Mordor is an incredibly fun experience, though it is not without flaw and so much more could be done with it, I would highly recommend it. I look forward to more games following in the footsteps of this one"
Deschain89,"Oct 15, 2014",6,"What happens when Ass Creed has butt sex with Arkham Assylum? ASS.

And now that this is out of the way, on to the review.

The story is straight up Hollywood panderism: Troubled protagonist who was the perfect father/husband, looses all, and now is out there to get revenge: partnered with an unlikely, quirky ally, and this time it's personal. It's a buddy cop movie, but with Gollum thrown in the mix. Remember Gollum guys? You people loved him in the movies! He is a ticked seller, that good old potato headed hobbit.

Gameplay wise, You run and jump just like in Assassins Creed, you even have eagle vision and the tower system; and then you fight  and mash buttons just like in Arkham Asylum. The only original fart coming from this ass meet up is the original ""do not steal"" nemesis system, in which you will fight Uruk Ay Lmaos named Pug the furry or something, cut his head twice, and he will still come back to call you a pig and to check your privilege.

Trully amazing.

I give it a weekend from purchase to lose your interest, pick it up second hand for a nickel and a BJ."
aadms,"Oct 15, 2014",8,"This game does justice to Tolkien's world.  Without going into deep narrative, many items are found and characters are met throughout Mordor that tells the Silmarillion up to the events beginning The Lord of the Ring.  The characters aren't top-notch realistic, yet the graphics, animation look great, especially in 1080p.  The combat is more like Batman than like AC, although it does borrow AC's scaling walls as well as the rooftop strikes, but you level up your combat combos and skills like the Batman Arkham games.  But, this game goes beyond what Batman offers in the combat scheme as the addition of ""Wraith"" skills makes combat something incredible to see once you get all the nuances down.  The ""nemesis"" system is an awesome innovation that I would love to see more open world games utilize.  I found myself getting caught up more in cleaning out orc strongholds and bending a makeshift army to my will, then searching out the story line in this open world. Sadly, while there is an emotional charged story, with both Tailon and Celebrimbor as your duel protagonists, it never really comes across compelling enough to get caught up in.  Such as shame, because the voice acting and animations are very well done.  And the last sad thing about this game is the final end battles with Sauron's servants that were very anti-climatically done.  Think Tomb Raiders last game disappointing boss battle.  But even with those issues,  I found myself engrossed in the world of Mordor and quite a willing participant to rid Middle Earth of orcs in flourishing style."
herrmoekl,"Oct 15, 2014",6,"This game could have been much better. Adapted Gameplay Elements from Batman and AC feel good (except for the climbing) and the finishers here are even more fun than in batman as they are very violent. I also like the RPG Elements they integrated. Leveling up and getting better moves and runes makes you feel stronger and is necessary against strong enemies. And of course the nemesis system is great. Hopefully they will improve on the good basics in the future. The worst thing for me was the Unsightly Open World with only slaves and orcs in it. There are no villages with people or anything like that. I don´t enjoy spending any time in this world except for making the missions. There is nothing really to explore as the Elements in this sandbox are very repetitive and almost everything looks just brown and grey. Also i didn´t really have the feeling that gameplay and story was well combined. When i played missions i didn´t have the feeling to play a story. It was kind of separated from another. (Maybe im spoiled with this since The Last of Us)

Pros:

- Nemesis System
- RPG Elements and Feeling more and more Powerful when leveling up

Conts:

- Repetitive and Unsightly Open World
- Story and Gameplay are a bit separated from another
- Monotonous Go from A to B Leveldesign
- Climbing"
Fataudama,"Oct 15, 2014",6,"Good: Nemesis system is a great concept. Future PvE games in the industry will look back at this game and expand on this. Lord of the rings world! Just plain fun and gory.

Bad: OVER HYPED! no difficulty setting so hardcore gamers will be bored fast. repetitive combat, weak RPG elements

overall: RENT IT! its worth playing but you can finish it quickly. Replay-ability is weak despite being an open world game."
ghamed,"Oct 15, 2014",10,"Fantastic fun, great combat, great story ;Story is really not bad of boring  I can't find anything negative about this game so I'll give it a 10/10

SaidenStorm,"Oct 14, 2014",6,"SOM starts off strong with its story and begining tutorial section but quickly fades into mediocre combat, forced play style encounters, unlimited enemy in combat respawns, fighting with your camera and down right frustration at the very shortsighted and limiting streangths vs weakness system that by the end of the game is just plain out infuriating when you run into almost nothing but enemies with 100% immunity to everything your able to do with only 1 weakness its especially annoying when that weakness is something like fear of XXX then you have to go this this annoy as #%^$ scanvenger hunt for XXX bring it back to where ever your target is in which case the run away then you have to chase an vastly faster moving then yourself enemy through their forces where it seems 90% of the time he gets away and you now have to start completely over !!!

Strengths:
Story

Base gameplay (a mix of assassin's creed platforming and Batman combat)

Weaknesses:
Skills are unlocked based on main story missions forcing you to play as a jack of all trades which I guess was a side effect of the poorly though out invulnerability/weakness system.

Very bad camera that you will spend a lot of time fighting against when it tries to keep combat onscreen even when your trying to run away and hide often time ending in your death because you can not see where you are running.

Very bad Ranged aiming where it often accelerates and slows down forcing you to have to spend precious time adjusting your aim fighting with a system that is fighting against you.

Unlimited respawn of enemies while in combat, there are times when I was in a fight and had to kill the exact same captain 3 times because the respawn was soo damn short he died and repopped before I was even down killing the enemies around him its obscenely bad.

And then there are the major story boss fights I do not want to give anything away but these are by far and away the worst designed boss fights I have seen since Resident Evil 6's QTE bosses and often times they are very similar."
Barefoot_Gamer,"Oct 14, 2014",7,I was expecting a lot from this game and really looking forward to the open world roaming around middle earth. The game for me is too repetitive. A great idea where the Nemesis system is concerned but overall the game is way too repetitive. Good story but lacking in gameplay ideas. Enjoyable for the first few hours and then the fun begins to wear thin. A little disappointed.

UShallntPASS,"Oct 13, 2014",8,"Daring really from Monolith to come with another game from the consecrated Lord of the Rings series, but without bigger complications, Monolith developed a great and indefatigable hack'n slash game, with a superb story, meanwhile some mechanics that seems to be good working at the first view may be just problematic after 5 or 6 hours of gameplay, as well as the map, a map that no, the fast taveling points weren't able to save it this time, the traveling in the game is slow and repetitive.

But boreless combat, fluid and frantic, it can give you lots of fun for a long time, without leaving a missing air in the story, I can't forgot to mention the graphics, gorgeours to say less, an easy 80/100 game."
yogurtspy,"Oct 13, 2014",9,"I've given this a 9. It would have been a 10 but I think the difficulty at the start can make it a touch frustrating for a new player, and the tutorials could have explained the combat systems a bit better. It borrows heavily from AC and the Batman games, but why not? SoM adds in new elements that make it an awesome game which will make you want to throw the controller at the TV, but also have you dancing round the room with glee when you finally kill that orc that has been killing you over and over again the last week. Looks and place great on the PS4."

nms1215,"Oct 12, 2014",8,"Story: While not canon, this story explores a grey area in the mythology and proposes an interesting turn of events that are not to be expected by LOTR fans, but still appreciated. I love the LOTR lore, and this did nothing but interest me. I was not yelling at how it may contradict the lore, I was interested at how this provides a different take. I will leave it at that to avoid spoilers. The story is not in your face, but carefully in the background, allowing you to explore your two main characters while progressing further. The true fun is in the nemesis system.

Gameplay: This game plays just like the Batman Arkham games, with a smooth free-flow combat system based around achieving combos and using various abilities. However, the nemesis system adds a whole new dimension to this game. Each uruk is unique--even the lowly grunts. Each one has the potential to rise and fall (die) in the ranks, develop new traits (weaknesses, strengths, etc.) based on their experiences, and also be your tool of manipulation. The real fun is choosing uruks that you enjoy and dominating them--this allows you to begin building your own line of uruks, having them train and gain power, get close to your target, or strike at other uruk leaders. If you like the combat of the Batman Arkham games, you will enjoy this combat, which includes the excellent gore and crude violence missing from Batman, as well as some great differences to make it its own.

Graphics: While I felt like the main character (Talion) had a weird appearance to his face, you are usually over his shoulder so it is not often in view. Everything else looks fantastic. Not quite up to the current-gen standard, but clearly at the cross-gen peak.

This game is a whole lot of fun. While the story may be short, the nemesis system offers endless hours of coming back and manipulating the ranks of your enemies.

P.S. Some of these orcs will freak your out! One just kept breathing heavily in my face and it was creepy as hell!"

mrshoes74,"Oct 12, 2014",10,"As a huge fan of the LOTR movies I waited eagerly for this release, I was not disappointed.
To me the game just oozes quality and refreshing gameplay in a world where we are surrounded FPS games. I'll be honest the game wont win any awards for the story but the whole feel of the game is very much in LOTR universe and again another top class performance from Troy Baker who seems that every game he works on is pure gold. The gameplay is excellent and although elements have been taken from Assassins Creed and Batman Shadow of Mordor  uses all these ability's with a fresh approach. The combat system is excellent and there is nothing more rewarding than decapitating an orc and watching his fellow soldiers running to the hills in shock and dismay.. A mention has to go to the Nemesis system which a totally new experience and is constantly in the back ground. You take down a captain then another orc is promoted they may get to war chief only to be beheaded in the future. The graphics are vibrant and detailed and always a joy to look at. The soundtrack is very reminiscent to the films and any LOTR fan would be mad to miss this masterpiece. Hats off to Monolith ..Bravo...Looking forward to future DLC...."
vinnykin,"Oct 12, 2014",9,"The sign **** game is when you notice the sun coming up and your still playing! I was hooked for 3 days on this game and played to 100% completion with 80% trophy's. The combat, movement and game mechanics are brilliant and the nemesis system was a nice surprise........however the end of the story was a bit of a let down and by the time you have hit 25 hours of gameplay and unlocked all the abilities you will be so proficient at killing orcs and leaders that the game becomes stale. the 30 hours are so fun though and well worth the money. will probably play it again right through in a few months"
FreezingProgram,"Oct 12, 2014",6,"Awesome game, very gory, addictive RPG. The gameplay is not new to consoles though. I think of this game as ""Chivalry Of The Rings"". Since it is the same as all of the Lord Of The Rings games, and has the same gameplay as Chivalry Medieval Warfare.

I don't understand how this got a higher score then Destiny... (I am not a Destiny Fanboy)"
MalistiX,"Oct 12, 2014",9,"I gotto say if you love action games or like them and love LOTR you will find much to enjoy here. The combat is great and that is where the game shines, killing orcs in all kinds of fashion with a solid and good voice acted cast that give this title some real good atmosphere and you will find much to love."
velvetmeds,"Oct 12, 2014",0,"This game is incredibly overrated, wtf are reviewers and users thinking? The game has good fighting/combat, though even that is entirely ripped off of Batman Arkham (which still does it better than this game), everything else is a yawn fest. Bland, empty, lifeless open world which is a chore to travel through, boring story, lots of useless padding of the kind that you find in many Ubisoft games... damn. This game would have been a lot better with a more tight, focused experience instead of trying to do many things and artificially increasing play time. But i guess this is what gamers want nowadays, doesn't matter if it's boring or not, they just want it to take hours to play through. Quantity over quality mentality...which i disagree with."

davecave23,"Oct 12, 2014",9,"This game is not just a great Lord of the Rings game, but a great game in general that repeats its lore and roots. Many will say that the game is similar to the Arkham and assassins creed games and to that I say.... so thats awesome! its story is a bit generic but theres a good host of side characters and it should keep you sufficiently engaged for the duration of the 12 hour campaign. Get this game NOW!"
Kenmei,"Oct 11, 2014",7,"While the game itself is very fun, alot of the outlying elements really drag this Assassin's Creed/Batman clone down. While it's still a great overall experience, it's certainly not going to stand the test of time.
The gameplay itself is the star here with the combat system, a clone of the Batman: Arkham games, with the parkour elements from the Assassin's Creed games. What stands out is the Nemesis sytem, where you can hunt down and kill, or later on in the game, mind control them, Orcs. It's very fun and it's something I've never played before. That's what took up the bulk of my game time. Doing the side missions where you hunt them down and figure out a way to kill them is easily the best part of the game no questions asked. While the difficulty spikes if you run into an Orc with a special blend of strengths, there's no better thrill than to run into a stronghold and take down 100 guys before you fight a captain.
The bad with this game starts with the graphics. While they aren't bad in some spots, in others they are absolutely terrible. The hair effects on the main character are PS2 worthy, and some of the other spots here and there are just absolutely terrible. The story is also terrible. While I commend them for trying to get away from the Lord of the Rings franchise and create a game based on Middle Earth itself, it failed miserably in the story department and decent performances by Troy Baker and the rest of the cast did nothing to save a terrible script. The ""final battle"" was super dull and I feel cheated a bit with how it ended. I haven't felt this cheated by a story since Mass Effect.
There are other things that are bad including the camera and clipping stuff in the world but all these things combined don't hurt the experience too much. I feel like this is a good game that just was horribly crippled by the story and graphics. I like that they wanted to set themselves apart but they failed miserably and, that's too bad, cause there is major potential here for a decent franchise going forward. They really need to brush up the story before anything else happens though."
Jim222001,"Oct 11, 2014",10,This game is awesome and they need more like it. I love that once an orc kills you; that orc becomes an enemy of yours and even remembers you every time you bump into them. The game can be hard but it's awesome nevertheless.
Joelony,"Oct 11, 2014",8,"There are few other ""licensed"" games that actually play well and deserve a great score; this game is one of them. Is it perfect? No. Does it get a little bit repetitive? Yes. Even after the 100th Uruk Captain kill is it still satisfying? H*LL YES!

The game features a satisfying and fairly long campaign, with some time trials and leaderboard driven tasks to keep you playing after you beat the game. Those modes are similar to the Batman: Arkham series of games. No surprise, since WB Games published ME: Shadow of Mordor.

I must point out however, that while at times it feels like Lord of the Rings, other times it doesn't. In fact, the game could easily drop the Lord of the Rings licensing and still stand on it's own merit for delivering an Assassin's Creed style clone that actually plays really well. In fact, the combat is oftentimes more enjoyable than it ever was in AC.

I must suggest that if you do play this game, don't get sidetracked by how fun it is to just kill stuff. Get through missions since it unlocks more content. I realized I had maxed out my RPG style upgrades and novelists pretty early. While this makes you feel like a demigod, or should I say demiwraith, when you can absolutely wreck a small army of Uruks (30+ enemies at a time) it makes missions an absolute snoozy breeze. I was still being taught ""core game mechanics"" in some missions and my abilities were mostly maxed out.

The bad: Some of the animations and gameplay are downright wonky. Climbing can be frustrating and clumsy and some animations and move sets are not as fluid as Assassin's Creed or nonexistent altogether. For example, sidling a wall is really clunky, if you aren't perfectly lined up your character will oftentimes refuse to climb, and there is no way to jump from one ledge to another while hanging (unless it is close enough behind you then it gives an R1 prompt).

Also, as much as I don't like comparing it to Assassin's Creed, it's hard not to notice the similarities. Graphics are much better than Black Flag, obviously, but aspects like building up a base or a large supporting cast just aren't in this game. However, the supporting cast are the Uruk Captains that you fight and without spoiling too much for you, I was really impressed with how this game adapts to the decisions I made; whether that was fleeing a fight, dying, or using a particular method to dispatch a Captain this game does a great job of making them feel like real adversaries. While their motivation isn't too deep (they are dumb evil Orcs, after all) it's really satisfying to use their weaknesses against them and finally get rid of that thorn in your side.

I'd give this game an 8.7 or 8.8 if I could."
aqurban,"Oct 10, 2014",9,"It might hesitate to dive into the storytelling which it lacks, yet Talion's adventure might be best told in his battles against the merciless horde of Uruks. Taking down captains or petting them against one another to achieve his goals, deceiving them to become under his command or simply ending their lives certainly extends the experience into an endless but not linear number of stories. Shadow of Mordor does not shy when it comes to delivering a bloody and merciless combat experience and differently does not hide its incredible Nemesis system and its infinite capabilities."
Rylos77,"Oct 10, 2014",10,"After reading some of the user reviews for this game I have been left scratching my head. People who complain about only having one chance when it comes to the captains and such, obviously have no idea what the whole nemesis system is all about. this game is designed to make you stop and think before you take on some of the higher ranking uruks. And those who complain about there only being orcs to kill, i laugh and say, you do realize your in the lotr universe rite? were you expecting half naked faeries and cupcake s&*tting unicorns?. That being said, this game is a whole lot of fun. it has a bit of a learning  curve as we are not used to playing a game as clever as this. rushing in to a battle is a sure fire way to get killed and rank up the enemy. Not to mention that you may also be being hunted. the fear of thinking, its ok, im only taking on a level 5 captain, just to be ambushed by your rank 12 nemesis mid battle is very real. its a great game that manages to make your palms sweat when your about to die, forcing you ask yourself, would i rather flee and be called a coward by the orcs? ( and they do call you a coward ) or do i risk letting another captain level up making him tougher to defeat down the track?
This is a must play for those who crave a deep gaming experience, the rabbit hole is deep indeed with this one. Happy hunting."
Moonraver005,"Oct 10, 2014",10,This game fell off my radar for a while; but now that I've picked it up I have been pleasantly surprised. Truly enjoyable from the beginning and a nice addition to the Middle Earth Universe. I ask everyone to give it a shot.
MyRaceIsDoctor,"Oct 10, 2014",3,"visuals are nice and sometimes this game has epic moments where the fall of the game starts is the combat. its boring , reptive and really ruins the atmosphere of the game. the game is way to easy after a hour and a half the game is pretty much a cake walk and there is no difficulty slider which it needs cause its just to easy. the last boss battle last 30 seconds and is just a few quick time events which was extremely unforgivable after all the tension and ready to seek your revenge its a joke. i am glad i rented this because i got to say i was very disappointed. many orcs durring the times when you lead your army just seem ghost out and stand around when they are suppose to be killing other orcs which kills it for me since i was looking most forward to this game play element."
Flippy4212,"Oct 10, 2014",10,"Let Me set This Strait, its a great game, i only have one issue. I made the mistake in the begining of not knowing what to do. so i went off to kill uruks. i soon learned that the more you die to the same captain, the harder it gets to kill them. so now after an hour of messing around dieing its almost impossible for someone like me. But Beside From me Dieing To the Same Captain 40 Times Over. Its A really good game"
Northur,"Oct 10, 2014",9,"Fantastic Tolkien game. The Nemesis system is something that I would want to be in other games too. Combat is very similar to Batman Arkham series, which is a good thing.

WalterGirao,"Oct 10, 2014",6,"Combat flows well and the nemesis system is very enjoyable. This alone can make the game worth it for you.
Unfortunately, this is not enough for me. What I didn't like:

1- Camera is REALLY bad
2- Game feels unpolished with so many bugs
3- Enemy threats interrupt you mid combo and can get very annoying.
4- Main story is uninspired
5- The game doesn't feel like lord of the rings.
6- VERY rushed ending. last boss is only quick time events!
7- Characters are forgettable

I could go on but items 4, 5 and 7 alone are enough for me to not recommend this one."
ps4ftw,"Oct 9, 2014",8,Love the game love the combat system love the parcour does not feel like AC at all story is amazinging just dont like how easy it is to get over whelmed by enimies and i didnt like the ending but im happy
JohnnyBeGood,"Oct 9, 2014",10,"The game is absolutely incredible. I had heard it was great, but after about 3 hours, I wasn't feeling it. I was struggling with it at first. I honestly was disappointed. Then something suddenly clicked, and I absolutely love it. The combat is amazing. It's fluid, smooth, easy to learn, yet difficult to master. It's pretty much perfect. The upgrades are extensive (for both your character and your weapons. Nemesis system is really really really cool and if they don't put it in more games, I'll be disappointed. Newbies be warned, it's a pretty challenging game. It's certainly not easy. But it 's refreshing to see a game that makes challenges you and doesn't cater to thick-skulled neanderthals like games have been lately. The voice acting is absolutely top notch. Troy Baker's performance as Talion rivals his portrayal of Joel in TLoU. Every voice actor I've heard so far has done an outstanding job, especially the ones for Ratbag and Gollum (I had to look it up because apparently Andy Serkis didn't do Gollum; the man they got to fill his shoes did a spectacular job). You'd be dumb not to pick this game up. The graphics are amazing, the orc characters models look unreal, the environments look stunning.9.5/10 for sure, but I'll round up."

R7critical,"Oct 9, 2014",9,"Shadow of Mordor is a better assassin's creed game than any assassin's creed game.

I spent a good 4 hours as soon as the game started roaming around stabbing orcs in the back, having a grand ol' time murdering anything that moved and hunting down captains before I even bothered getting into the main missions.

The game really opens up and shows you it's true colors in the second half with the addition of the ""Brand"" ability which allows you to convert enemies into your followers. Suddenly a 30 on 1 brawl looks less like an impossible disaster and more like an opportunity.

The nemesis system is a lot of fun and I had many a ""Hey, I remember that guy!"" moment when a captain I killed came back with a metal eye-patch or a sack over his head screaming ""they call me bag head now!"" and with the brand power you can take control of those captains and ensure their rise in the ranks of Sauron's army, becoming a shadowy figure pulling their strings from behind a curtain as you lure your true foes out into the open and crush them with your army of carefully selected and trained up warchiefs.

The only real complaints I have are the fiddly controls near walls, getting stuck on them when you try to walk around them can be a little annoying, and climbing around on archer towers trying to drop into the middle space can also be irritating.
The lack of a smarter lock-on in combat means you'll end up combat-branding the same guy twice in a row and not him and his pal right next to him. There is no -hard- lock on either, so you have to contend with the soft lock on system and fiddly wiggle yourself around a bunch until the guy in the pack below you want to pounce on is lit up, this is especially a nuisance when the enemy has a group of bodyguards.

The story is about average length for games these days, and it ends on a modern movie style ""sequel coming!"" note.

It took about 3 solid days of playing to get ~most~ of the stuff in the game done, sidequests and all, I figure 4-5 days total if one were to try and platinum it AND just play the game.

In all I would give this game a solid 8.6 out of 10, but since I can't, it's getting a 9."
morningstar6969,"Oct 9, 2014",10,Reminds me a lot of a mix between the Batman and Assassin Creed series but with a lot of fresh new ideas. Best game I've played in a long time. Definately a owner.
Gamer_Guy,"Oct 8, 2014",9,"I was a little cautious with this purchase as i don't usually buy assassins creed or batman but i'm a huge fan of lord of the rings and the hobbit. But pleasantly to my suprise this game is amazing. Graphically, technically and story wise.

The nemesis system is brilliant. It's so refreshing to see developers add something new, unseen in any game today. Clearly this game borrows key elements from assassins creed and batman arkham series but does this in such a way it feels unique to the game.

i highly recommend this game to anyone interested. i will at least get 50-60 hours out of it. which is alot more than most single player games interest me these days."
sgtdegrandis,"Oct 8, 2014",8,"this games is tons of fun however the biggest flaws are the QTE final boss battles also the missions themselves are just tutorials which is ok but i wish there was more to them also the story was not very interesting.

now lets go to the goods first the combat is top notch you really feel like a complete badass also the killcam  that happens when you charge your attacks are pretty epic kinda reminds me of the movie ""300""

Nemesis System either works great or not at all what I mean is that my first play through I kept dying and the Orc that killed me leveled up to damn high and was untouchable but my  second play through was very different all the Orc were to weak and never leveled up past 10"

felt like bit like assassin creed but fact is it mad  i love Nemesis system it awesome  wraith  ability is cool just hope i get to control orc soon"
ernuk,"Oct 8, 2014",8,"The way I felt about this game during the playthrough was a bit of a rollercoaster. There were great ups and then there were bland downs.

I think the game is really bold in what it sets out to do. More often than not when you write a story within an already established world, you create new characters and tell their tales. I guess Talion and his story is exactly that, but everything else (and there's a plenty of that ""else"") goes hard on pre-established major characters. I can see why someone could be up in arms about the plot developement later in the game, but I don't really mind. The story overall was good, although I will say that some of the Main Missions didn't feel like Main Missions at all, and some of it just happened too quick.

The gameplay? It's Assassin's Creed with Batman's combat, which if you asked me, is a significantly improved Assassin's Creed. Of course, aside from the combat being very solid, there are also plenty of other special tricks you can pull off to help you murder orcs. This is all great, but the major issue I had here was that you learn all those combat moves and tricks too slowly. When you've learned the bulk of them, the game is nearing it's end. And some of those are what I'd call core abilities! While opening all abilities slowly and letting the player choose the order is fine, this is something I've seen happen in other games too. I thought I had much more fun with the combat and orc slaughter later in the game than in the beginning. But when it was fun, it was really fun.

The side missions and collectibles are alright. Or perhaps mediocre. There's an okay amount of them. What a lot of them do is add flavor to characters met during the main storyline, but those characters were only mentioned relatively briefly in the first place. I didn't really care reading more about them. ""Forging the legend"" of your weapons is a cool way to say ""combat""/""stealth""/""archery"" challenge. It's all fairly repetitive, but such is the nature of the beast.

It's an interesting thing that there's no difficulty slider. I think it could use one, but there's two sides to that coin. The game gets harder everytime you die or use fast travel, but if you only die rarely and don't use fast travel, it actually never gets really hard. And I found avoiding death isn't actually hard, since running away from fights is really easy. So really, depending on how you're doing, you might find yourself wanting to turn the difficulty either up or down.

All in all, if you liked either AC or Batman, you'll like this. If you'd like to play Orc Army Building Simulator, you're gonna love this. If you're a hardcore LotR fan, you probably think this one ruined LotR forever. If you're a casual fan, not so much."
Dukay66,"Oct 8, 2014",7,"Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a fun open world experience and a great ""Lord of the Rings"" game. It borrows from just about every game in the book; from Assassin's Creed to the Arkham series. That's not necessarily a bad thing, especially when they implement a mind blowing new mechanic call the nemesis system. I would say Shadow of Mordor does everything well enough and if it weren't for it's new next-gen nemesis mechanic, it would of turned out very mediocre. The good thing is that Warner Bros. and Interactive have created a sturdy foundation to start building a better sequel."
Vigilem,"Oct 8, 2014",8,"Shadow of Mordor is quite an ambitious action-RPG. The developers have taken quite a few risks to try and deliver something completely different to anything else out there. To break down my score:

Story: 7/10
Gameplay: 9/10
Graphics: 8/10

The story is admittedly nothing special. It definitely seems to me that the story was developed to fit the general gameplay which makes it seem less significant and somewhat of an afterthought whilst you're running around slaying Uruks. Despite this, it is still pretty engaging when you're watching the cut-scenes or doing a main-story mission and I felt it was good enough to suit the game quite well.

Gameplay is great. The combat reminded me of the early days of playing Dark Souls for the first time and how quickly you have to learn how to make combat work to get anywhere. It also reminds me of Metal Gear Revengence with the combo system and specials which feels incredibly rewarding as you pull of something neat in the heat of battle and it looks like a move from a film. As mentioned by many, the Nemesis system is a brilliant reinvention of traditional RPG bosses. Not only does each Captain have unique strengths and weaknesses that you can exploit, if one defeats you, they can grow stronger. If an ordinary Uruk kills you, they can be promoted to become a whole new Captain in the Uruk's ranks. The system isn't reliant on the player to kill these captains - the captains sometimes challenge each other to succeed one another. The player can take advantage of this and interrupt these events and take out both in one opportunity.
What stopped me from giving the gameplay a 10/10 is the stealth system which I found somewhat frustrating. Especially in missions where if the enemies set off the alarm - you have to start over.

Graphics are very good. Though I thought the hair wasn't rendered as well as it could have been - everything else looks beautiful - particularly the landscape.

Overall - a solid game. Well worth the price and the best [new] game out for the new consoles so far (Last of Us Remastered and Metro Redux excluded)."
BobBently,"Oct 8, 2014",10,"Under-hyped hit game of the year.  Just what we wanted.  What we deserve,  after that failed Destiny game that was shoved down our throats.
It plays like Assassins Creed,  So your ready to jump in & are already comfortable w/ the controls.
Top notch animation & graphics.   Killer combos (blood & death level 10!)  Sweeeet!!
Full of surprises,  Just the right difficulty too.    No multiplayer though.  But you don't need it w/ this game.
The single player campaign is so strong, you don't need anything else.
Enjoy this game.  It is spectacular."
Iberian_Buffalo,"Oct 8, 2014",7,"good things:
- open world
- interesting system of orc army(you can build your army, control, betray, help commanders)
- fight enjoyable ( little boring, you want to finish is as soon as possible to just complete objectives)
- encounters with commanders interesting(weaknesses, strong sides, you can use environment, you can use other orcs, you can scare commander or make him stronger)
- enemies remember you and speak about this
- really nice story
- great compendium that explain a lot about world, nice to read
- good character progression idea, weapon runes
- 30fps nice graphic
- great audio, nice use of mono controller speaker

cons:
- little boring weapon missions(at some point you don`t want to do them in next location, all the time the same but you can ignore them)
- control on mount(dogs) is sometime hard to control, creatures too much prefer to jump up/down than go around something, the same when you try to jump through window, game prefer to grab/climb walls
- stealth is too powerful(but well.. really fun :) )

final score: 7/10"
billgates0904,"Oct 8, 2014",10,"This is no doubt the best LOTR game ever. The game creators have put lots of love in it, and it reflects on how fun and amazing this game is. Do yourself a favor and go buy this game."
Gamer44,"Oct 7, 2014",10,"Shadow of Mordor is an incredible gaming expierence and one of the best games I have played in 2014.

This is truly a great open world expierence and one that will keep you entertained for hours upon hours. If you loved Assassins creed then this is a game for you."
KarolosPR,"Oct 7, 2014",10,"Taking into consideration some of the other major reviews, for example ""IGN"" and ""GameSpot"", I have to agree that the campaign, even though it is interesting to experience since it involves more of the lore of ""Middle Earth"", it is not the game's strongest factor/component. That does not necessarily mean that it disappoints, but that it leaves you wanting more. You get this feeling that the main story messes up what you already know from either the books or the movies (most common). My personal ""Story"" score would be a 7 or 8 out of 10. Of course, this game received good critic from major reviewers for a reason, and that reason is everything else excluding the ""Main Story"" of the game. This includes the fantastic gameplay with your epic sword, your ghostly bow, and finally your brutal stealthy dagger. Even more fun are the abilities that you have from being a ""Wraith"" where you are tremendously fast and blow you opponents heads off continuously. It is extremely fluid and responsive in every situation. There is nothing else to say about the gameplay since it is difficult to understand just from a review how impeccable it really is. This game was created, in my opinion, to introduce the ""Nemesis System"". Even though it is really easy to understand what it is doing while playing the game, I will just say this: Every kill you make, counts. Every kill your opponents make, especially counts! You could be fighting some random ""Uruk"" while exploring Mordor, and something happens and leads to your death. The random (could had avoided death) Uruk that killed you will now become a ""Captain"" and all the other ""Captains"" will increase there level. The thing is that if you are not careful while playing, and are constantly dying, the ""Captains"" can become a huge issue, getting into a point where they are totally harder than a ""War-chief"" (Commander of Captains). You might not understand what this means (not until you get the game), but basically keep in mind that you receive rewards to upgrade Talion , but think of his deaths as a ""Double-Punishment Treat"". You can always be able to kill even the hardest opponent, but don't expect it to be as easy as you might think since at that point, they will be invulnerable to simply everything.
To conclude my simple review for ""Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor"", I say that it always falls down to you (reader of my review) whether or not to buy the game, maybe you're not into games like this, or maybe this game has made things difficult for in terms of how the game it-self is made up. I will have to admit though that when I bought the game I was not entirely sure I made the right choice for giving away $60, but after while, I realized that the game is unique in it's own, specific way and has come out to bring a different sense/feeling of gameplay compared to anything else out there in the market. It has come out to intrigue ""Gamers"", who are looking for something different in terms of game development."

Ocima,"Oct 7, 2014",8,"Great game, great world and great battles! Only the graphics are not very good for this genertion consoles.. and the toturial is not very nice for newbies (like me)"
SomeHooligan,"Oct 7, 2014",4,"This game offers no real challenge to the player at all beyond the first ten minutes of learning the game mechanics. The Arkham Asylum type fighting system is really the worst possible choice they could have picked as it turns the whole game into a rhythmic quick-time event. Only one enemy attacks you at any given time even if you are surrounded, the rest stand around and wait their turn like a bad kung fu movie. If you do find yourself somehow losing a fight (maybe you weren't paying attention or dropped your controller) you can simply just vault over all the enemies, and run up the face of a mountain to safety.

Graphics and animation were nicely done, but seeing how this is 2014 this is hardly a compliment anymore in the gaming industry."
m3t4lm4n222,"Oct 7, 2014",8,"This is not your typical video game based off of a movie franchise. Hint: It's actually good.

I've spent a good 20+ hours playing the game and I rushed to complete the main story and I have had a blast the entire time. The Nemesis system adds another level to the game and as other reviewers have stated it ""Makes death matter."" For example, I was fighting a mini-boss, one of his minions dealt the final blow, so when I went to fight them, there where two mini bosses. Awesome.

In addition, the abilities for both the ranger and wraith powers work extremely well. You're not really ever going to choose one side over the other, as it's well balanced.

I would say the game would be one of the best games released as of yet on next-gen consoles, if there wasn't one, large, glaring issue. The story. It was....less than thrilling and realistically, very short. I'm not going to say much about the story, as I don't want any of my reviews to contain story-based spoilers, but the ending was plain awful. The good news is the gameplay and game design itself is good enough to hold the game up. Honestly, if the game had a berry story, I would have absolutely no problem giving it a 10/10.

All of the above being said, I would very much suggest this game to others.

Pros:

Combat (FUUUUUN)
Nemesis system
Ability system
Wraith/Ranger combo
Multiple wide-open maps
Ability to control orcs

Cons:

The Story. (The ending, what the heck man)"
Luthalis,"Oct 7, 2014",9,"One online reviewer called this ""The Best Assassin's Creed Game Yet."" and, yes, the Assassin's Creed influences are apparent. However, this game is much more Batman: Arkham City than anything else.

Let me simply say, this game IS Batman Arkham City. The combat is a LotR skin on Batman. I do not mean this in jest. I mean it in a VERY LITERAL SENSE. Identical button configuration in every possible way.

The game takes place in a very open world over the course of two medium-sized maps filled with roaming orcs, slaving humans, and the occasional tamable mount. Combat is frequent, and you're rewarded with bonus XP for variations in your style.

In the beginning you may feel limited by your ability to travel on foot, and possibly discouraged from exploring if you're trying to avoid combat, but by the middle of the game's skill tree you have access to several things that speed things up and never stop making you feel incredibly powerful. The game splits it's customization into three parts. Abilities that you get for earning XP, Stat upgrades (HP, ammo, etc), and Runes that are equipped on your weapon and drop from Nemesis enemies.

Which brings me to the main reason this game gets such high marks from me. The game is Batman Arkham City.. and excellent game with very good combat. However, what takes it above and beyond is the Nemesis system. Over the course of the game, this concept is expanded on repeatedly, but in practice there is leadership for the Orc forces in Mordor and they are represented by named enemies in the world. They always introduce themselves when engaged, and have a colorful name or physical characteristic that sets them apart. They are significantly more difficult to kill than other fodder, and depending on their rank they may have body guards including other ranked Orc captains.

The first thing you learn in the game is that your character is ""Banished from Death"" by a curse placed on him and this plays heavily into the nemesis system. As you fight Orc Captains, the ones you fail to kill who get away, or the ones you kill you will remember. They'll remind you that you rode away on a mount and taunt your cowardice. The ones who you couldn't finish off may even bear scars of previous encounters. I even encountered one who simply wouldn't die and kept climbing his way up through the ranks--- and no, this was not a glitch. The game made special reference to this fact in dialogue.

Even better, these enemies are randomly generated from a pool of candidates, and **** monster kills you, they are given a title and promoted to captain, free to work their way up to the highest rank: Warchief.

Eventually, you're given the ability to enslave orcs minds and use Sauron's army as your own if you take the time to dominate the leadership, but overall the system is always changing and it is definitely the stand-out feature that made this one of my favorite games in the past few years.

The story is forgettable and poorly executed, and I've even heard it upsets LotR lore, but I'm far from an authority and I was not bothered by anything I saw, regardless of how silly.

I 100%'d the game at a little over 27 hours and I really felt the absence when I beat the game; enough to find busy work in the world as an excuse to mess around with it just a little bit more. If you like the Batman Arkham series, this is an easy sell. If you're remotely interested in open world stealth/action with a neat new twist, I'd highly recommend this game."
scotto123,"Oct 7, 2014",9,"This game is a breath of fresh air for the PS4. With the multitude of ridiculous ""HD remakes"" plaguing this system (i.e. GTA4, TLOU) along with the lack of new titles, this game has put a step in the right direction for current-gen gaming. While it is obviously taking inspiration from Assassin's Creed and the Arkham series of Batman, it is a FUN game. While some people think it's a rip off or boring, I would say that it takes inspiration from other games and makes it their own. The nemesis system is incredible while being super frustrating and rewarding. I remember going back to specific warchiefs and captains AFTER I've beaten the game to test myself.

Having said all this, the story is interesting and works well within the LoTR universe. The graphics are fantastic and I only imagine they look even better on PC (sorry, PS4 ****'s true). The combat speaks for itself with it being very fluid while sometimes button-mashy, but fun in its own right. There's a lot of ways to make your character OP, but if one were to completely dismiss the strategy of runes, stealth, attacking enemies' weaknesses, you're going to be in for a frustrating time. That's the one thing I do enjoy about this game. With Batman or Assassin's Creed, if you were powerful enough, you could just go all ""guns-blazing"" and make it out alive. With ""Shadow of Mordor"", you have to use some strategy and some wits, otherwise, you'll be dead before you know it. For that reason, this game gets a 9.

I'm looking forward to more games within this series. A great new series from Monolith."
rhap,"Oct 7, 2014",9,"Awesome game. The Nemesis system is exciting and I can't wait to see even more of it, with more options and events.

The game is far from being hard, but that doesn't take away the fun of exploring it all and ruining Orcs plans haha"
Cilvyenn,"Oct 7, 2014",9,"I have always been a fan of the books and movies and have played almost all Lord of the Rings games and this one is my favorite other than LOTRO (which is an MMO).  I am not a big fan of Assassin Creed games but I do really enjoy the combat.  I feel like the combat in SoM resembles that of Assassins Creed III.  It has a parry and dodge system and it really works fluidly against multiple and hordes of enemies.  It does have a story but I am only 6 hours into the game and I have found a lot of story through the descriptions of items and memories they contain.  I also have not explored every area yet but from what I am seeing, the landscape and weather change is very nice.

Gameplay - The combat has a parry & dodge system with timed button presses you can counter-attack and perform finishers.  As time goes on, you earn more types of finishing moves and special attacks.  It is amazing to be surrounded by a horde of orcs and watch all of the amazing moves you can make and gruesome finishers as you parry and flip over them.  Some of the enemies are stronger than others, especially when you get to the captains or tougher opponents and you must find other means of killing them.
There is a nemesis system in place that really makes this game unique.  Each captain you face on the battlefield can and will remember you and the fight you had if they end up fleeing successfully or they are able to kill you.  If you come across them at another time, they will be stronger with better gear and will say something about your previous fight, or what you managed to do to them.

Sound - The music is very fitting and at times dark and ominous.  It can really immerse you in the world if you let it.  The sounds of swords clashing and orcs grunting as you are in battle seem very authentic.

Graphics - It isn't visually stunning but it still looks impressive.  There are times when the sun sets over the hills and rays of sunlight can be seen through trees and the like.  Little moments like that are nice to look at but I wouldn't purchase this game for the graphics alone.

If you are a Lord of the Rings fan, this is a must buy.  If you haven't seen the movies or read the books, I would hold off until it goes on sale or possibly rent it.  I give this a 9 because of the combat and nemesis system that is in place, AND because I am a fan of the series."
Edozul91,"Oct 7, 2014",9,"I've been playing this game for days and I got really impressed. Let's face it, It's the first great game on The lord of the rings and I really appreciate this thing. Personally speaking I advise you to get this amazing game whether you like this wonderful world or not. So, get it and you won't regret!!!"
PowerPagan,"Oct 7, 2014",10,"Power Pagan's NO BS, SHORT REVIEWS.

Have you played any AC (Assassin's Creed's) game's recently? Did you love them for the first quarter and then wonder why you were running around in circle's being told to restart mission's over and over, when you were sure you nailed that last one. Did you wonder when the never ending blathering would end and you would get some fun again? I know I did and i'm not interested in AC Unity, for now.

Shadow of Mordor spares you all this nonsense and brings back the Action and Fun to Video Game's. Having played at least 4 different AC game's I can tell you this. Monolith has got it right with Shadow of Mordor. The Nemesis system is awesome. The game controls really well. None of that trying to go left when your character is running up a wall instead. The fights are gruesome and having played over 20 hours so far. The main story is well fleshed out, and not in your face all the time running the action and the fun.

Go Get Shadow of Mordor and go remember what video game's were originally intended to be FUN.

Want some awesome Music and some awesome Uruk's to kill? Shadow of Mordor is it

NO BS from Power Pagan."
pauldie97,"Oct 7, 2014",10,"awesome game completely underrated and its a shame that some lets plays of the game like outback gamer are getting barely any views... overall though the game is amazing and i bet some games are going to copy the nemesis system idea, really innovative monolith."
Aplox,"Oct 7, 2014",7,"I found the game very amusing and polished but i had anticipated and endless horde of quests like Skyrim but insted it took me less than 20 hours to complete main story line and at 24:37 i have completed 95% of the game, since they dident make any multiplayer i doubt i will ever play the game again unless there comes some major update, so in short terms

Great game, but WAY TOO SHORT i am sorry to say that i am dissapointed, cus i rly love the gameplay but there aint enough of it, and no Multiplayer"
BlackNastyyy,"Oct 7, 2014",4,"As much as I wanted to believe it wasn't going to be an Assassin's Creed clone, it turned out to just be Assassin's Creed 2 re-skinned with unimportant Lord of the Rings characters...

Another hyped up disappointment in the year of 2014."
ieatglitter,"Oct 7, 2014",9,"Let me start off by saying that I did not enjoy Arkham Asylum, and I hated Assassin's Creed.  I also didn't like Shadows of **** first.  In the beginning it can take quite a bit of finagling and I won't say that I didn't say some silent prayers to Cthulu and sell the soul of my first born to Satan trying to get a handle on the game.  I opted to play the tutorial again, which solved all of my problems.

I am, however, a LotR enthusiast, well that's a little too far. I should say that I very much enjoyed the books, movies and games.  I found Shadows of Mordor (heretofore to be called SoM) a great deal.  I found that the stealth options were fun, the ranged options were fun, and the swingin'-my-ranger-sword-in-yo-face options were fun too.  There truly is something for each style of player, whether it be in your face, from the shadows, or a safe distance away.  Sure, the game will force you out of your comfort zone, but any great game will, in my opinion.

The game is also open world, so expect that you will find it easy to meander and fart around, but it is also easy to just follow the story lines.  I enjoy that very much, because I like to roam and get far from the storyline, but I like to be able to get back to it when I want, and SoM allows you to do that.

It combines innovate moves and ideas into the combat system, and rewards players for not always taking the easy way out.  The leveling system isn't too fast paced, and although I haven't beaten the game, I feel like the abilities at the end will be well worth the work, time, and effort.

The game isn't without faults, I can see how some people would get bored by killing throngs of Orcs.  I am not one of those people, though.  I hunt them down like the **** they are.

I feel that the Nemesis system bears some mentioning as well, because I think this is something that I have yet to see in another game, which makes it truly original, and originality should be rewarded! (I mean, sure it may be out there in other games, but I have yet to see anything similar to the Nemesis system as of yet.)  By using the Nemesis system, WB and IE have introduced strategy into a sandbox hack-n-slash game.

There is something to be said about replay-ability.  You can play this game through time and time again, and while the scenarios themselves will be the same, the way you handle them, and what you do will shape the outcome.  Literally every single time you play, you could end up changing something and finding quite a different result.

PROS:
Open World
Fun Combat System
Multifaceted Combat Preference Options
Excellent Graphics
Great Voice Acting
Replay-ability

CONS:
Open World
Feels A Bit 'Grind' Oriented
Somewhat Repetitive
Storyline Needs More Substance

Overall I give this game a 9 of 10 because of it's innovate system, excellent game play, and it's replayability. I subtracted a point because all in all, the story needs more substance, and the gameplay feels a bit grind oriented and repetitive at times."
chasiu852,"Oct 7, 2014",9,"What started like a Assassins Creed rip off quickly veered off to something a lot better.

I've always been a fan of Assassins Creed but there was something about those games that become very mundane and repetitive. I've only played SoM for several hours but there already are some distinct differences and things that make this game a lot more unique and fun. Character customization and weapon customization skill trees that unlock as you progress. A lot more combos and unique methods of killing enemies. etc.

What I found most interesting was the fact that every time you die. The guy who kills you gets promoted to a rank of captain (Your objective is to kill all the captains). If all captain slots are taken then they battle til the death for that captain spot and the winner gets stronger. If a captain kills you then he also gets stronger. This makes the game unique and the difficulty changes as you go. Very fun game!"
northernlad,"Oct 7, 2014",9,really enjoyed the ork captains are great my only complaint would be its more of an action game than an rpg but if your in two minds its a really good game
AngryRoach,"Oct 6, 2014",6,"Overrated. Story was 7 hours long and it was far from amazing. Your typical cheesy love story based on the tolkien world. You can 100% the game in 20 hours. Combat is Left click, Right Click and F to win. The game looks good and the graphics are good thought, altough some ground textures look like trash."
countyourmacros,"Oct 6, 2014",1,"Do not be FOOLED BY WARNER BROS PR TEAM who is clearly paying ""users"" to go and review this game positively.

This is average at best. It's like the deformed love (hate) child of Assassin's Creed and Ryse. So incredibly boring. It takes FOREVER to kill an average Uruk or Orc, and more often than not you're stuck sneaking around. Nobody wants a LOTR games where you're stuck sneaking around."
spyderdeman,"Oct 6, 2014",0,"A copy of Assassin!

Hackneyed plot, primitive fighting system, horrible management, and a complete lack of RPGs...

P. S. Unable to play more than 20 minutes"
kaldon,"Oct 6, 2014",10,"The game is incredibly fun, combat is engaging and you can kick some serious ass, but at times it can be unforgiving if you get a certain combo of boss NPCs. Graphically it is one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen. It is the most Nextgen title thus far. I highly recommend it I have it on PC and PS4 with the majority of my time played on the PS4. I haven't run into any bugs thus far, it is really well done, Monolith did a very nice job."
Dinizap9,"Oct 6, 2014",10,"The game is excellent and very well optimized. I'm a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's work in general and I can say that this game did not disappoint me. Sure, he's practically an Assassin's Creed: Middle-earth, but it is an excellent game. I do not regret one bit of bought it. Perhaps the only downside is the length of the game, at least the main story, which is comprised of only 20 missions and you can finish it very quickly if you want. 10/10"
DarthPreamp,"Oct 6, 2014",4,"I haven't played a more broken game since Two Worlds. YIKES! Which is too bad, because there is an great game trapped inside a mess of development and testing."
ScarletAndGray,"Oct 6, 2014",10,"This game is a blast to play and I loved how the game gives you the ability to create your enemies. I was worried the nemesis system would be a flop, but it did not disappoint. Of course it couldn't help but be a little repetitive (probably due to the fact I played it way to much), but this game is definitely worth playing. It has a much better stealth aspect than assassins creed and I liked it's combat better than the batman games because, to be honest, its more fun decapitating Orcs than simply knocking out your enemies with punches and kicks.
The story was not spectacular, but I was having so much fun romping around Mordor riding caragors and manipulating the nemesis system that I didn't really care!
This game was mysterious, interesting, and it makes me excited for any potential sequels."
kexan,"Oct 6, 2014",9,"This is a great contender for game of the year, but some small issues keep it from going to 10.

This game plays like a lovechild between Batman arkham Asylum and Assassins Creed, in a good way. The combat, borrowed from Batman is great, responsive, violent and rewarding. Its not button mashing, but instead rewards creative play. Having put some 50ish hours into each Batman it feels familiar very quickly. The only downside is that the game is somehwat easy, bordering on really easy if you know your stuff when it comes to combat. There are even guides on the internet to help you INCREASE the difficulty by turning off visual cues and not putting skillpoints on more health etc. I recommend (pre patch, lets hope they amp up the difficulty) everyone with some Batman experience to do this, since it really makes the game more fun to play.

Stealth is great and basic, and the feeling that mordor is constantly a threathening place is always there with patrolling uruks and other creatures.

The captain system for Saurons army is GREAT, and really adds a feeling of depth to the game. Hunting these guys is a great thrill, but , once again thanks to the lacking difficulty, results in a harder then average fight,despite their special abilites. A higher difficulty would really turn these fights into mino boss battles. The fact that its all randiom adds to the feeling fo a changing landscape.

I cant hype this game enough, but my only conserns are that the story is told in the background (not as much as Destiny though) and the lack of a challenge right now, about 50% through the game."
Jimmy_Rinser,"Oct 6, 2014",7,"This game is dope! I know I have only given it a 7 but its still worth a play. The game is what it is, big combos, lots of upgrading, lots of pressing square and triangle when promoted with a couple special attacks mixed in. Its kind of a mix between, skyrim, assains creed, batman and informus with a LOTR skin over the top.
Not ground breaking, no real new ideas but def lots of fun and worth playing.
(dont think it will have much shelf life, once completed it will be sold straight away)"
Perxoda,"Oct 6, 2014",8,"Very clearly a follow-up from the Batman games in terms of game mechanics. But with it's own feel and style heavily entrenched in the Middle-Earth setting.

Gameplay: The first and foremost aspect for myself. It feels smooth and intuitive. It's build on the basics of the Batman games which you'll clearly recognize. It gives you a bit more leeway for errors though (thankfully in this split second moments) and with the upgrade system get's some nice extra's. The stealth gameplay reminds me of Assassin's Creed games with a lot of the same movements. The stealth missions aren't too long thankfully. Orcs seems to be fairly blind though, allthough this allows for a better gameplay experience overall with more freedom  of movement.

Graphics: Not much to note here if I'm honest. It looks great (depending on your rig). Pushes the bar just a little bit higher and still runs well while doing so. Make sure you get the HD package after installing.

Replayability: That's where the downside of this game kicks in. It felt short. I completed the entirity of this game (side missions, collectibles, weapon legends, etc.) in 21 hours. For a modern third person action game that's a respectable time. Still it felt way too short for me and the main storyline consists of 20 missions which only tell a threadbare story. The entire time I was playing I felt like I was playing in an enclosed enviroment. Just a teeny, tiny bit of what could be a huge world. Some of the final missions were just to wrap up the story line and felt like the designers didn't know where they could go anymore. And a quick-time event for the final scene just seems like a waste to me.

Conclusion: An overall very good game which is certainly worth buying if you're into fast paced action in a good looking world. You might at times feel claustrophobic within the confined walls of the two zones, but there's plenty to do in this secluded space of MIddle-Earth. If the above is not true for you than I'd suggest waiting till the price drops to 25 euro's/dollars or so before picking this up. As far as the storyline goes you're not missing anything by not buying this title."
Ezekialx,"Oct 5, 2014",10,"Highly addictive game.  Fun combat system with forgiving stealth system.  A bit like Assassin's Creed in Mordor. Difficult at times, but not frustratingly so.  I'm enjoying the story."
HybernianWolf,"Oct 5, 2014",9,"Comparisons to the Assassin's Creed and Arkham series aside, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor has more than enough merits to stand on its own. I found the size of the world and the exploration therein to be quite satisfying for a game such as this, and discovering the many collectibles was very rewarding. The combat is fluid and responsive, and quite challenging (at least for me). When you get a rhythm going and build up your multiplier, there's nothing more satisfying than slaughtering and beheading countless orcs on the battlefield. Hardcore players might find the combat tedious, to which I would suggest disabling the prompts during such encounters to make for a more challenging experience. I'll not delve into the game's story arc, but suffice to say I found it to be fairly interesting, if a bit monotonous at times, but there was more than enough there to keep me wanting to continue forward. The real meat of the game is the much-hyped nemesis system, and it succeeds on countless levels. I spent hours just exploring Mordor and fighting war chiefs, and showing up to ruin there many run-ins with one another. These guys aren't out to get just you, they'll readily duke it out with each other and rise through the ranks in their ever-changing hierarchy. The nemesis system the standout feature in this game. It really gives your enemies more depth, and in turn makes Mordor feel much more alive and volatile because of it. If you're a fan of RPGs and open world games, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor comes highly recommended. Monolith, make another one of these!"
Raybel22,"Oct 5, 2014",8,"Very good game. I love the combat system as the battle can get intense and it is lot of fun. I just which there was more things to explore in the world. A little bit more from Skyrim kind of thing, something else than just collection writing for the wall and the memory thing . Sometimes it gets too repetitive."
parkerbigs84,"Oct 5, 2014",9,"If you enjoy The Batman & Assassin's Creed franchises then you are in for a very surprising treat with ""Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor""!! Great controls with an awesomely bloody & violent combat system!! It has a captivating & original story that is leaving its mark in the Middle Earth lore taking place in-between the Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit story time-lines.. While all that is definitely great; the most important thing is that ""ME: Shadow of Mordor"" is simply a lot fun to play!"
psugrad1999,"Oct 5, 2014",8,"I've been playing this all weekend, and I must say, over all I really like it on the Xbox One.  The graphics are stunning, the lore is rich and deep, and the captain battles are tense.  That is what I really love about the game.  What I don't love?  The story is really not that great.  While it actually has a story as compared to Destiny, and it's deeper, it's still seriously lacking considering how much material Tolkien provided in the original sources.  I get it, I'm revenging my family's death, but I just haven't don't feel compelled to disrupt the chain of command.  I have little reference for the locations.  So far, all the artifacts have told me more about the people then the history of the region, the factions, and the major players.  This might seem trite to complain about, but, when you consider how much lore is available, I feel that they should have made an effort.  The other thing that has really bothered me is the actual game play.  I don't mind so much needing to hit a button and just the right moment, but there are times where you have to move the pointer in the circle, and hit a requested button.  It's very similar to Laura Croft's 2013 release, and I hated it in that game also.  Finally, the AI can be frustrating.  I might find a captain, and I might know how best to fight it.  I can methodically take out all his unit, so it's just the two of us.  Or I could be in a battle, and one would show up.  I think, I can handle this, no problem.  I start fighting, and then, next think I know 2 or more captains show up.  I've had this happen both in and out of strongholds.  At first, I'd get killed, but then I quickly learned that sometimes, it's best to run and fight another day.  Other then my annoyances, this is a solid game, that has already given me many hours of enjoyment.  I knocked off a point for not using all the lore available, and another point for the actual game play mechanics.  If you like the Middle Earth setting, like button mashing, like a mix of outright fighting and a good amount of stealth, then by all means get this game."
byouwin,"Oct 5, 2014",8,Shadow of Mordor was a great game although there is room for improvement in the graphical improvement. If you are a Lord of the Rings or a hobbit fan you will get much more out of this games story as the game takes place in between those two movies. The story was quite intriguing throughout. A sequel was setup at the end of the game. The music always matched what was going on in the game so good job there. The nemesis system was a welcome change of pace in the gaming industry and I hope to see it in other games. The best thing about this game is that it is open world and there is a level of scalability. Overall the game was great.

Combat mechanics are a bit better than the one from Assassin's Creed that's the part that I like the most , anyway the short version: overall this is a very well constructed game, fun and exciting it's a very good game worth to be rated around 9/10
P.S: This is my second time when I waste my time with such activities to rated a game here."
Brit_Miller,"Oct 5, 2014",8,"I think the 10/10 reviews are way off on this. To say the graphics are next gen is just not true - they're distinctly average - and the camera is a nightmare at times near walls.

But, the gameplay is very enjoyable and the nemesis system is very good. I'd definitely recommend to other people based on this, but it's not a 10/10 game."
jimski53,"Oct 5, 2014",9,"some people scoring this game low ,this is a decent game and anyone giving this gamer less than 7 is a mug id like to know what game they would give a 9/10 too"
Fartahontas,"Oct 5, 2014",4,"Try to press X,triangle,O,and square at the same time, three of the four shoulder buttons, and coordinate both sticks at the same time.  Got it?  Now, run while doing that with the camera facing a direction other than the one in which you are running.  Next, get killed and you pretty much have this game in a nutshell."
boddhisativa,"Oct 4, 2014",10,"As a life long Tolkien fan, I get **** into trying almost every game that comes it set in his..........legendarium. Pretty much always ends in disappointment. To date the only real fun I have found in Middle Earth gaming are the Third Age mods for the Total War series. When I initially started to see press for this game, I was not impressed. The whole Talion/Wraith thing seemed to be very un-Tolkien like, and the gameplay reminiscent of other offerings. Then, in what I think was a wise move, Monolith revealed the wraith as Celebrimbor. Now this was really intriguing. Then as more was revealed about the nemesis system, I decided to buy it.

After finishing the game in 26hrs, at 60% total completion, I can say I am very impressed. The last open world game I played was GTAV ( on XBOX, SoM was played on PC ). I far and away enjoyed my time in Mordor than I did in Los Santos. Now, if you are concerned about story length, heres my take. Some folks have completed it very quickly. 9.5 hours is the fastest I have seen. In those cases the players blew through the main story quests almost exclusively. I am not sure this is a bad thing. If one chooses, it gives them the opportunity to do a quick play through that is story driven. It seems that when this approach is taken, the Nemesis system does not get much of a chance to develop powerful captains and chiefs. Folks who finish fast often complain its an easy game. Most others, who take there time to explore, complete side missions, etc, find it more difficult. In fact I see more complaints that it is too difficult than otherwise. I found out to be a reasonable challenge. One sure way to die quickly is to think this game can be played in the same styles as they games they are often compared to. It is extremely fun, extremely visceral, and addictive.

Are the specs inflated? To a degree. My rig is a i7 4790, 250g SSD, 16gb ram, 770 2gb. The High texture pack has a recommendation of 3gb vram. I have no problem running high textures, with all high settings, with max frame rates of 80, with very rare dips to the min of 55. I don't even seen those dips. The benchmarks just tell me they apparently happen. When I watch the counter I never see it go below 70. Can I run the Ultra pack? Well yeah. It dips, stutters, and rarely is ever as smooth as it is on high textures. I have seen youtubes of guys with the same card saying ""See, it can run it."" They get they same kind of performance I do. The High settings are a more enjoyable experience imo. I can run most of the other Ultra settings however, but my min framerates dip to 43 or so. Thing is, I have found what many ( pro ) reviewers have. The Ultra textures do not look a heck of a lot different than the High. I can barely not a difference on my 21"" monitor.

How does it look? Fabulous. Especially the named Uruk. The look, and sound better than any other attempt has made to capture them in any medium, other than the original source of course. The Nemesis system scores big in achieving its goal. During my playthrough there where a couple of notable Uruks for me. Most notable the spear grunt who finished me off when I pressed an attack against a chief to far. That grunt eventually rose the ranks with my blood. Always showing up at the most in opportune times to do me in with his poison spears. In the end I never did kill him. I recruited him instead.

How egregious was the story when it comes to the professors lore? Well, the best thing I could tell you do is go to youtube and watch the interview the dev. did with the guys fro theonering. net. A lot of effort was made to keep things within the lore. Have some liberties been taken? Some would scream ""YES! It's blasphemy."" For myself I am glad I gave it the chance. I enjoyed they story that was put forth. I found far less to be critical about with this game than any other Middle Earth offerings before. Certainly truer than the movies.

So, my score? 9/10. A lot of fun, well executed. I am still playing after finishing, doing the challenges and taking care of lose ends in the campaign. I have some small gripes about things like occasionally getting stopped/stuck in the environment where one would not expect to, but those are rare, and hardly worth mentioning. So, why am I rating it 10? +1 to balance those who gave it a zero, but have not played it."
tombo,"Oct 4, 2014",9,"This is the best game I've played since Dark Souls. Yeah, it's derivative BUT also innovative and
most importantly, great, great fun. Terrific combat, stealth, and progression systems continually
delight and surprise. Superb voice acting really immerses you in a compelling story."
vousje,"Oct 4, 2014",0,My hand is broken after playing nightmare joyless button smasher. Story is very bad. Lifeless battle system. Worst of batman and assassins creed. Why bother.
ForeverFalling,"Oct 4, 2014",10,"There have been some great LOTR games and there have been some mediocre ones too. Shadow of Mordor, thankfully, falls into the former. This is a must play, even if you aren't a huge LOTR fan. If you are on the fence, watch some gameplay. Obviously Ignore the attention seeking trolls that are giving ridiculously low scores and saying the game is bad."
Markolius,"Oct 4, 2014",7,"This is a good game, but it's not as great as many critics and reviewers have been making it out to be. The overall map is small, the quests are repetitive, the story is as almost as absent as Destiny's, and the camera is faulty. The nemesis system is what stands out the most in defining what makes this game unique. In that, the AI is smart in the long term but stupid in the short term. There is little variety in the game. Almost every enemy is Orc, again and again and again. I guess they can excuse the masses of dumb AI Orcs because masses of Orcs are dumb- so that was by design right? Right... And as with the gameplay so the same with the environment, it's a small open world and it all looks the same. When I think of LOTR, I think of grand beautiful variations of environments, races, and adventures. I mean I've only seen one hobbit and one elf; no wizards, dwarves, or trolls. This is just one small shadow of mordor. Still... The game is good. The challenges themselves are challenging and fun. The action is exciting. The graphical detail of Talion and each Orc is all very well done. It is similar to Arkham and AC as so may have said, which is not a bad thing. I'd also say that it's similar to Infamous as well in the layout of the map, quest & ability progression, and use of cutscenes. Music and voice acting are very good. It's got a solid dozen hours of fun. I just feel like it could/should be so much more."
djmusic10,"Oct 3, 2014",6,"Just finished the game well... I loved it and Hated it. I loved it because its Lord of The Rings and it provides some awesome Cameo's , as well as context on the land of Mordor. The Story line is your simple Revenge story that is extremely short being . The combat is your simple Assassin Creed and Arkham City engine which is cool but makes every single battle feel the same with only 3 different times of orcs, 1 neutral monster and 2 mounted monster. The camera is very clunky and the controls feel delayed sometimes.
The Biggest Downfall ! was the Nemsis System. This was their selling point and it worked got me to buy the game and looks cool when you work with it at first. But it is the most pointless aspect of the game . they combine the Nemesis system with the story line two times throughout the game which is good or bad depending on who you ask. Leveling up your orcs or taking them over don't do anything for you in game because even when you start the game your already an OP beast but as you level up the game goes from Normal to Very Easy. Its the same repetitive Nemesis Missions and they keep talking about runes which doesn't really do anything because you already can kill those orcs with ease without them"
LFiori,"Oct 3, 2014",10,"A nice surprise. Story is ok, the gameplay is awesome and the game itself is very fun to play. I think it is the best game released so far and everyone should give it a try, but of course it is just my opinion."
Fenntastico,"Oct 3, 2014",10,"This game is absolutely the best game on the current gen. The combat is the best I've ever seen. The Nemesis system takes open world gameplay to a whole new level. You actually get attached to some of the orcs. The first grunt to kill me in this game is now the highest ranked war chief. I took him down once only for him to resurface with a nasty scar. Half way through the game and he's been levelling along side my character, creating a very personal rivalry. I've attempted to kill him many times only to have him kill me every time. And every time I see him, he reminds me of that fact. I've now given up and will attempt to make him my number one when I take on the dark lord."
kirtasheks,"Oct 3, 2014",9,"I expected nothing and got a really nice game.

Glad to have it now, it gets a little repetitive, but suddenly they offer you more options. Really solid game."
SeanGamerDays,"Oct 3, 2014",9,"It's almost look like Batman: Arkham series, except there is blood in the game. However, It's fantastic! Brilliant, & f---ing amazing! But the campaign story is soo, unexpected! Lithtech, is a fine engine, and awesome, since it's been used, on F.E.A.R. series...."
adrenilinmatt,"Oct 3, 2014",10,"What can I say, for a game I had doubts about, I've been surprised plenty. Destiny came out not long ago, and well, all I have to say whilst mentioning destiny and this game in the same paragraph is that I wish the sales for destiny and shadow of mordor could swap. This game deserves massive success so much more than destiny. It truly lives up to the hype, fantastic current gen title,best I've played yet, I own xbox one version, which is no different to the ps4; however I imagine both versions of the game are as fabulous as eachother. How could they not be. If this game doesn't atleast get GOTY nominated, I'll be amazed. All hail middle earth, all hail inspired thoughtful games such as this. They are few and far between these days."
TyrannicalDonut,"Oct 3, 2014",9,"This game is a reskin of the Batman fighting formula taking place in Middle-earth with a new storyline. That being said, the combat is just as fun as Batman, while the story is not quite as good. Still well worth the purchase and hours of fun."
proudheretic,"Oct 3, 2014",8,"Shadow of Mordor begins by ripping out your heart and discarding it nonchalantly. The game is dark, even for Lord of the Rings. The gameplay is more than reminiscent of Assassin's Creed and the Arkham games, it is a blatant re-skin of them. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it draws from the strengths of both.

The missions and story are a bit bland, the classic revenge plot, and the missions are repetitive. The thing is, the missions are fun and it's fun to perfect them and upgrade your abilities so that you can dominate the next ""seek and kill"" mission.

That brings us to the ""seek and kill"" missions. This game gives meaning to every single menial ""kill"" mission by giving every single enemy a chance to shine with the ""Nemesis"" system. Even the lowliest peon enemy can become a major boss in this game by getting lucky and killing you. He gains power by completing his own missions and fighting his own battles.

That's one of the things that sets this game apart, you can do nothing and the world will still evolve without you.

The story could have been better, the controls are ripped off (but they're good ripoffs), but the ""Nemesis"" system is revolutionary and really gives this LOTR game an organic feeling that most games lack."
angryelves,"Oct 3, 2014",2,"Talk about boring, all you do is kill orcs. Granted, the style of hunting orcs and taking them down is pretty cool. But after awhile of killing orc after orc, the game becomes very rote, and a game cannot survive long on one thing. The nemesis system is a good idea, but poorly implemented; the leveling up orc captains do not significantly contribute to Talion's story. Speaking of story... Shadow of Mordor lacks a bit in that department. Gladiator-like, the story seems unoriginal, and tired.

This is a Batman combat feel with Assassin's Creed type of stalking. Definitely a rental, not a purchase type of game. Only rabid LOTR video game fans will appreciate this one for long."
noobishka,"Oct 3, 2014",1,"This game is disgraceful, it truly is very poor. Combat is dull and the free roaming has almost no joy in it. I wish I regain the hours i wasted on this excuse ****."
Zerathal,"Oct 3, 2014",10,This game is sent by the Gods! One of those games that has life to it .You will be able to play this for hours and forget about the main story . I Recommend this game to everybody that likes to play games !.
hiddenpheonix,"Oct 3, 2014",0,"Right now, the game is broken. Bugs are huge and ridiculous.
1) Auto save  so if you screw up, they win by becoming more powerful and that's permanent. Enemies become invulnerable to your every attack unless certain circumstances line up just right in a highly unlikely way. And those invulnerable will have all the missions include them so the game gets stuck.
2) Complex Quick time event, which is horrible to begin with, pop up behind the interface so even if you manage to get the the circles lined up, half the time you have no clue what button to it because of course that changes too.
3) 48 hours past game launch and still no prepurchase bonuses patched in to the game.
4) walk near a wall, get stuck on that wall
5)two hit kill enemies are everywhere
6) nothing fixed or choice, everything is random like diablo loot
7) Tiny map, like a GTA opening world
Save your money."
yssy,"Oct 3, 2014",10,Finally a LOTR game which is worth the money and the hype. I've played it for over three hours and enjoyed every single second of it. It's definitely one a the best game releases this year.
greedoinaspeedo,"Oct 2, 2014",9,"This is a very well made game with a lot of polish, an addictive and rewarding combat system, a beautiful open world to explore, and a decent story. It all adds up to a superb gaming experience that is hard to pull yourself away from.

I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Lord of the Rings, open world games, Batman games, Assasin's Creed games, or just a fan of viscerally satisfying combat. I would also mention that if you aren't a fan of Assasin's Creed series, despite Shadow of Mordor having a lot of gameplay similarities, it manages to overcome a lot of that series shortcomings."
trollkiller,"Oct 2, 2014",10,"The first game that truly deserves the moniker ""next gen"", The nemesis system alone may revolutionize PVe play in ways no game has done in years. With shades of AC parkour and Arkham Batman combat, the combat is challenging but rewarding.  The side missions are rich in Tolkien lore and really add depth to the story. There are a few frustrating moments when the gameplay might glitch and not respond so ****. But overall its by far the best game so far this year"
xhaosis,"Oct 2, 2014",7,"Its a decent game I actually give it a 7.5.  I put in about 1-2 hours into.  Its a button masher and I recommend drinking mountain dew coffee etc. Not beer while playing.  I had a hard time remembering combos but I am sure after more time I will get it down.  I was hoping for more of a rpg element or a bit more of a immersion into the world its more of a action game where practically your just running around pushing buttons to make countless animations mutilating orcs etc.  none the less it is fun its a face paced game so as I said you really need to be paying attention etc.  the sound is good visuals are impressive to my 37 year old eyes.  Its fun as I said I was hoping for more of a rpg element but can settle for less, dragon age will fill the gap for me.  Finally this game has more value than the previous titles that came out hyped to all hell. hard to explain but everything in it works pretty good etc you get what you pay for no bullcrap here with this game its a action button masher that can keep you busy for a few hours.  I don't recommend it for children if parents are looking here for gifts for kids, it is very violent etc.  You have to use your parental guidance on that yet as I said its very violent and graphic.  Practically a graphic rated R cartoon.  Anyhow this is my review its worth the money folks."
Xanerith,"Oct 2, 2014",10,"I cannot put this game down, sometimes I don't even follow the game and go about killing enemies and just messing with them the combat is awesome and to me never gets old, the story is brutal and not about happy times that's for sure! The nemesis system is very interesting and I hope it gets expanded upon on future games!"
hawdskinna,"Oct 2, 2014",7,"If you are in to the style of games like Arkham, or Assassin's Creed, then this is the game for you.  Its a fancy, polished mixture of the two.  The nemesis system is neat, but very over-hyped. It was cool at first, but the novelty wears off fast, and it just becomes an annoying ""cut-scene"" you have to skip every time.  It adds nothing to the game play that simply automatically promoting units would have done.

I'm also not a fan of RPG's where the ""spec"" you choose has no real meaning.  You get all the skills in the game very fast, and it makes picking what you select feel pointless.  At best, you just pick what you want to use an hour earlier than the others... then you just get those too."
RumThief,"Oct 2, 2014",10,"This game delivers in every respect it sets out to accomplish.  Yes, it combines some great elements that we've seen in several other triple A games and the combat and movement systems will be familiar.  I think they have masterfully blended them, though, and given us a game that we can enjoy again and again.  Kudos to the guys that gave us so many awesome small details as well."
Zegu,"Oct 2, 2014",9,"I finally had some time to sit down and play this. The initial hours are pretty fun. The tutorial is very well done, it teaches you everything you need to know, but it comes off differently than ""Press Triangle to Counter"".
It took me a bit to realize you have to sneak around at the start, running in is going to attract a lot of enemies and is a sure fire way to die.
I really love watching the power struggles among the Orcs that I am not a part of, it's cool watching the game evolve without player input."
Aendel,"Oct 2, 2014",10,"I would recommend this game to anyone who loves open-world games, killing orcs, and manipulating a hierarchy in a bloody and occasionally funny way. This is the first game set in Tolkien lore to take my breath away. Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor has a combat style similar to batman arkahm asylum but what defines it is that it is done very well. The animations are excellent and it flows very smoothly and when you see a prompt to counter you will counter if you press it on time, you don't feel like the game is cheating you in some way. The world is beautiful, as I have experienced both of the expansive maps, and they both have a unique feel, but graphically pleasing in some way to the player, not to mention the rain/hail and how it affects your characters textures as well as those of the orcs is beautiful. Then the Nemesis system is what puts the icing on the cake for sure. With owning it since tuesday ( two days ) I've done about half the main story missions, but the whole first day I just couldn't help but play with the orcs in the nemesis system. I would set out to go do a quest but then I'd walk by a mission to ruin this orc's feast for instance and I'd just get distracted and enjoy it! That is the most important thing in an open-world game, and that is the side missions are captivating and fun and sometimes more important than even the main storyline. I haven't enjoyed an open world game so much since skyrim's release, and I haven't enjoyed an action game this much for a very long time. Not to mention the innovation of the nemesis system can grow ad become more complicated as time goes on. Imagine a Mafia game with such a system, or even a batman game with this system where you pit joker's men against that of penguins or something to capture them both. Just an example, but this system could revolutionize the genre as it makes the player feel that they affect the game in a fundamental way, which is what makes Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor such a pleasing and satisfying experience."
bestkeeper14,"Oct 2, 2014",9,"Shadow of Mordor is the surprise game of the year candidate that every one should try it out!  It has a little bit of everything; Stealth, Action, RPG, Shooter, and strategy game mixed in and done well.  Every time I have engaged in a fight I have come away wanting to run around my house wielding a sword in person.  The combat is the best parts of the Batman Arkham series, mixed in with Assassins Creed game play, all set in the lord of the Rings Universe.  It isn't any where near a perfect game, but it is one of the best experiences I have had all year and the most fun I have had with a video game I can ever recall."
memtndude1,"Oct 2, 2014",10,This game is amazing. The combat reminds you of Batman and the open world gameplay reminds you a bit of the Assassin's Creed series. It is very easy to get deeply involved in the side missions and hunting captains etc. and forgetting about the main story altogether. The graphics are pretty good. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes good action games or LOTR. You don't need to be a fan of both to enjoy this game.
Marshy,"Oct 2, 2014",7,"After playing this game on pc, I can easily say it is a great game but there is alot of bugs and stupid systems Like the controls it is just horrible, I find my self smashing the space bar to sprint  but half of the time it dose not work,

The story is just above par, It didn't really make me feel any connection to the Tolkien at all and i didn't want to know what was going to happen next, I just kept at it cause it is part of the lord of the rings universe.

The game-play is great. Combat is smooth and fluid  the whole open world is stunning and run great on my system for a PC port the game runs perfect could not ask for a better job, Now and then the textures get messed up but still nothing too bad to complain and make a big fuss about.

If your looking for a open world game with great combat and not too arsed about story middle-earth is the game for you, You will have hours of fun taking Orcs body parts off"
Jitomate,"Oct 2, 2014",10,"Gameplay mechanics and combat are finely polished and highly enjoyable. Monolith has managed to capture the LORT world perfectly and paired it with Batman AC like gameplay. This is a must play if you're a fan of either, but the game stands out on it's own regardless if the obvious influences those games had on it.  Overall, an amazing game."

ShortReviews,"Oct 1, 2014",5,"A creative Nemesis system along with a Batman-ish style combat system which will entertain you for a few hours.  However, soon the enjoyment dies down and becomes a repetitive button smasher.  Try before buy."
Andynokills,"Oct 1, 2014",9,"This game is sweet. This is the first legit next gen game. Its story is good, could probably be better but the gameplay is awesome and with the upgrade system, the combat is always interesting. It makes destiny feel painfully empty.  Mordor obviously took batman and ac and came up with a brilliantly nuanced version of them.  The game makes you feel powerful but not invincible and their 'nemesis' system keeps you scheming and murdering your way to the top. This game could be 3 hours long and it would trump all destiny's 30 hours of grinding."
semperfi1503,"Oct 1, 2014",9,"I've been waited for a good LOTR game ever since LOTR: BFME II and I've not been disappointed in 2014. This game's story is quite short and maybe dull at times to me but everything else is really fun to just try and play. I've play all three Batman: Arkham games and I gotta say, incorporating THAT combat system into this game is freaking awesome! Always wanna build up the chain and get some sweet uruk executions. The animation is fluid, the RPG-like system is really simple but it works really well since the main part of the game is combat. And the voice acting is really great. The Nemesis system makes the world organic and alive: who would have thought that you would really want so much to exact your revenge on a particular Uruk - with a name and rank? And the world progresses naturally, especially everytime you die. Everything looks well polished and beautiful, and what's even greater: the game is almost bug-free to my experience though there some nuisances with turning on and off certain graphics options would slow down the game mysteriously, which I hope would be patched soon. All in all, if the developer wonders whether they should make a sequel(s), I'd say go for it but with a better and longer story, perhaps in the Second Age, which is largely left untouched in the films and previous games. And come on, who wouldn't love an adventure with a Ranger of Gondor and Celebrimbor the Ring Forger himself?"
joshsk,"Oct 1, 2014",5,"The nemesis system is frustrating in the early game. You have to kill certain enemies before fighting the war chiefs.  Unfortunately,  they respawn after every damn kill and still show up to guard the war chief. To really have a fighting chance you must avoid the war chief quests and level up abilities. I hate working so hard to kill an impossible enemy *(one immune to normal attacks and has massive damage), just to see them show up again. I think there are maybe 15 different captains and no matter who you kill,  they never die and only drop in the ranks temporarily.

Another crappy system is that early in the game, you might die a lot to the same few captains, because they have abilities that make them a tough fight. Guess what? Every time they beat you, they get stronger!  Having trouble beating an enemy? Let's give him a buff to health and damage. One enemy in specific made it to level 17 before I even had played an hour. I finally beat that mother **** and he immediately came back.

The story aside from the war chiefs js decent enough. I like the interaction with gollum. One strange addition is the artifacts you find. Each one has a story unlock that plays a dialog when you find them. Sounds cool?  It is not. The dialog seems random and appears to be taken from random conversations about people and things that mean nothing to you. I stopped listening after the first few.

Another major issue is the constant stream of orcs and no real way in the early game to deal with such a large number of orcs.

The biggest problem is the nemesis system that everyone seems to be Having a circle jerk about. If you fail a fight with a war chief, they now have more body guards and you have to start over! This game has such potential... Yes, it does get better, you have to griND levels, and early on it should be able to tell you are getting your ass kicked and back off on the difficulty so you can better learn the combat.   Either that or hide the war chief missions till the other main missions are complete. The game feels hard because you don't have the tools to deal with what they throw at you early on and if you run away or die that tough enemy gets TOUGHER."

scott1up,"Oct 1, 2014",10,"I love the game so far a few hours in. The tone reminds me of an old favorite game of mine Prince of Persia Warrior Within, Imo one of Ps2 gen's most underrated games. The game engine is obviously Assassins Creed but it feels different enough but familiar to control. Yes the combat is like Arkham Batman games, but Batmans code won't let him take out a sword and behead an enemy like Tarion in this game! I agree with the other reviewer, I expected a 7/10 mediocre game but I am glad I picked this up and dusted off the ps4."
willyAS3,"Oct 1, 2014",10,"Oh my god, this game is amazing. It's worth spending money on this game. It´s the best purchase you can make for your ""Playstation 4"". Graphics, sound, gameplay ... everything is at a higher level. Recommended."

The action and fighting are so amazing the controls are extremely responsive. there are some really tiny glitches but you will hardly notice them because you will be so immersed in the game. I love the Rangers in lord of the rings they are my favorite characters. There are some scenes that I find pretty funny, and the acting and voice overs are done so well I sometimes forget im in a game and not watching the movie. This is such an amazing game well recommended to your game collection."
SupaCoop,"Oct 1, 2014",10,"Shadow of Mordor has good graphics, an interesting story line, great voice acting, and difficult combat without being too difficult like Dark Souls.  Me being a hardcore gamer didn't take too kindly to being killed by low level orcs or uruks in the beginning of the game.  I started my game over a few times as I got the hang of the combat.  Monolith has made a game that it feels ok to die.  Using their nemesis system I can always get revenge on my killers, and revenge is always sweet.  I enjoy taking on multiple captains at once just to test my skill.  The world is filled with things to do outside of the main story.  Intervening in power struggles deciding which orc or uruk you want to succeed is pretty enjoyable.  They are missions to earn currency to purchase more rune slots for your weapons among other things.  Freeing slaves from orcs will also create a sort of human resistance where if a human is in your proximity that you've freed they will help you in combat.  Monolith has created a very rewarding loot system.  The loot is always equal to the captain or war chief you kill.  Their is only one bug in the game dealing with cut scenes.  It froze for just a few seconds while I was trying to skip them as I kept starting over.  The combat is extremely fluid, and you can travel across the world seamlessly.   Overall this is a great game to invest your time and money into."
Pureray,"Oct 1, 2014",10,"This game is well worth the money, it doesn't matter if you're a LoTR fan or not, you'll enjoy this game regardless. It's a lot better playing it for yourself then it is to watch someone else unless your doing it to watch their stories within the nemesis system, which is awesome. The graphics are simply splendid to gaze upon from above your forge tower. The combat is just satisfyingly brutal, and you have that freedom to do whatever the hell you want in Mordor.

I highly recommend Shadow of Mordor, you'll be surprised on how much you'll enjoy it."
twc004,"Oct 1, 2014",10,"This is the best game that I have played on the PS4, to this point. The game offers so much more than your average game. To those saying that all you do is run around and kill orcs, are you kidding me? There are more side missions than you want to handle! I love the nemesis system! It makes me actually think about running into bad situations before doing them. Great game that has a SERIOUS shot at Game of the Year honors. Rock on!"
CaptainBuck,"Oct 1, 2014",10,"I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoy shadow of mordor. This game flew completely under my nose until a week ago, and I am thankful I found this gem. I have seen only one textual pop-in, two slight framerate drops (lots of on screen action though so I'd say only twice is a good thing), and some wall-cover mechanics inconsistencies in four hours of play. I haven't had this much fun killing enemies in a pretty good while. This game keeps my attention, and the nemesis system is phenomenal. I want to see other AAA titles utilize a similar system. The cut-scenes have been incredible thus far, and I expect the same throughout the game. I would recommend a buy, but if you are leery, rent first but I can almost promise it will not disappoint. I would pay for another title this good any day"
frofrozzty,"Oct 1, 2014",8,"This is the game LotR needed. Stunning visuals, beautifully designed environments, intriguing and very Tolkien-esque story line, and a well developed karma system delivers the game that redeemed LotR video games for me. Saying that, there are some issues I have with this game. And I'm not talking about all of the bugginess, that receives a pass for it is a new game, and bugs are to be expected with the assumption that upcoming patches will be released. But those aren't the issues I'm referring to. With an action/adventure/rpg title like this, it's hard to not let the gameplay get repetitive, and I was hoping that with the vast universe of Middle-Earth at their disposal, Warner Bros would have been able to put this fear to rest. Unfortunately, this isn't so, and felt myself getting agitated at doing the same thing over and over again so many times. Another problem I had was relativity. I'm a stickler for video games and movies and tv shows staying true to the books or comic books they are based off of. And in this game there are some contradictions to the books, although they are not as massive and frequent as the ones in the movies. All in all, Shadow of Mordor proved to be an entertaining and redeeming addition to LotR based video games, I just wish that the game had reached its potential and actually made me feel like I was dropped into the universe of Middle-Earth."
AcousticStyles,"Oct 1, 2014",10,"The reviews are correct when they compare it to the Batman and Assassin's Creed games.  To me, that's great because I enjoyed both.  I loved the stealth and parkour of AC and the combat of Batman.  Put that in the LoTR universe and you have a great recipe for a game.  SoM is a LOT of fun to play.  The nemisis system is very satisfying as well even though it doesn't fully open up to where you can actively control it(aside from just killing the orcs and watching someone take their place)until the second act.  Facing an orc that once killed you really ties to the whole revenge premises of the main story.

I haven't beat the game yet but the story is intriguing so far.  I've always enjoyed any character that Troy Baker plays and he does an amazing job as Talion.

SoM is more enjoyable as a hack n slash game.  That's where it shines along with the nemesis system.  One thing I took notice of was that SoM has a lot of recorded dialogue for the orcs.  So much so that within the first hour and a half of playing, I didn't even notice a repeated line with the ambient orc dialogue.  With as much as you overhear the orcs talking to each other and their slaves, you would expect to hear more repetition. The landscape is just gorgeous.  At first you'll be playing in a dark area of Mordor but later on, you play in a much greener area.  It makes for a nice change of scenery.  Both are spectacular though.

The combat if very fluid and responsive.  It's easy to dispatch a small group of orcs but becomes difficult when you have 20+ orcs and 5 War Chiefs swarming you.  Then it's time to run and hide.

Now the cons.  The camera took a bit of getting used to.  I would prefer the camera to be set further back from your character.  I haven't checked the options menu though so it's possible there are alternate camera setting but probably not.

I also am not a fan of how quickly orcs seem to re-spawn in the area you are in.  It would be better if orcs didn't re-spawn unless you left the region but it does make for more head slicing opportunities.

This is a high action game with a small focus on stealth.  I would highly recommend you buy this if you enjoyed the Batman or Assassin's Creed games, or are a fan of the LoTR books.  If you are none of those then I still recommend it but you may want to rent it once to make sure this is the style of game you enjoy playing.  Some people just don't like to play this genre of game and that's o.k.  The others should really enjoy this game.

I am giving this a 10 even with the cons I listed.  Why?  Because no game will have everything in.  I will always find something I would like changed.  That's just personal preference.  My score is based off of the core aspects of the game and how solid they are.  This is a very well made game."

mrowley,"Oct 1, 2014",10,"Best game for all platforms all year so far!  The Nemesis system is a true next-gen feature that doesn't include graphics features.  The game plays better than Assassins' Creed, has the combat of Batman, and better gameplay than both of them (due to the Nemesis system).  The story is very intriguing and the graphics are a visual splendor!  Congrats to Monolith!"
fserb,"Oct 1, 2014",2,"The game feels like a poor Assassin's Creed rip off.

The camera is so bad that it becomes a challenge in itself. If you fight near a wall it completely goes crazy and points to random directions. It reminds me of old N64 games.

The stealth mechanics are bad. It's an open world most of the time, so the enemies just have super small sight. You can kill 3 enemies stealthly when they are all side by side and nobody notices. It's made to look like you are stealth, but in fact I think they found out that in LoTR orcs are deaf and have very poor vision. Also, there is no ""go behind the wall mechanics"", so when you go close to a wall, the camera focus on the wall and the controller gets clumsy (since you can't walk by the wall).

Combat mechanics are a bit better, but still clumsy. Fighting has lots of button smashing and the player moves in random directions sometimes. To compensate for the easiness of button smashing, the game throws tons of monsters at you at the same time. This changes the mechanic into: button smashing, run far from everyone (which you do faster than them anyway), wait for them to come in line, button smashing and repeat. Also, the bow mechanic is worse than Tomb Raider. The only ok point of the combat system is that you don't have to actually switch weapons (press square you use the sword, press R2/L2 you use the bow).
The open world part seems to be ok so far and the nemesis/famous orcs part works well. The respawn system is very aggressive (more than Destiny, for example). It means it is virtually impossible to get rid of all orcs in an area before killing the big guys. You kill a bunch of them, walk 15 steps, look back and there are more of them again. The only way to clear an area is killing the bug guys. It is designed like this because the fighting is very easy 1vs1."
hawkstar,"Sep 30, 2014",10,"I got to Play Test this game during development, and it was Awesome!! I am going to totally buy this game!:D It is so fun be able to decapitate Orcs!! 0:D"
LightMor,"Sep 30, 2014",9,"Dark Assassin's Arkham City Creed, um mm Souls?. That was the original game pitch at Monolith when someone at Warner Bros said ""Well we can't make a game called that, So lets just add LOTR to the mix and call it good."" So began the development of M-E:SOM (Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor)...

Ok its bin awhile since a game actually met a significant amount of Hype for once,
Ill say the story's more imbedded with the Lore of LOTR rather than Talion's. With his family dead and aided by a mysterious Wraith. The game focuses more on the Wraith, Rings of power, and Sauron himself but turns to Talion a few occasion.

The Combat is to say a combination of Assassin's Creed, Batman Arkham, a small side of Dark Souls, and plenty of Wraith powers to spice things up. With Fighting, Stealth, and a death mechanic that wouldn't make much sense if it wasn't for the Nemesis system (Which I wont go into detail cause ill be here forever) Ill just say it keeps the game from growing boringsome, but anyway the game goes the Hitman rout giving the player plenty of choice to dispatch your opponents.

Tech wise, its fine. the only problem I've encountered is with the Combat mechanics, a large pack of enemies can become quite a muddled fight with Talion attacking the nearest thing. Luckily their are Wraith powers to help counter this."
shadowmancer66,"Sep 30, 2014",10,"This is by far the most fun I have had dismembering orcs in a long time. Shadows of mordor is what happens when you take the best of assassins creed, batman arkham, and lord of the rings and melt it all together."
Just1nsane,"Sep 30, 2014",9,"I see a bright future for this franchise. The mechanics are very fun and addicting, the story line is true to the roots and interesting, the characters are of course awesome and voice acting is spot on. The nemesis system is very smart and useful. Love the soundtrack in the game. I will say the combat has been seen already in the batman series and it can get repetitive at times and people might hate me but I honestly thing the sneaking around is way better than assassins creed series its very fun and rewarding. Thanks WB for a good game keep it up."
OutDorJustice80,"Sep 30, 2014",9,"The developers did a great job right from the beginning. The sound quality is amazing, graphically wise it is good, but not great as it is multi platform and is a bit noticeable. However this does not take away from the experience whatsoever. They hit the mark with the gameplay. The nemesis system is truly groundbreaking, and I'm sure other developers will take note of this. Even if you don't know all or even some of the lore of LOTR you won't be disappointed. This might not be a GOTY, but it is a contender."
AlexMaTePblu,"Sep 30, 2014",4,"So if you were wondering what will happen if you blend Assassin's Creed and Batman together,this is the game for you.

The story is basically non existent,typical revenge plot.

Nemesis system is interesting in some ways,but became boring after like an hour,80% of the encounters with the captains/warchiefs are basically the same,some can just be killed faster.

The **** my **** god,it took me like 15 minutes to realise that the game is basically a Batman game,but with different visuals.EVEN THE KEY BINDINGS ARE THE SAME.I mean,wow...that is some lazy **** type of gameplay obviously was great in batman and worked there,but THIS is a fantasy ""roleplaying""(yeah right) game in which there's so much enemies,and you choose to go with attacks from batman?Non targeting system would be fine in this,but this is just **** copy

Plus there is a parkour ,it's basically ""assassin's creed type"" of parkour,just a little bit faster.

Game promised more that it could handled,i mean even if something is not that bad ...it's just average,no more - no less

**** this game"
Poopypants123,"Sep 30, 2014",10,"This game is finally a game that the LOTR Universe deserves. Graphics, Animation,  Voice Acting, and Combat are all top notch.

VitorCortial,"Sep 30, 2014",6,"The story of the game start as well, therefore in the middle of the game starts to get confuse and cheesy. The gameplay for me is the strongest point, it takes assasin's creed for another level! It's easy, beautiful mechanicals and a lot of blody!
The game is worth at all, there is some good background story, cool but emotionless protagonists, and a mistery to be discovered... If you love LOTR and AC, go on and eat the game, but if you don't like, man! Keep a great distance of this game! (Sorry my grammar erros, i'm brazilian and i don't write well...)"
IohanBR,"Sep 30, 2014",10,"O jogo é muito bom!

Os gráficos são incríveis, o detalhamento dos personagens, quando chove então...

Os combates são ótimos, os controle respondem bem e as finalizações são muito legais. Tudo muito fluído.

O sistema Nemesis é muito legal. Ver que os inimigos também evoluem deixa a coisa bem interessante.

Estou muito feliz com o jogo, tem um pouco de Batman e Assassin's Creed (deste último já andava bem enjoado e parei no Revelations), tudo isso na Terra Média. É show de bola!!!"
FrankBooth,"Sep 30, 2014",10,"This kind of game is not generally my brand of vodka, however, after seeing the trailers and reviews I was more than a little curious.

I couldn't be more happy that I gave this game a chance, it is outstanding. Game play is fun, story is great and the Nemesis system is outstanding.

Did I mention that it is absolutely gorgeous? I could look at this game all day. The attention to detail with the characters and world/environment is second to none. Just a really sexy looking game - cheers to the Monolith team for raising the next-gen console bar.

Even if this type of game isn't your normal type of game, give it a shot, I would be surprised if you regret it.

To those that compare it to Assassin's Creed: this is the game that they always wanted Assassin's Creed to be. Don't hate this game, embrace it. My bet is that after the next Assassin's Creed is released, Ubisoft tries to create their own Nemesis system, then people will be saying ""Assassin's Creed is just a poorly done Shadows of Mordor.""

Cheers."

Khalerzhus,"Sep 30, 2014",9,"Overall this is a very well constructed game and relatively under hyped. While the combat sometimes seems repetitive, the unique enemies their progression is extremely unique and are keeping me entertained. If you like the Arkham games or LOTR then there is a significant chance you will like this, as personally this is the best LOTR game made yet. The only reason I give a 9/10 is that there are certain segments where the frame rate drops slightly, but that is all. I would highly recommend this to anyone with a PS4."

Pickle,"Sep 30, 2014",10,"What a fantastic game this is, aside from the obvious problems that you can begin to notice in the beginning of the game, there's always somethings that shines lurking around as soon as you start feeling bored or tired of the outgoing level of little to no monotony that the game offers.
The irony is that the game doesn't have that much to say in the first place, that being said, it's difficult to really begin to explain what is so beautiful and wonderful about the combat system, the ""nemesis"" system, as well as just the general idea of exploration and the feel and vibe that the open world leaves to you. That's where the beauty of Shadow of Mordor really lies ahead, within the combination of the tree main aspects of the game, the game ends up being truly something special and worthwhile, started playing since yesterday, haven't looked a day older since then, truly a wonderful experience."
mtlevan,"Sep 30, 2014",10,"This is a huge Game of the Year contender.

I haven't done that since I was in college, and all I can think about is going home later to keep playing. The nemesis system is really incredible. It's the first time I feel like someone has truly made a game feel ""next-gen"" and innovative. Congratulations Monolith - you guys made the LOTR game I've wanted since I was a little kid. I really hope people purchase and support this game."
Sturge,"Sep 30, 2014",9,"Having played this at EGX in London last weekend I was not disappointed after queuing for a good 40 minutes.

Zyglroxenon,"Sep 30, 2014",9,"Ultimately, I think this game is worthy of all the praise that it has received thus far. As a full disclosure, I haven't quite finished the game, but I've finished nearly all of the story missions, and I'm cleaning up some of the side stuff, and I decided to write this while taking a break. So, bar an abysmal ending, this review should hold up.

RPG Mechanics
----------------------------------------------------------------
The first thing you need to know about this game is that nearly the entire focus of the game is on combat. When it comes to the actual RPG mechanics of this RPG, it's pretty light, honestly. You go about and kill things and find collectibles and etcetera to acquire EXP/currency to upgrade your abilities/weapons and there's also a rune system which are used to augment your character into some more specific roles. From my understanding, what runes you actually acquire from the Orc Captains are pretty random, but the ones I've gotten tend to rely on random chance more than anything else, just straight percentage rolls. Which is ultimately fine, as your character has another means of upgrading, via a skill tree system which actually has a good amount of variety/customisation. It's a tiered system (which makes sense) and the abilities actually impact the way you play the game rather than just provide you with a bunch of passive stuff.

Combat
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The actual combat in the game is very satisfying, albeit a bit easy. It takes cues from the Batman: Arkham series and just has a kind of freeflow combo system. A lot of games try to emulate this system, and a lot of games fail at this system. This game, fortunately, does the system well. The combat is very fluid and responsive and is generally very accurate. Also, the animation quality of this title is top notch, so moves flow into each other very well and your character looks completely natural while pulling off his extravagant combos. There is also a rudimentary stealth system that is functional, but very basic. You should not play this game in a stealth only approach, and if you do (if it's even possible), you are not very likely to have a lot of fun.

Story
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The story is pretty serviceable. It hasn't been anything that has been cringeworthy, it feels pretty in place in a Tolkien universe. I've read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but I haven't read the other Middle-Earth stuff, but as far as I can tell, the game doesn't really reuse any plot devices from the books and everything feels natural. I've had a lot of fun with the own stories that end up getting created as you play the game via the Nemesis system where you form your own rivalries with orcs and orcs will fight amongst themselves and vie for power. If you get killed by an orc, that orc gets more powerful and becomes your nemesis and you get to go hunt him down for revenge. It creates context to the battles you're fighting and gives the enemies more personality. Also, the voice acting in this game is top notch.

Technical things
-----------------------------------------------------
This game ran at a smooth 60 fps and, as far as I'm aware, didn't dip anywhere. The graphical fidelity is quite good (Full HD res even!), the texture quality was very consistent, and I didn't notice much of anything like texture pop-in, etcetera. The draw distance is quite far as well. In my playthrough, I did not notice any bugs or glitches. Once in a while there was some odd collision detection with the environment as you go for a stealth kill but outside of that, nothing.

Conclusion
--------------------------------------
The game is fun, pure and simple. The Nemesis system is pretty innovative as it allows you to play games in the shadows where you pit orcs against each other. I wanted to talk more about that, but it's kind of hard to put into text, you might want to watch a video that'll give you more detail on that. I recommend TotalBiscuit's video on YouTube.

I gave this game a 9 because later on in the game, things do start to feel a bit repetitive. Unfortunately, I think that is just something that's inherent to the combat system and the game is very combat focused. Do not buy this game if you do not like the Arkham style combat system. Also, the game won't really present you with much of a challenge, which disappointed me a bit. One other gripe with this game is that there are a couple forced stealth sections, they are few in number but it's, y'know, a slap in the face to player choice and agency.

When all is said and done though, I quite enjoy this game. It feels in place with Tolkien works and the combat mechanics are responsive, fluid, and fun while adding a bit of innovation to the genre via the Nemesis system. Also, the production values are top notch, truly an AAA title.

Monolith is back to form."
GlennGJ,"Sep 30, 2014",10,"This game is amazing, such a new and refreshing experience!. And also its 60 FPS 1080p! Excellent graphics, gameplay, voice acting, story, music etc. I can't find anything negative about this game so I'll give it a 10/10. Get this game NOW!"
Nistrega,"Sep 30, 2014",10,"Finally we have a LoTR game worthy of many hours of our time! Shadow of Mordor brings free roaming adventure and game changing new features together to make one amazing game. One of those games where you get lost in its mechanics and find yourself putting the story on the back burner. For me that's a good sign **** with good longevity.

Nemesis system is great, combat is satisfying and gory to boot. Story is there but I find myself making my own story to enhance the main one. RPG elements are there. I especially like how the weapons upgrade with ruins you collect off of war chiefs or other notable enemies. Graphics are great. There is not much tediousness that comes with the open world genre. You can fast travel pretty readily conveniently. But this is one of those worlds where I prefer to get lost in and take that short cut threw the woods.

Even if you are not a fan of Lord of the Rings check this game out. It is an amazing game on its own.
If you are a die hard Tolkeinite the lore should not be that blasphemous to you either."
Ondopher,"Sep 30, 2014",10,"With some issues aside, which I hope will be patched soon, the game stands to its hype. Extremely fun combat, with awesome visuals and not to mention the much loved world setting of Middle-earth, which I'm sure even non-Tolkien fans will rejoice. This is a RPG that I cannot wait to delve further into."
