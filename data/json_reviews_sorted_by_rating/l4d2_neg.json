The special infected, with the exception of the Witch, feel bad to play around (mostly due to their abilities just being an extra long stun). The maps being the same every time means if you don't play this game to the point of having the layouts memorized, you're going to get lost while your friends leave you behind. I acknowledge this is a literal skill issue... but it's still not fun.\n\nI give this game and its predecessor all the credit in the world for basically kick-starting the wave shooter genre (which gave us Deep Rock Galactic), but I feel like the concept has since been improved upon to such a degree that I find this game borderline unplayable now."

I'm sure a lot of people will find this opinion appalling but I'm being 100% honest when I say I didn't have much fun with the game.\n\nI tried playing this friends, and 2 out of the 3 of us ended up feeling that there wasn't anything unique enough about the game to warrant continuing. My main problem is that despite being a flagship co-op game, there really isn't a lot that brings you together. Some zombies people need saving from, others need more firepower to take down, but the game is pretty bare bones and it never felt like we were working together all that much. I'm sure higher difficulties require you to get more coordinated, but there isn't really a good balance between it being incredibly difficult and dreadfully easy in my experience.\n\nOverall I'd rate my experience like a 4/10.

More importantly I am concerned of hackers easily breaching player's pc or IP address due to how old the game and coding are.

(mostly classic cod zombies fan) \r\n\r\n#2 It seems the more friends you play with on in a custom game. even tough you select a difficulty the game amps up the difficulty even more. seems like the zombies are more aggressive. iv'e tested this solo I can complete a solo mission on advanced mode by my self. but as soon as i play with friends its almost impossible. \r\n\r\n#3 I know you can fix this issue with certain mods. but I don't like how you cant ADS in vanilla game play. \r\n\r\n#4 Some campaigns can be a bit long seems like they go on forever. \r\n\r\n#5 The A.I is so terrible even with mods that are supposed to fix them. \r\n\r\nNot going to really get into it fully. this is all just my opinion. \r\n\r\nDespite my complaint in #2 the game is far more enjoyable with full party and friends. \r\nand more enjoyable with cool mods like tactical stuff. \r\nbut as someone who doesn't really like L4D or L4D2 id still give the game a rating of. \r\n3/10"

        "review": "Coop campaigns are fucking perfect. Seriously little to no complaint there. Versus, which had huge potential as a source cooperative team based pvp with a surprising amount of depth and coordination, is honestly shit at this point. There's no tutorial or explanation or advice given to players who queue up. If you don't know anyone who plays versus, or can't find someone with patience who is willing to help you learn, its most likely not worth your time. It's common practice to check hours of players in this game. An abundance of cheaters. If you wait long enough to get a lobby together, if its stacked its more or less hopeless unless you start trying to kick your teammates in hopes of a better replacement. If you're bad at the game, good chance someone will try to votekick you, and ironically its kinda hard to know what you're doing in versus without failing many many times. You might make it damn near to the end of a campaign only to have the lobby fall apart from one sore loser leaving and kicking off a cascade. Valve does not offer any sort of proper support for this mode, evident by a large amount of server abuse causing redirects to russian connections or just straight up having the game servers ddosed. If you can get past the thorns, and dont take it too seriously, and are willing to keep trying over and over until you get a tolerable lobby, versus is a gem. Valve could really have done so much to support this mode better and divert it from the caustic baby spittle it is now, but l4d2 aint unique in that regard. Play the campaign, do the survival achievements, have fun with the workshop. If u decide to do versus then good luck lol. game still fun tho ;p\n\n\"Left 4 Dead should have been left for dead\" Thanks Gabe glad ur tryna fix ur mistakes"

The melee hitbox is bad. it feels like they took the original hitbox from l4d1 and just moved it to fit the melee weapons, this will make punting the hunter or jockey feel like a quick time event with no onscreen prompt and will ruin versus mode and possibly end friendships (your mileage may vary). still a 5/5 game, just please valve after all these years FIX THE MELEE! or let the community do it."

        "review": "Left 4 Dead 2, where do I even begin? This game has been a constant source of anguish and frustration, pushing me to the brink of insanity with its unforgiving zombie hordes and brain-dead teammates. It's like trying to survive the apocalypse with a pack of malfunctioning toasters for companions.\n\nLet's talk about the people I've encountered in this game. Half the time, they're about as useful as a chocolate teapot, stumbling around like drunken squirrels and shooting at everything except the actual zombies. It's like they have a death wish or a secret desire to see us all become zombie chow.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the zombie difficulty. It's like the game takes sadistic pleasure in throwing wave after wave of undead monstrosities at you, each one more relentless and infuriating than the last. It's enough to make you want to scream into the void and never look back.\n\nBut despite all the rage-inducing moments, I have to admit, the characters are funny. Their banter and one-liners provide a brief respite from the unrelenting chaos, like a flickering candle in the midst of a raging storm. And the design of the levels and weapons is undeniably fun, offering a sense of satisfaction when you mow down a horde of zombies with a chainsaw or blast them to smithereens with a grenade launcher.\n\nBut let's be real here\u2014Left 4 Dead 2 is a testament to frustration and futility. It's like trying to swim upstream in a river of molasses, with every step forward met with two steps back. And while some may find enjoyment in the chaos, for me, it's nothing but a never-ending nightmare\u2014a reminder that sometimes, even the best-laid plans can go horribly, horribly wrong."

Every other game will have someone spam N*****, spam some form of hate speech, or that one guy who downtalks everyone when he can barely keep himself alive.\n\nHate speech is one thing, but also this games community also hates new players, ive played since the survival pack dropped the 2nd week of L4D1's release on console so ive gotten better over time, but new players are expected to rush maps, know all likely si spawns, know where to sync with other teammates, know how to play every si, and know which items to use and when. All of these things seem like things youd learn with experience right? well if you mess up once about 2/3 of the time youll be kicked, and once you do get better you HAVE to also follow this kick rule if you ever want a chance at winning.\n\nOk, ok... the community is bad we get it, but if i knew all these things and ignored the hate speech, what then?\n\nwell now you have to deal with cheaters, ddos'ing, scripters, and griefers.\n\nDDOS'ing in this game is more often in this game than any other, you WILL get DDOS'd and might even have some jimmy loser put you on a bot list to auto ddos you.\n\naimbotting and cheating is common. scripts like auto bhop is even more often (like 2/3 servers you play, just open console and look for \"file denied 000000.dat\" and someone is using a script)\n\nalso expect people to suicide, friendly fire, and team swap then grief.\n\nSo youll have to deal with all of the above, and the people you play against in vs are mostly losers like me with thousands of hours on the game. So even tho this is one of my favorite games, i cannot recommend anyone get it."

I do not recommend playing versus unless you truly know what you\u2019re doing (also don\u2019t be too good because then you\u2019re a hacker!)\n\nIf you still have an Xbox 360 or Xbox One to play this game on you\u2019re safe from the attacks as the game is running on a different server!

The game also has a mode where you can play as zombies and have friends play as survivors and that's some how even worse. the ai on the survivor team some how knows whenever you're there and sprays you into the next world over. i thought this game would be more enjoyable since all i ever hear is about how this game is good whenever i hear anything about it. but as soon as i tried it, it was extremely bland. its extremely easy to understand, but it gets sooooo boring so quick. and the community is so toxic for no reason. i regret buying this game but im thankful i only paid a dollar."

I expected a completely different game and that's on me.\nBut if you asked me would recommend this game I would not be able to give you a cohesive answer,\n\nOn the one hand, this game is a masterpiece if you just wanna kill zombies in a whacky world.\nOn the other one, the game seems to show its age.\nOn several occasions, a large horde of zombies simply got stuck in a doorway with them infinitely respawning leading to a soft lock.\nThe other problem I have is the pacing. They throw all these enemies at you from the get-go so there is no tension or anything. From level 3 onwards I did not even feel the slightest amount of joy when I saw a new enemy cause I knew they were just going to be there and then dead, no build no nothing.\n\nShort verdict:\n-Great game\n-Not for me\n-Something you should check out if it interests you\n-personally would not buy this for full price."

I mean, it would be nice for them to add Aim Down Sights (ADS) like every other modern FPS, but that's probably a limitation on the engine, so whatever.\n\nOne thing that I don't understand, is why it is so difficult to get into a game of Versus. 17 thousand players currently online, and yet there is only one game currently one, with zero lobbies. How does that make sense? Are they all bots? Is L4D2 just filled with bots, how is it possible that I can only get one game with 17k players on?\n\nBut the community for this game is so unbelievably toxic, probably one of the most toxic in gaming. This is made even worse when you can't mute individual people and the fact that the host does not hold any veto power on members. Meaning, you can have one toxic and rude player join the game, have his friends join and kick out the original host. That, and the fact the community is so unwelcoming towards new players. You're new and you don't know how to bunny hop? Kicked. You don't save someone as they die from their own mistake? Kicked. In my 30 hours of playing this game, I can't say that I hold any positive experiences from playing online with randoms, just pure negativity and toxicity.\n\nThis is made all the worse when there is no report system in game, meaning that there is no way for Valve to deal with those players. I find it ironic that Valve is all about creating a welcoming community and ensuring that hate speech and toxicity has no place on Steam, and yet L4D2 is one of the most toxic games I have ever played, even more so than League of Legends."

[b]Missing Material and Models:[/b] A significant drawback is the presence of numerous missing material and models, which have gone unaddressed for a long time, affecting overall immersion and enjoyment.\n\n2. [b]Black Screen Issue on Latest Windows:[/b] Running the game on modern Windows OS can be frustrating due to a persistent black screen problem, even after multiple reinstallations and configuration tweaks, which is disappointing in an era emphasizing compatibility.\n\n3. [b]4 Player Limit:[/b] The game's 4-player limit feels outdated in today's multiplayer gaming landscape, where larger groups are common. Expanding this limit would improve the game's appeal and longevity.\n\nBeing a paid game, developers have a greater responsibility to address these issues as players expect a polished experience. If it were free, some issues might be more forgivable. In summary, the game's [b]core gameplay is enjoyable[/b], but the developers must resolve issues like missing content, the black screen problem on modern Windows systems, and the limited player count to reach its full potential."

Before the obliteration you and a group of friends could have the endless joy of repeatedly dying and losing all of your sanity being demolished by Tanks on expert difficulty. Hours of your life drained away viciously as you inch closer and closer to the most blessed victory and all embracing safety of the safe rooms. Now if you are knocked down instead of instant dread and tension of your one remaining friend playing out of his mind to clutch out a victory from the from the jaws of defeat, you just get back up on your own as if you havent been hit by  a car flying through the air. These WEAKLINGS on the valve development team. too brittle on their pure diet of soy found it far to difficult. \"How can we have fun if victory isn't spoon fed into our mouths\" they driveled on these disheveled baby's. Such insolent children. Now you will auto-revive, so no matter how moronic you are you will never have to rise to the challenge, never overcome the mountain. Cant B-hop? cant manage adrenaline supply's? Well don't you cry now. Simply walk through deep water at normal speeds! Humans are built to conquer hardships. To challenge adversity. Not to shrink from it. Please revert these two changes, or make a new game mode. It is not fun. You Have Ruined Me."

As a man with a big penis (15 inches), i have sex with lots of women with big boobs and butt all the time. girls love my big penis because it was very big big and they love having sex with my penis. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. i think the developers should add girls into this game so it can be spooky men and sexy girls. they could make it into a sequel and i think this would do more numbers than the original game. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. since i have a big penis, i get too many girls wanting to have sex with me. sometimes, i just want to have sex with myself (hand sex) while playing spooky men. how can i have sex with myself if there are no girls in spooky men? i don't think this is right and the developers should do something about this because my penis (15 inches) can't take it anymore. And i have no clue how people get girls that are nude in this game, i seen people post pics of their girl characters nude in the community section but none of them have explained how they did it and the game itself does not explain it either so therefore i assume its done with mods of some kind cus you cant play the game with girls. i feel like you lied to me so I'm not going to play this game anymore and am giving you a thumbs down."

You can pick any character and they function the same.\n- Versus, it can be fun.\n- fun with people/friends/buddies.\n\nCons\n- Lack of 'substance', The game is quite basic with the weapons and things you can do. Basically variety is very minimal. They added more items since L4D1 but it's not much.\n- no individuality, all survivors control and work the same. They don't have anything unique to them that affects gameplay except for cosmetics. While it makes it balanced for everyone, I find that boring. could have skills that give your player something unique.\n- Gunplay feels like empty, there's no 'punch/kick' to the weapons. it doesn't feel like I just blasted a zombie with satisfaction it feels like the zombies just take the bullets, checks how much life it has left, dies if it's less than zero.\n- weapon variety is basic, it's just pistol, shotgun, rifle, and sniper rifle. very basic and boring.\n- 'forced' teamwork gameplay, you're forced to play as team as oppose to being suggested to play as a team. \nIf you don't play as a team you get punished by infected that incapacitate you if you end up alone. I don't enjoy how pathetic your characters are at be incapable of saving themselves. It should have had more options for you to survive by yourself when you're caught in those situations BUT at a greater cost than if you worked as a team. Now that is making teamworking an option and not forced upon you.\n- multiplayer lag/desync. I unload a whole magazine into a special infect and it doesn't die because lag/desync had them elsewhere according to the game.\n- bots suck, play with people.\n\nOverall L4D2 is a decent game that could be better. I wouldn't play it alone, but if people invited sure."

But now it for some unknown reason doesn\u00b4t even start when I press \"play\". This certainly isn\u00b4t bc of the PC since I have really good graphics card and procesor.  I already tried few youtube tutorials on how to fix it but none of them seems working. I also uninstalled the game and installed it back, which didn\u00b4t help either. I really want to play it bc my friends keep playing it often and I always feel bad that I can\u00b4t play with them.

My son recently started Left 4 Dead 2 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories\n"

Console ports have disadvantages, clearly.\n\n[b]NOTE:[/b] I am quite aware of the existence of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2865107042]Legs add-on[/url] in the Workshop. In fact I have used L4D2 legs way before it was there, as a SourcePawn plug-in server-side. From what I could remember it is a VScript fork of Ludastar's work in the [url=https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2536139]Allied Modders forum[/url]. This still does not excuse releasing an inferior product, compared to the original, and calling it a sequel to said original.\n\n[h1]THAT BEING SAID HOWEVER[/h1]\nHere is a list of a few [b][u]positive[/u][/b] aspects Left for Dead 2 has now, which it did not have before. This may not benefit me, but it probably benefits more recent lease-payers.\n[list]\n[*]Left for Dead 2's license used to be 14,99 euros, later it changed to 8,19 euros. Now it is 9,75 euros. Every major sale (so far) and since the last price adjustment, both Left for Dead game licenses are on sale for 90% off (0,97 euros).\n[*]The game is in a state, which I consider the most playable it has ever been. Earlier releases had had more problems overall. This is chiefly thanks to TLS and other non-Valve affiliated sources.\n[*]Workshop is so oversaturated with content there is something for almost everyone.\n[/list]\n\n[u]MISCELLANEOUS STUFF[/u]\n[list]\n[*]There is a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/L4D2boycott]group[/url] which used to stand against Left for Dead 2's early release (only one year after Left for Dead released). This group mainly protested in fear of Left for Dead 1's abandonment and shelf life, however. I am posting this information in order to inform those whom are unaware of Left for Dead 2's release date not being well received by all. And for a good reason.\n[*]Last time I checked there are still Official Linux servers provided by Valve.*\n[/list]\n\n[i]*This is subject to change at any time, as neither Valve nor anyone else are obligated to keep providing servers for players. Code-wise this game is built on the client-server relationship. There are tools available for free which enable you to create such environments. One is [url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD]SteamCMD[/url].[/i]\n\nWhat stands out the most is the fact it took almost [b][u]ELEVEN[/u][/b] years for Valve's \"sequel\" to be polished on PC.\n\nLeft for Dead 2 first released in November 2009.\n\nTLS rolled out in September 2020. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/75849]News article[/url]\n\nOf course, one would wonder whether such a thing would have happened if Valve did not depend on its convenience store (known as Steam), giving them the privilege of not fixing their product before launch.\n\nTake it as you must."

Plus 1 extra tablespoon butter for brushing on pan\n3 tablespoons sugar\nFilling:\n2 1/2 pounds cream cheese, cut into chunks and softened\n1 1/2 cups sugar\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n1/3 cup sour cream\n2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 large egg yolks\n6 large eggs\n\nFor the crust: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325\u00b0. Process the graham cracker pieces in a food processor to fine, even crumbs, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle the melted butter and sugar over the crumbs and pulse to incorporate. Sprinkle the mixture into a 9-inch springform pan. Press the crumbs firmly into an even layer using the bottom of a measuring cup. Bake the crust until fragrant and beginning to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let the crust cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.\n\nFor the filling: Meanwhile, increase the oven temperature to 500\u00b0. Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until smooth, 1-3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and beaters as necessary.\n\nBeat in half the sugar and salt until incorporated, 1-3 minutes. Beat in the remaining sugar until incorporated, 1-3 minutes. Beat in the sour cream, lemon juice and vanilla until incorporated, 1-3 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks and eggs, two at a time until combined, 1-3 minutes.\n\nBeing careful not to disturb the baked crust, brush the inside of the prepared springform pan with 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Set the pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Carefully pour the filling into the pan. Bake the cheesecake for 10 minutes.\n\nWithout opening the door, reduce the oven temperature to 200\u00b0 and continue to bake the cheesecake until the center of the cake registers 150\u00b0 (about 1 1/2 hours).\n\nTransfer the cake to a wire rack and run a knife around the edge of the cake. Let the cheesecake stand until just barely warm, 2 1/2 \u2013 3 hours. Chill until ready to eat. Serve as is or with Strawberry Topping.\n \n"

Why would I want to hear the people scream \"RELOOOOAAAAAADDDDINNNNGGGGGGGGG\" right in my ear e v e r y t w o s e c o n d s? There's no way to turn off the deadzone of your movement so when you lift off the keyboard, your body continues to drift. \nThe biggest problem is the strange disconnect between myself and the zombies I shoot. There's no feeling anywhere that tells me I shot them. They just kinda collapse and ragdoll; they never get sent backwards, even when shot with weapons with supposedly huge stopping power. All that to say it's just not very conducive to immersion.\nSeriously, if you love horde shooters, get Back 4 Blood. It's the very same thing as this game, but much better. Everyone who said this game is so much better than B4B is allowing nostalgia to severely bias them."

I hate veterans on this game, they won't understand why us newbies played bad. They always t*xic to \n     new players not all of them but 99% of them was t*xic, griefing, teamup with enemies.\n2.) A lot of cheaters in versus mode\n\n[The reason i play on expert difficulty was because it felt more real rather than below expert.]\n\n* Gameplay : 8/10\n* Bots : -999/10\n* Veterans : T*xic/10\n* Guns : 9/10\n* Worth it?

There is a number of problems with the game, well not the game but mainly the community. L4D2 is a great game, probably one of valves best, but like everything in the world it is ruined by people. The community is more toxic than Chernobyl when it just exploded, every server you are going to find is guaranteed either people spamming the n word because they are edgy, people telling you to off yourself when not provoked, straight up toxic people and cry baby 9 year olds who will team kill you when you say one bad thing to them or accidentally shoot them. New players can't even have fun in the game, because if they mess up once then you are vote kicked because you have no idea what you are doing. Also because it is an old game most servers now are 3rd party server not owned by valve, leaving people to get their IP taken(make sure to use a vpn or make sure your ip is hidden somehow), and nsfw content to get posted, ik it is a 17+ game but yk kids are 100% going to play.

        "review": "Left 4 Dead 2, a game that has left me feeling thoroughly disappointed and disenchanted. In my humble opinion, this popular title fails to deliver on multiple fronts, leaving a bitter taste in my gaming palate. Allow me to elaborate on my grievances.\nFirst and foremost, Left 4 Dead 2's greatest sin lies in its overt simplicity. The gameplay mechanics, while initially promising, quickly devolve into a monotonous cycle of repetitive actions. The lack of depth and complexity hampers any potential for engaging strategy or meaningful decision-making. It feels like a relentless onslaught of mindless hordes, devoid of any true challenge or intellectual stimulation.\nFurthermore, my discontent grows as I examine the character selection. One cannot help but be dismayed by the inclusion of Coach, a character who seems to dominate a disproportionate share of the roster. The lack of diversity and variety in character choices is a disheartening oversight, further exacerbating the game's already overwhelming sense of tedium.\nAs I traversed the game's bleak environments, the visuals failed to captivate or impress. The graphics, while serviceable, lack the polish and finesse that one would expect from a modern title. The unremarkable textures and uninspired level design contribute to an overall lackluster visual experience, further diminishing any potential enjoyment that could be derived from the game.\nMoreover, Left 4 Dead 2's narrative fails to engross or engage. The shallow plot, if it can even be called that, provides little motivation or incentive to continue playing. The absence of compelling character arcs or a gripping storyline leaves players adrift in a sea of indifference, detached from the game's world and its inhabitants.\nIn conclusion, Left 4 Dead 2 falls short of expectations on multiple fronts, rendering it an unremarkable and unenjoyable experience. Its simplistic gameplay, lack of character diversity, underwhelming visuals, and uninspired narrative collectively contribute to a lackluster affair. I find it difficult to recommend this game to anyone seeking a satisfying and engaging zombie survival experience. It is a lackluster addition to the genre, leaving much to be desired in terms of depth, innovation, and overall enjoyment."

        "review": " I've played FPS since the 1st Castle Wolfenstein 3D decades ago, I was for about a decade the world's best Unreal Tournament/Quake-3 player (This isn't my main Steam profile), played almost every popular 3D 1st/3rd person shooter game (excluding the terrible ones like Call of Duty, Medal of honor, etc. that realistically depict modern war to brainwash kids into thinking joining the armed forces is a GOOD idea), so I'm MORE then qualified to say this game is B-A-D... why is it bad? Because not a single one of the 100+ shooter games I've played has EVER given me motion sickness like L4D2 does EVERY time... I use to spend 12hrs/day playing Quake-3 excessive servers, grenade jumping 200 feet into the air pulling out my railgun, & sniping players as I fell to the ground... never ever got as sick as a 20-30 min game of this does (not even when I had the flu did I ever feel this nauseous!) Why?!? I think it's a combination of the screen shaking, AND flashing with every pull of the trigger for my preferred dual wield pistols, every time you get hit the screen blinks, shakes, or BOTH, you get status effects, & the screen either shakes, or blinks (or turns colors too), AND every step, or jump has the screen shaking strangely... there's a DARN good reason MOST game devs give the options to turn these things OFF! I ran around at night in Iraq, with flares flashing, lights blinking, bombs, & grenades going off all around me, shooting either an M16, or sniper rifle, and never once got sick to my stomach, the devs who put these kind of effects into shooters are like the guys who put tons of motion blur in racing games, they've never done the actual activity, so they have NO CLUE what the experience is actually like, & their ideas come from hollywood movies. EVERYTHING else about this game seems really neat, I mean I've twice now (years apart, hoping the game had changed with updates) tried playing this with friends, only to get so sick I not only had to stop playing, but the nausea was SO bad, that I still felt sick over 24hrs later... The game runs smooth, would most likely run on a potato, controls great once you use Steam to switch your buttons to something that makes sense, doesn't lag online (I was literally playing it with a guy who lives 1/2 way around the globe, we had NO lag), sounds great, the maps, enemies, & characters are done WELL, & look/animate GREAT... so if Steam had a rating system instead of thumbs up/down, I'd give this a 7/10, minus 3 for no option to turn off the 3 things that cause motion sickness, otherwise the game's GREAT, so try it if you like such games (it goes on sale A LOT, so wait for one), & if it doesn't make you ill, count your blessings, & enjoy it, sadly I cannot."

        "review": "As a diehard fan of the first Left 4 Dead game, I had high expectations for Left 4 Dead 2. Unfortunately, after playing this so-called \"sequel,\" I can confidently say that it's a massive f**king letdown.\n\nLet's start with the goddamn characters. While the original Left 4 Dead had a lovable and memorable cast, Left 4 Dead 2 feels like a cheap knockoff with uninspired and forgettable characters. They lack the depth, charm, and chemistry of the first game's survivors, making me wonder if the developers even cared about making them interesting.\n\nSpeaking of uninspired, let's talk about the goddamn campaigns. Left 4 Dead 2's campaigns feel like lazy rehashes of the first game's levels, with nothing new or exciting to offer. Sure, the settings may be different, but the gameplay and objectives are practically the same. It's as if the developers ran out of ideas and decided to copy-paste everything from the first game.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the goddamn melee weapons. What the fk were they thinking? The first game's emphasis on ranged combat and teamwork was what made it so thrilling and intense. Left 4 Dead 2's addition of melee weapons only serves to dumb down the gameplay and make it feel like a hack-and-slash mess. It's as if the developers forgot what made the first game so great and decided to cater to braindead players who just want to swing a fking baseball bat.\n\nLet's not forget the godawful A.I. in Left 4 Dead 2. The survivors and the infected feel like braindead idiots who can't do anything right. They get stuck on geometry, they don't follow your commands, and they constantly put themselves in danger without a second thought. It's like the developers wanted to make the game more frustrating and less enjoyable for everyone involved.\n\nLastly, the goddamn realism mode. While it may sound like a good idea on paper, the reality is that it's a f**king mess. The game was not designed with realism in mind, leading to absurd situations where the survivors can't even carry a first-aid kit without dropping their primary weapon. It's as if the developers wanted to punish players for wanting a more challenging experience.\n\nOverall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a fking disappointment that falls short of its predecessor in every way. From the uninspired characters and campaigns to the braindead A.I. and dumbed-down gameplay, this game feels like a lazy cash grab that doesn't deserve to carry the Left 4 Dead name. Stick with the first game and avoid this piece of st at all costs."

It's amazing how bore the game gets because it insist on basic weaponry, also... wtf? YOU CANT MOD ANY WEAPONS!!! you're stuck with either a shotgun or a rifle, you can't add silencers, grips, skins, sfx, NOTHING\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\n\nIt looks pretty well actually, the zombies look amazing running at you and how they \"fall\" when you shoot them is so satisfying, but the characters are pretty lame. They take themselves so seriously and never do something funny, i want to hear them say funny things like \"woah, that just happened\" and not cringey dialogue.\n\nThe good thing is that this game is workshop compatible, so you can have your skins, HOWEVER anyone can download your skin and sometimes they don't see your skin, so if you want Nick to have a black suit you're the only one seeing it? it's BAD\n\nAlso there is no option for 21:9 ratio??? wtf it's 2023 guys what's wrong with you????\n\n[b] Story [/b]\n\nNot a single weapon nor item has a description, how the heck i am supposed to know about the zombie infection? it's horrible how you're just \"dropped\" in without an explanation or seasons so there's new intros that tells you how the game changes.\n\nAlso, wow thank you guys, two \"inclusive\" people as main characters... you really want to PUSH that agenda don't you???? was it so HARD to keep Couch and Rachel as normal people???? i'm really tired that these companies try to be \"social justice warriors\"\n\n[b] Multiplayer [/b]\n\nThere is no battle royale, don't even try multiplayer because of this"

        "review": "Nostalgic game which is nice, a lot of stylistic direction choices really hold this game up.\n\n- Bad netcode and hit/collision detection. This game relies [b]heavily[/b] on linear interpolation (lerp), possibly to account for the fact that the servers are 30 tick. This guessing for game interactions and especially hit registration is complete ass. But the next ugliest part is that it's ingrained into even the common infected's animations, so having low lerp settings makes them janky, jittery, sporadic messes that are incoherent which is sad because having low lerp settings makes the actual core gameplay more reliable. There's a reason custom servers like to run 100 tick servers and do away with a lot of the lerp nonsense.\n\n- Typical toxic community playerbase, lots of racists, bigots, griefers, and cheaters. Reprobates through and through. Obviously, not everyone you meet will be like them, but there's an embarrassing amount of them.\n\n- Stupid and obnoxious modded servers everywhere, you can put the offending server ips onto a blacklist using the `status`, `addip`, `listip`, and `writeip` commands, and load the blacklist every time you open the game via `exec banned_ips`, or alternatively tell your firewall not to allow those ips to connect. This doesn't remove the ips from the server list or prevent the game from attempting to connect to them, it instead means the connection attempts will never be [i]successful[/i], which leaves you sitting on a loading screen until you timeout. (Terrible UX).\n\n- Bad in-client matchmaking, you can select \"Quick Match\" -> \"Official Dedicated Servers\" and the game will put you into random lobbies that your neighbour hosts rather than a Valve official server. Having to open the server browser defeats the entire purpose behind why they decided to make this matchmaking UX to begin with -- they didn't want to just put another server browser there like they did in TF2 and wanted a less intimidating interface for players.\n\nIf you sink any amount of actual time into this game it will be apparent that it is not here to be enjoyed."

        "review": "I picked this game up because a friend wanted me to play it, have a about ~500 hours in it as of now but haven't played it for more than a few over the past few months.\n\nI'm sure this game was better in its prime day back when valve used to actually care about giving their games SOME form of live service, but now it's just pretty dog shit.\n\nThe game is pretty meh when it comes to balance. Most of the special infecteds kinda suck and can only really single out players and hope they cram in as much damage as possible before getting instantly obliterated by their teammates or just shove spammed into a corner and then lined up for an easy headshot. So you have to eloquently coordinate a symphony of attacks to even do anything to somebody. On the flipside, survivors are OP as a team but completely dog shit on their own. One survivor on their own will easily get mauled by less than 10 AI zombies even if they have melees and will get completely a55raeped, and so the only thing saving survivors is other survivors.\n\nSo you can kinda see where the main issue with this game lies, in that it's heavily team-based as a casual game with very little opportunity for either side to individually perform well. Yeah, if you're in a 4 stack squad with your friends against some randoms in a pub, you'll have an absolute pummeling your opponents. But if you're up against another 4 stack of crazy tryhards or, god forbid you submit yourself to this torture, you play WITHOUT friends, then you're royally fvvkkced.\n\nAnd since this game has a community of sweaty tryhards who play it like an esport mixed in with noobs or casuals, you can pretty easily see how awful it can feel to randomly queue up against a 4 stack and get steamrolled with no ability to carry all because you wanted to hop on a few rounds of L4D2. Maybe when this game came out like 15+ years ago, it was more fun and dynamic when everybody kinda screwed around for fun and didn't take it too seriously, but now with all the sweaty no lifes who love pubstomping, you'll need to find your 4 man queue of other tryhards in order to really have fun. \\\\\n\nAnd if that's your thing, go for it. If it's not, then don't waste your time playing this.\n\nOn top of that, there are SO many cheaters in this game. Whether it's people with bhop scripts, aimbot, wallhacks, auto shove, etc. This game has ALL of it. It's kinda sad that people do this but hey it's a valve game what do you expect. It's like every other lobby i'm in there's some dude cranking out 180 headshots who's invincible to smoker tongues and hunter leaps no matter how perfectly I time it.\n\nAnd to add more frosting on the cake, this game has dog shit hitboxes and registry, probably due to the fact that it's old, meaning you have to predict where you will collide with a player almost a full second later rather than actually just timing it on your screen. And again, i get it, it's an old game with old servers but i don't care, it ruins the experience lol. I can't count the number of times i've literally collided with a player model on my screen as charger and STILL, STILL not have it register in the server despite the fact that my charger is stuck running in place on their player model for a full second on my screen. And i'll check the ping values on the player list and it'll show me with the lowest possible ping (15-30 MS) out of anybody else in the lobby, so i know it's not my internet.\n\noverall, dead cringe game that's poorly balanced, poorly designed, way outdated from a tech standpoint, and infested with too many cheaters who can't stand to lose fairly and need to win with a crutch."

Its difficulty is impossible and your sense of freedom is minimal.\n\nLeft 4 dead is the pinnacle of shit shooter design. This is not a hyperbolic statement, I genuinely do think that. I\u2019ve played several games with half the content of Left 4 Dead. I\u2019ve played shittier games with more content than that game. It is a game that exists solely to make players feel powerful. Your character can damage enemies from afar with their shoulder mounted weapon and you can take out multiple them all with a single shotgun blast. The problem is, you can\u2019t. Left 4 Dead gives you the tools to do this but instead of using them you shove your head under the only thing that might actually work. This could be a fucking lantern, a car hood, or anything that allows you to get within 12 yards of your enemies.\n\nLeft 4 dead is the game where you shoot a gun for hours until you get bored with the action. Its the same exact shit, different play style and I can guarantee you\u2019ll get bored quickly.\n\nYou can't even create your own server without a significant effort and a knowledge of it to make it actually work. Which is lame because the server makes it playable for people. What about griefers. No mods, no way to block them, and no way to rehost without having a total disaster.\n\nI have been playing this game since the first day of its release and frankly it\u2019s wasted on me. I no longer care."

Game was one of my favorites for sure. \n\nThen Left 4 dead 2 came, It felt like a total upgrade, specially when they added the L4D1 content. The new specials were challenging, the new weapons were cool, and the newly dismembering feature (which was brand-new at the time) was amazing and satisfying.\n\nSome of my hours are not clocked into this account because I used another account at the time.\n\nSo. After a while, of course I moved on. Not every game I'll go crazy 5000 hours like I did with Payday 2.\n\nThen recently I saw a video of my friend playing it and felt like trying again. Missed the simpler times.\n\nOh boy I was wrong.\nOf course, I had a handful of great games, even got an achievement for finishing dead center before the first tank spawned, met some cool peeps, alright, cool, cool.\n\nBut then I had people purposely friendly-fire others, shooting every car they see, locking people outside, doing all sorts of childish shenanigans and spamming a lot of crap in the chat that would definitely get the social media platforms of nowadays very angry with them. lol.\n\nI shrugged, and kept going. Found another team of lads, same thing, different MO.\n\nKept going, yep, same thing.\n\nThen at some point I got enough and asked some guys that were already going psycho on the mic:\n\n\"Why are you guys playing a coop videogame if you all you want is havoc chaos to other players, there are better platforms to do that.\"\n\nHe laughed and then told me I'm the one who was wrong, because \"This game Main objective is Versus, and this \"other gamemode\" was not meant to be taken seriously, specially because it was such an old game, lmao, lol, kek, etc.\"\n\nThat's when I quit and uninstalled.\n\nWhat I assumed that happened was that a bunch of late Gen Z's found the game, said \"lmao so old lmao lmao lol kek\" as they usually do and then just decided to fuck around, which is fine if the game is meant to be like that. But this ain't one.\n\nNow the concept of the community is so twisted that people will behave in this way thinking THIS is how the game was always supposed to be played.\n\nThis is why I'm highly against coop games getitng a pvp mode. It attracts THAT type of people. They don't like 100% coop games because it's \"too boring\" for them. And thank God it is.\n\nSo my review was: If you're from the era I was, please play with only friends or just go solo. The CURRENT community kinda fuc ked the pub games."

It has to do with the fact that its far too easy for people to bypass the security of a 'private lobby' and if you play with friends on the dedicated servers and happen to be streaming?  good luck, there is an issue with trolls jumping in the lobby and causing problems for their own entertainment/stream.  Also if you go to vote to kick if they change their steam name to match your friends then you are out of luck because it does not show the character next to the name of the person you want to kick.  Not that it matters because the common tactic is they join then immediately call a vote so that they cannot be voted out immediately.  It would be as simple as the creators making private lobbies have password protection, but until they actually fix this i cannot recommend this to anyone who is playing with not a complete group size."

Sniper rifles are easily the worst weapons alongside the shotguns. Ammo can be pretty hard to come by in some maps, but overall the game is alright. Character design (both survivors and infected) is great."
