But the writing is just the biggest let down, and the theme is in complete disconnect with the gameplay and direction. You can't make a game about ""violence am bad!"" and then make an on the rails experience that is purely murdering everyone you come across. There's a stealth mechanic in the game, but instead of exploring the theme of ""VIOLENCE AM BAD!"" as the player and maybe trying to avoid conflict as much as possible, most of the game requires you to brutally kill people and the stealth mechanics just enhance that. It's crap direction and the writing is awful."

Almost all developers are uber-liberal, however, the good ones still respect the player base who do not have the same worldview.  Sure the story can end the way the writers want, but good writing can give you different moral paths to get there.  BG3 is the pinnacle of this."

It's no wonder then that the narrative is particularly important to my experience when expecting the same plot twists and dramatic tones. There's something wrong about the way the story is told, to be more precise its experimental structure that failed miserably. I also didn't appreciate the melodramatic way of conveying a simple message ad nauseum just so that the ending feels redundant and sprinkled with hipocrisy. Also weighing it down is a level design that has moments where it seems bloated, and puzzles that border on mediocrity at times. The only reason I can give it this grade is because the gameplay still manages to be brutally entertaining, and there have certainly been some improvements compared to the first instalment."

To be plainly blunt, it fell flat on its face. And the disappointment for me doesn't stem merely from Joel's death and the inability to play him. I don't also have an iota of problem with the LGBTQ narrative pushed by the game, though at times it is a bit annoying. The main problem with the game is its terrible pacing, lack of interesting and memorable characters, bad overall storyline and non-believable moments.

The characters are mostly forgettable after that point. The characters from the first game that make into this game are decent but all the newer characters lack depth or a reason to care about them. I couldn't care less about the second half of the story. It would have been better if the game just ended halfway through instead of the game making you play the majority of the second half. There's no payoff at the end that warrants the pain/hurt the characters (and you) feel in the first half. This felt like a rushed fever dream **** with greedy people just trying to make a game that rides off the coattails of the first game that was a masterpiece (and they know it) that unfortunately this game came no where near to being as good as. I'd avoid this game, especially if you have to pay for it, unless you have 20 to 26 hours of your life that you're just trying to throw away."

The graphics, gameplay mechanics and general feel is unbelievably good. For me personally, where this game falls short is the story, pushing real world political agenda's into games has always been one of my pet peeves, swapping out a hero because of their gender or sexual orientation, then pushing agenda's throughout the story, I got a bit sick of it after a while. By the end of the game, I felt like I just sat through a feminist seminar that I involuntarily attended. I don't have a problem with anyone's race, gender or sexual orientation, but I am a strong believer, in using that where it suits the story, such as Cyberpunk 2077, which done it perfectly, this game however, did not, it felt like bringing in a bunch of feminist views into a zombie world, something I cared little for. I will however note, the game itself is fantastic, and I am a huge Naughty Dog fan of everything they do, this game however, is just not for me.

TLDR:

Game itself: 10/10
Political agenda's hidden within: 1/10"

I loved the first game, it's probably my favorite game of all times, inversely the second game is the biggest disappointment a game ever caused me. I could write a lot of specific things about the story and about general concepts they have, but it doesn't worth my time. 
The story is terrible, it's loaded with far left liberal bs. There are lesbians (fine by me, but in this kind of world definitely not advantageous for a family), a trans (how exactly?! much more disadvantageous), woman with the physics of Dwayne The Rock Johnson (again how tf?!, not like you have a lot of steroids to spare in a zombie apocalypse), mindless **** old guy (because that's what those are, who does not support lesbians in an apocalypse right? :) ), stupid religious cult, that does not support trans people (like those religious people irl right? :) ).
The game disrespects the player several times, but I don't want to get into spoilers. There is an interesting theme all along about revenge, grief and forgiveness, but the game conveys these themes with a confusing, sometimes chaotic story that jumps all around space and time with strongly varying quality and detail.
If you loved the first game I strongly suggest you give this game a pass.

There is nothing anyone can say that makes sense of Joel's decision to tell his real name to a stranger -- after more than 20 years of experience in a cruel world, full of terrible people, having killed so many whose acquaintances would love to see him dead.

Just as there is no sense in Ellie's decision to have killed so many, abandon her family to obtain the revenge that absolutely everyone wanted and, in the end, save the person she was supposed to kill and who caused so much disgrace to everyone she loved.

All of these flaws are only justified if you, as a writer, wanted the story to be about an empowered woman replacing the cis straight white man, but anyone who has played both games knows that in no alternate universe would that woman beat Joel.

This game was a mistake. An error that showed how a bad script can ruin a game whose other aspects are exceptional."

As far as I'm concerned the real reason gaming journalists gave this game all those Game of the Year Awards was to troll the people that criticized the game.  Neil Drunkman had no excuse to kill off Joel within  the first hour of the game.  Remember Resistance 2?  In that game, Nathan Hale had a far more dignified demise.  He did something of value before he died, he died from a swift gunshot to the head, he was killed so that he doesn't become a Chimera monster, and he dies at the end of the game.  In Resistance 3, we play as Hale's killer but we are far more willing to do so, because he was far more sympathetic and he was remorseful for killing Nathan even though he knew it was the lesser of two evils.  Bottom line: Last of Us Part II is an abomination and Neil Drunkman deserves to be fired."

I think the scriptwriters of films and games they have some kind of psychological problems, hatred, depression, despair. In most scenarios, they constantly kill all the characters, even the main ones. Disgusting part, disgusting ending, the whole game was a waste. Don't write scripts, go get treatment from a psychologist and stop excruciate people. 
I hope I never see your games, much less buy them. Because of such fools there is nothing to watch anymore.

1st part very quality realistic dramatic game of post-apocalypse time and the start of it. With settings that allow you to play realistic Grounded - tactics stealth action shooter or very simply just shoot everyone and finish the game. But there are slideshows in the game as if the location is loading. The second part, on ps5, is an emotional trap where I think the developer disrespected the fans and did something that should not have been done, and besides, he replaced the plot with a very stupid plot without any connection even to disrespect and cruelty to the fans and that’s why the second part is simply very boring and annoying. The problem began much earlier, in this, the first part, in the DLC, in which they inserted a sick agenda and glued together other episodes as manipulation. If you take my character, the hero, the essence of the series and throw it in the trash, then why and how would I play this game or watch this movie? If you kill Spider-Man, why watch Spider-Man 2 without Spider-Man? This is extremely stupid and cruel. There are tragedies like Titanic with DiCaprio, but it is done correctly and naturally. And in the case of the second part of this game, this, to put it mildly, does not work. The second part is an aggressive, undisguised manipulation, and not a plausible realistic tragedy genre. A shame."

It's a colossal disappointment that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. This sequel is a perfect example of how not to continue a beloved franchise.First and foremost, the story is an absolute trainwreck. It's convoluted, poorly paced, and filled with unnecessary twists and turns that only serve to confuse and frustrate players. The narrative decisions made by the developers seem like they were chosen purely for shock value rather than for the sake of meaningful storytelling. The characters we grew to love in the first game are mishandled and their arcs are completely undermined, leaving players feeling detached and uninvested.Speaking of characters, the new additions to the cast are equally disappointing. Ellie, the strong and relatable protagonist from the original game, is reduced to a one-dimensional revenge-driven character with questionable decision-making skills. The game tries to force players into empathizing with her, but it's hard to sympathize when her actions become increasingly irrational and out of **** gameplay, while solid in the first game, feels clunky and uninspired here. The stealth mechanics are frustratingly inconsistent, often leading to cheap deaths and repetitive encounters. The level design lacks creativity and fails to offer any real sense of exploration. It's a far cry from the immersive and engaging gameplay experience we had in the first **** aspect that cannot be ignored is the game's heavy-handed political agenda. The Last of Us Part II seems more interested in pushing a specific message than in delivering an enjoyable gaming experience. The themes of revenge, violence, and LGBTQ+ representation are forced upon the players, overshadowing any potential for genuine emotional **** top of all these flaws, the technical issues are abundant. The game suffers from frequent frame rate drops, long loading times, and numerous glitches that break immersion and hinder gameplay. It's astonishing that a game of this magnitude could be released with such glaring technical **** conclusion, The Last of Us Part II is a soulless cash grab that tarnishes the legacy of its predecessor. It fails to capture the essence of what made the original game so special and instead delivers a mess of a story, uninspired gameplay, and technical problems. Fans of the first game will be left feeling betrayed, and newcomers will be left wondering what all the hype was about. Save your time and money—this sequel is a disgrace."

Good job. 1/10.They say Joel deserved to die because he killed so many people. Who cares about morality in post apocalyptic game? Guess what, Joel killed for his daughter, just like how abby killed for her father. People can forgive abby but not Joel. That's stupid. Also, if they had even TRIED to make abby empathisable IN THE LEAST or relatable or likable or showed that she had an absolutely legit reason to kill an old and popular character, it would have been understood. But no she just appears from some where and goes, ""I gotta kill him because he killed my father,"" and the player doesn't even get to relate with her pain or her suffering missing her father. You are SUPPOSED to feel bad for her, rather than actually relating with her missing her father and wanting revenge. Morality can f off in this world, unlike how everyone is saying, because its a post apocalypse and everyone will do whatever to survive. In the game as Ellie you also kill a ton of people. Does Ellie deserve to be curbstomped by some guys now?Also, I have seen a bunch of people who claim to have played only the first 4 or 5 hours proudly saying that they like it, and are also criticising players who leave a bad review but have finished the whole game. Automatically discredited. Play the whole game first, then leave a review. Joel isn't properly given the redemption he deserved in this game. Just because some didn't like Joel and left a good review doesn't mean theirs are more valuable than the ones that liked him and have left a negetive one. Leave your own experience. Don't criticise others because they didn't have a similar experience with the characters as you did. Everyone has different sentiments attached to the same game. Calling us angry men because we didn't like what happened with Joel and how his value was drowned over some needless plot channeling is a bad move. Get yourself fixed. Just because you disliked him doesnt mean he deserved to be forgotten and his value diminished after his death. The gamers who liked him and held more worth of him in their hearts deserved a better account of him, and our opinions are just as valuable as yours.I also would like to point out how you think every bad review is a result of review bombing but every good one is legit.

The gameplay is fine, and somewhat better than the first game (which is what is saving it from a grade lower than a 4), but the issues stem with the characterization and story, the strongest points of the previous game. When a game/series with an excellent story has a weak outing in a sequel, it will stand out. Abby's motivations are understandable, but the way it was tied to the first game just feels so hamfisted, and requires too many mental gymnastics to make it work.  It doesn't help that Abby is very impulsive of a character, reckless, and has no issues endangering her friends to get what she wants. Ellie, who's spent her whole life in this apocalypse, makes tons of illogical decisions that don't make sense with someone who has lived through it. She also has some of the same issues as Abby in this game. Joel's death wasn't what it should have been. He should have went out in a blaze of glory, or protecting Ellie, but instead he went out like a punk.  Now, while the characterizations were terrible, the actual protrayals are well performed, and I don't condone those who sent threatening messages to the actors. Sometimes, you need to learn to separate the art from the artist. I don't hate the actors who played these characters, I'm just not a fan of the character they portrayed.

The realm of narrative-driven video games is replete with tales of grandeur, and ""The Last of Us"" stood as a shining example of such magnificence. Thus, it's with a heavy heart that one must navigate the murky waters of its sequel, ""The Last of Us Part II.""

From the outset, the game's tone feels disjointed. Where the original painted a poignant picture of humanity's struggle and the lengths one might go to protect loved ones, Part II meanders, oscillating between half-realized themes and tonal inconsistencies. The gravity of Ellie's journey, so deeply personal in its intent, is often lost amidst the cacophony of secondary narratives that add little to the overarching tale.

Visually, while the world of ""The Last of Us Part II"" boasts intricate details, there's a palpable absence of soul. Environments, though technically marvelous, lack the atmospheric tension that once made every corner turned a potential threat. This sterility permeates even the character models, rendering emotional sequences somewhat hollow.

The game's narrative decisions remain its most contentious aspect. Characters, once beloved, are offered up on the altar of shock value, their arcs concluding in ways that feel unearned and, at times, gratuitous. This penchant for subversion, rather than adding layers, often detracts from the emotional heft of the storyline.

Gameplay, a potential saving grace, also falters. Combat scenarios, though more varied, often descend into repetition, lacking the strategic depth of the original. Stealth, a staple of the series, feels more forced than ever, with AI patterns that seem predictable rather than intuitive.

In sum, ""The Last of Us Part II"" stands as a shadow of its predecessor. Despite its technical prowess and moments of genuine emotional depth, the game feels like a disjointed tapestry of missed opportunities. One can't help but yearn for the nuanced storytelling and immersive world-building of the original."

174,0,0.5454,"story, last, also, character, gameplay, feel, instead, present, hype, find","The gameplay and environment are good, but overall tainted by the terrible narrative and overall theme of the game. Naughty Dog tries to warn and discourage players about the consequences of pursuing revenge, yet they force us to play as a character right after said character kills one of our beloved protagonist from the series! How exactly does this discourage us from seeking revenge when it only makes us sympathetic to their horrible actions.

Both Abby and Ellie do not mature or get character development and they essentially remain the same towards end of the game. Player's spend hours seeing their character get revenge by killing key characters and innocent NPC's only to spare the main target at the very last second? It felt like we wasted our time and we were left with dread and disappointment. It doesn't make sense for the main character to just walk away from their objective at the last second despite the fact said character gave up the pursuit sometime earlier in the story.

There are some characters in the game that do not supplement character development or show qualities that make us feel sympathetic towards them. Take for instance Jesse and Manny who are only there to provide some drama to the narrative without providing memorable personal traits.

The flashbacks were also poorly executed. Those flashbacks should have been the first playable parts of the game and then switch over to the main plot. It would have made the game's ending even more impressionable instead of making us feel like all our efforts were basically for nothing. I honestly think Naughty Dog should have created two campaign modes for the game, one focused completely from Ellie's perspective and another on Abby's story. Upon completion of Ellie's story we will have the option to complete Abby's campaign instead of having us switch between these characters.

Overall, I don't think this game is worth $59+ and I am disappointed with it. I think Naughty Dog should remake this game or at least learn their mistakes by the time they release Last of Us III."

178,0,0.4747,"story, last, also, character, gameplay, feel, instead, present, hype, find","The graphics are great, but not the gameplay. There are some issues with the gameplay mechanics and AI. And part of it has to do with the story telling and how the developers are trying to sway your opinion. To avoid spoilers, I’ll have to be cryptic here. You play as more than one character, and there is a significant difference between how easy they are to control (which seems to be another lame attempt to make you like that character more). Trying to play with Ellie makes it seem like she is physically ****. It’s like they turn the difficulty down a couple notches with the other character. They move faster, aim better, have better weapons that do more damage, get more supplies, are not noticed as easily, and craft more supplies with less materials. It’s a whole different game where you don’t care who you’re fighting or how much ammo you have, you’re going to win.
Playing the guitar was a clever way of using the PS4 controller, but after doing it again and again, it’s becomes a distraction. Can we get back to the **** yea, that’s not the strong-point on this one, is it?
Concerning the **** seemed the developers could not figure out whether they wanted a stealth or combat game. The AI follows predetermined patrol paths in every scene, until you do something. Then they obviously gravitate towards you no matter where you are hiding. Say you set a trap and sneak away to a quiet corner. Once the trap is triggered, all remaining enemies start moving towards you. Humans and infected both do this. It became most obvious when a human discovered me while I was hiding behind cover, and they were on top of the building I was in. Then he starting shooting and doing damage...through the roof. Hmm, ok.
If humans and infected are in the same scene, they will only engage in a brief confrontation before they act like the other side is invisible. That part made me curse out loud. You try to lure infected towards human opponents, they engage and then...just stop and wander around each other looking for you.

Story: Disappointing, over and over. The drama about ‘who kissed who?!’ makes it seem like you’re watching Pretty Little Liars. I wouldn’t actually know because I’ve never watched that show. Because I don’t care about who is kissing who.
Overall, this starts as a revenge story and it’s obvious they want to say that revenge is futile. But lord they make you pay for it, and that message got beat to a pulp with the ancient Greeks. You find yourself saying, ‘wait we’re going off to do what? What does that have to do with this story? Is this even the same story, and who heck is that guy?’ After a while, it’s not the same story at all

Concerning the events that happen, the developers try too hard for shock value and to mess with your head in obvious and tacky ways. You’re forced to do things that should have been a choice, and were probably bad ideas to begin with.
Also on that part, the decisions that are made by the characters seem unbelievably immature considering the world where the game takes place, and they’re own statements. The characters make it obvious how they little they care about other characters but then drop everything to go do the impossible for them.
Essentially, the first and second game have almost nothing to do with each other plot-wise. Watching it was painful and I wish I had not seen it.

Skip it. For me, the story of Last of Us ended with Joel and Ellie walking into Jackson after they left the hospital. He lies, she cries, and the guitar plays on. Best happy ending I’ve seen in a long time"

Neil druckman if you want us to get revenge let us get our revenge there is a mindset that chracters have in the first game but 2nd game is not loyal to that as we know Joel and Tommy are real badass survivours from the first game but they get ambushed like idiots I dont even want to talk about SJWs it's another point that I dont want to write here The game starts with Joel's death from the abbys group and want to get revenge for Joel we kill everyone and when wwe face abby game goes on abby sight before 4 years is that a joke you are making everything to make abby a  Main enemy then you are making her a Protaganist that I hate play with Than we beat ellie with abby :!!! that's realy disgusting after all that time when ellie come all way to get revenge she decides to forgive so I wanna ask what was all that for why did you lost all of that great potential of that game and betrayed the story of Ellie and Joel

The best chracter that I really liked in the game was Tommy I wish we take the revenge of Joel with his little brother Tommy the scene which he killed manny with sniper was really amazing he reminded a miller's power and badass moments the amazing moments in the game was absolutely Tommy scenes hunting abby and Manny + Joel and Ellie's moments.. İt was a game I like but the storyline realy upset me so My score is 2 and it's for the Engineers (Even you make protaganist The TOMMY and we take the revenge of Joel's that will be a game but you have really screwed up the story that's what I can say if we get killed by the people's son's or daugter's we will be the most wanted person in the whole the last of us universe with thousands kills really really so upset and sad):(.("

This is just a constant disapointment, easy and lazy storytelling, bad characters development, bad pacing, bad sequences, I mean, how can a flashback into a flashback can be consider a great ""storytelling"" ?

Great respect to the devs though, that made great graphics, that might be the best on PS4 that I've played. Gameplay got no real new interesting features, just melee combat feels better.
I feel a little diaspointed with the OST as I expected more from Gustavo Santaolalla, who made a better OST in the first one. Thanks to him, the first opus had a real identity, here it feels just okay. Nothing to be rememered.
At the end, everything in this game feels so enforced that it becomes funny."
240,3,0.5785,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","I loved Last of Us 1, but Last of Us 2 was very interesting to play and not in a positive way. I was seriously enjoying the story about Joel's death and Ellie trying to avenge his death, and Ellie's romance on the side. It could have been one of the best games ever.
Unfortunately, towards the end, I was forced to play as Abby. I really liked Joel as a character, and when Abby killed him, I, of course, developed a serious dislike for Abby. Furthermore, Abby is just a pissed-off, unlikable character in general. Thus, I really didn't want to play as Abby and found myself just letting zombies kill me because I wanted to return to playing as Ellie, and it was more enjoyable to watch her die than to try to help her survive.
I tried to play it out as Abby, hoping it would return to Ellie at any moment, but hours went by, and it still made me play as Abby until eventually I just said, ""Screw it. I'm not enjoying this game at all, and I stopped playing altogether. I've played almost every rpg there is, and there is only one other game I have stopped playing halfway through. Thus, Last of Us 2 is one of the only games I rate as a 0 out of 10 since it was so unenjoyable that I didn't even finish it. The lesson here is NEVER FORCE THE PLAYER TO PLAY AS AN UNLIKABLE ANTAGONSIST, PLEASE.
After, being so disappointed with Part 2, I don't recommend either of these games."

This game goes far beyond ""subverting expectations"", far beyond ""disrespecting the people who literally built your success.."", it goes far beyond anything I thought could be possible! And I say this even after Star Wars VIII !! Here are the same mechanisms, again and **** hijack some iconic product, some whole franchise, some whole fanbase, hijack them to bring them where you, some extraordinary minor but extraordinary ultra radical minority, want them to be put!

You know that if you did, by yourself, create a completely NEW product completely in line with your ultra radical political agenda, you know that this product would not pass the number of a couple of thousands sold copies !! (Even more without the false advertising you are experts at !)

So you hijack some big names which by themselves, you know it, will sell millions of copies! That's your kind of people's strategy, here and everywhere, again and again! Of course, false advertising is professionally applied!

And this game set a new record in that strategy! Congratz to you! But you'll learn that many, many, many people can acknowledge them being fooled once! But you'll learn that they are learning too !

As it is said : Vote and express Yourself with your wallet !!
I don't need nor want to swear, just believe me when I say that never ever will I buy any more product from Naught Dog!

Here are my ratings :

1 point for the technical side of that ""game"". That point goes to you all, the tech devs..

0 point for.. everything else.
The scenario is one of the worst I played, and you can repeat this appreciation to everything else (Artistic design, character design, scenario, originality, ""respect"" of the franchise, ""respect"" of the gamers, ""respect"" of anything of value in the franchise)

So that's a score of 1/10.. but I really should remove 1 point to respond to all the 10/10.. Adapting myself to the audience here around.. but no.. here too, I'll keep the respect I have for myself..

Some final words :
Thank you Naughty dog for making me a ""different"" gamer! You indeed made me ""progress"". I'm now open to spoilers! I'm now ultra careful before buying any AAA or any big franchise's products ! I'm now far more radical, following your example, with my opinions and search criterias !

I was a radical ""no spoil"" gamer.. since TLOU2 now I simply cannot and will never ever again preorder any games! I'll patiently wait for real people's reviews and for real people's feedbacks before thinking of acquiring any game ! Thank you soo much Naughty Dog!

Saying that I disliked this game would be an insult to every games I disliked..

Can't wait to see how will perform your next games.. I predict the same things as for Star Wars (you fool and totally disrespect people once, but you should not be able to repeat the process..)"

Without spoiling anything, here are things you should consider before trying this game.

Pros: The graphics are fantastic. That's all.

Now for the rest:
(1) This is not a horror game. If it was a movie, it would be tagged as ""drama"", then ""action"" maybe. You are not escaping some evil or hoping to find survive to reach some destination. In this game you are the hunter. If there is any horror, it's you. The whole game is about a quest for revenge. In doing so, you will butcher countless humans. There are still some infected (zombies) here and there, but they are more like random critters, not at all the main focus.

(2) This is the main problem. You play as various characters, but they are all detestable, including Ellie. I've never hated main characters that much before. If it was a movie it would be alright perhaps. But sticking such long hours commanding a character that you hate on a quest that you reject makes enjoying the game impossible. I still watched the story to the end, and believe me, it only gets worse. In the last hour of the game, I was like, are you for real !!!

(3) As others commented, the game has a lot of political messages here and there. As a mature individual I don't care, but the problem is with influenceable kids playing the game. And no matter what the rating is, kids will always play all kind of games. Then it becomes a problem what they are being told.

I believe this game killed the franchise. The only way they could release another game in this series is by moving completely away from this horrible cast."

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

The Last of Us Part 2 is a prime example **** that prioritizes pushing a supposed ""LGBT agenda"" over delivering a compelling and enjoyable experience. This sequel is marred by heavy-handed and forced attempts at inclusivity, overshadowing any potential for a well-crafted story and engaging gameplay.

Rather than focusing on the characters and their development, the game seems more interested in hammering its progressive messaging into the player's consciousness. The inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters feels contrived and unnecessary, as their sexual orientation becomes their defining trait rather than an aspect of their identity. The narrative sacrifices depth and coherence to virtue signal, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying storyline.

Unfortunately, this obsession with inclusivity negatively impacts the gameplay as well. The forced diversity feels more like tokenism, with the game's agenda taking precedence over meaningful gameplay mechanics. It's clear that the developers prioritized their message over creating a polished and enjoyable gaming experience.

In addition to the narrative shortcomings, the gameplay itself is riddled with flaws. The combat encounters lack innovation and fail to offer any real challenge, while the stealth mechanics feel clunky and unrefined. The pacing is uneven, with stretches of repetitive gameplay that make the experience monotonous and tedious.

Furthermore, technical issues plague the game, with frequent frame rate drops and glitches that disrupt immersion and undermine the overall experience. It's disheartening to see a game of this magnitude released with such significant technical shortcomings.

Ultimately, The Last of Us Part 2's preoccupation with pushing an ""LGBT agenda"" at the expense of a well-crafted narrative and enjoyable gameplay is a disservice to the potential of the franchise. Instead of embracing diversity in a meaningful way, the game comes across as pandering and lacks the substance that made its predecessor so memorable. It's a missed opportunity and a disappointing addition to the series ."

The bugs and glitches and problems that this PC port STILL HAS over a year after launch are ridiculous 

For me I'd have textures, mostly grass and water just turn into a black square of nothing, the characters' hair would constantly glitch out into low res polygons, trying to use DLSS for more FPS is basically unusable due to ugly ghosting that is caused by the game not having it properly implemented

The performance of this game sucks too, the fact that Valve really marked it as Steam Deck Verified is a joke, any game that runs out of the box with FSR on should NOT be verfied, it'll cook your steam deck and the shader complication you need to do every time you change the proton is ridiculous, I really only played the game for maybe 17 hours but it says I have 21 because of shader complying time after time after time 

It's really just a bad port, I thought they had fixed it, and its PLAYABLE but it is not $60 good

When it comes to the game itself, it's good, the story and writing and acting are all great, but I felt like ultimately it wasn't for me, the ending made me angry and has me questioning why anyone would play this game and want an addtion to the story, and I don't want to spoil anything so I won't, but just be weary

The gameplay loop I was alright with, it kind of felt like a cheaper version of Resident Evil, the stealth is great with the Clickers but after a while it starts to feel like the game is shoving it down your throat so I started just running head on into enemy situations until I eventually just didn't die because of how sick I was of it 

I have Part II on my PS5, so I'll be playing that next (after the Left Behind DLC on here) and I really hope I enjoy it more, but I just came out of this one feeling like a 7/10 at best, and that's all the bad PC port problems aside"

The writing is fantastic, characters are believable in its settings only enhanced by the voice actors, and the story itself is great.

Visuals are spectacular, and the attention to detail is top notch in the industry. 

The zombie designs and lore are some of the most unique out of all the zombie games I have played.

Really loved the runners, the stalkers and the clickers. 

The bloaters were ok.

But the game play is personally its biggest issue.

Puzzles are there just to pat out the run time.

The gun play is a bit lacking in my opinion, I would have to think hard of a game that doesn't do it better.

Combat at its best is found when the player is sneaking around and killing the enemies one by one. Whether its the humans or the zombies.

Attracting them and killing them off with nail bombs, motolovs or just straight up shanking them is actually fun.

I do wish it had more gore in it.

The most memorable moments are during escaping the city, from first encountering the Humvee all the way to rescuing Ellie from the fire.

The game slows down prior and after that for me. To the point of nearly losing me both times. 

The drama took center stage over the game play, and personally, that is the worst disservice that you can do to a game.

Overall, I would say is a C- for me.

A - Must Play.
B - Fun to play.
C - Decent experience. 
D - Forgettable experience.

Effectively the first of its kind in a generation of gaming rewarding cinematic narratives delivered in prestigious AAA realism, the harsh post-apocalypse puts on the pressure with a linear but immersive and distinctly survivalist experience. But perhaps as a consequence of the hype and awards it received over the last decade, it turns out I am not the audience for the exact way it tries to blend gameplay and story–it feels like oil and water to me.

I love video games as a storytelling canvas, for the unique language they are able to take advantage of. I love Psychonauts, Half-Life, and Undertale for trusting the player to engage with the depth of their worldbuilding when it is baked deeply into the game design itself. You don't really get enough in The Last of Us that utilizes the gameplay language meaningfully for narrative effectiveness like those games do. The game’s story IS good, that much is fact. Rarely, however, can TLoU deliver any piece of it in a way only a video game can.

Outcomes are all predetermined by TLoU’s set path, dampening its themes about the cycle of violence (a topic Undertale’s player freedom engages with more intimately since you can affect the narrative by choosing murder or mercy for yourself.) Extraneous worldbuilding is typically found only in written notes, a far cry from Psychonauts demonstrating who its side characters are with the intramental level designs that represent them, right down to even the collectibles therein. Ellie is typically invincible, taking away from the stakes of protecting her as you bring her across America. Compare that to Ashley from Resident Evil 4, who isn’t even close to being as much of a character, yet you feel more need to actively defend her since she has a health bar and a failstate for it dropping to 0.

All these simpler decisions TLoU makes lend to it having broad appeal, but in trying to please the many, it fails my expectations about what video games are truly capable of. I enjoyed subversion of numerous established functions in the late-game, where you're made to think you'll be going through the motions, but enlightened by character-informed twists instead. But it feels like too little too late. I dunno. Frontloading the game with status quo and saving subversion for the eleventh hour could be genius, actually, but it doesn’t come across that way after the gameplay basics got repetitive and eventually felt like a slog.

I hear the HBO show is a good adaptation! Looking forward to watching that with my mom. Having a version of this story that doesn’t bog itself down for me by falling short of expectations of its artistic medium ought to be nice."

Steam needs an option between do you recommend this game yes or no. Cause my feelings about TLOU Part 1 are very mixed. 

The game it's self is fantastic. 

The port even after a year just really sucks. It might be the worst modern port I've played. 
Strike 1: keyboard and mouse controls are wonky so you need a controller to really play it. 
Strike 2: The game refuses to save my display settings so I have to reset them EVERY singe time I play. It saves all the other settings 
Strike 3: Sometimes when I open the game it needs to rebuild shaders and it takes a very long time. No other game makes me rebuild shaders so often or more than once. 
Strike 4: issues that have existed since launch still exist. 

But when the game works it is so much fun. The setting, the characters, the game play are all top notch. Hopefully, TLOU Part 2 will receive the PC port it deserves. But given the issues I don't feel like I can recommend this port of TLOU Part 1 but I really want to."

425,3,0.4989,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","The game has great visuals, story is so-so, combat and shooting isn't bad, but there are three big issues with the game for me:

1. Key bindings are simply put atrocious -- you can remap them but you can't rid of the controller and console mentality. For example, manual reload and fire are both bound to the left mouse button, but melee hit is not. Melee has its own key for some retarded reason which is used both for taking it out and hitting. Worse yet, you can't take out melee weapon without swinging it which makes you yell and pop out of cover... in a survival game where sneaking is the key since you are always low on resources. Weapon selection is similarly stupid and done through long press of a key and scroll of the wheel instead of just using more keys, one for each weapon.

2. Joel decides at the worst possible times he had enough of holding a gun or a melee weapon and stoves it away automatically after 10-15 seconds of nothing happening just to get jumped by a Clicker a second later and get his neck ripped out. It is horrible design and mighty annoying. Hold the f*cking weapon in your hand man, you can't let your guard down in the f*cking zombie apocalypse!

3. Manual saves work except when they don't -- they often return you to checkpoints and sometimes it happens that a checkpoint is really in a bad spot so good luck getting out of the bind if it happens.

I don't really know what I was expecting when I know that the game was originally released on the console? I guess I was hoping it will have proper PC controls, but that was apparently too much to hope for."

Not so serious common problems:
The game always had performance issues and always consumed a lot of resources, it still lacks optimization. 
Errors in the graphics as bad colors or black dots; Also often you see corners or walls that do not load the textures well. On one occasion the display camera was moving on its own until the computer restarts. 
On another occasion the game stopped and stopped working when it had been around for two hours. 
Lots of auto save data was stored that I cannot delete. 
Issues that affect a lot in the experience:
I had to do the file integrity check 2 times. The first time because the game was stuck at the point that Ellie must be transported on a platform or ""palette"" (as she was called in the translation) before entering the Pittsburgh hotel; The second time, after a few weeks I finished the game, I had to do the verification because I couldn't activate two optional dialogues in the area before the Pittsburgh hotel. 
Several optional conversations that you had already activated were not logged until I activated them a second time after the second file integrity check. By the way, until I did the second review of the integrity of saved data, I began to get the confirmation messages to load games, in addition to the fact that before that second review the system did not record Ellie's jokes."

Decided after a year to buy the game as it looked in a better place, unfortunately this was not the case. While I am running older hardware (8700k and 1080ti) the game was silky smooth sometimes then a jittery mess the rest of the time.

The game crashed a number of times on my playthrough, which was frustrating.

I dont believe this game will ever be fully optimised, which is a great shame.

Also the small amount of combat encounters is really disappointing.I mean they give you certain weapons throughout the game but the game is so short and the lack of combat encounters is disappointing. Also the stealth is really basic.

The crafting is nothing unique but the workbench (which is where you upgrade your weapons) has some cool animations when you upgrade certain parts of the gun but it gets to the point to where the animations are you super simple tinkering animation or you wipe NOTHING off the gun and magically get an increased magazine capacity.(so I guess we have a magic rag)

It really is a shameful port that still needs a lot of work to make it right, though I doubt they will do anything at this point to fix it.

These are my thoughts but I did use ChatGPT to format and enhance them.

In reflecting on its esteemed launch, ""The Last of Us Part 1"" initially presents itself as a seminal entry into the survival-horror genre. However, revisiting the game in March 2024, I find myself grappling with a mixture of admiration and disappointment.

[h2]The Highlights: Story and Environment[/h2]

At its core, ""The Last of Us"" shines through its narrative and the beautifully desolate world it paints. The game masterfully crafts a post-apocalyptic environment teeming with detail and atmosphere, serving as the backdrop to a story that remains compelling despite its age. The concept of survival is not only a theme but a mechanic, though it's here my enthusiasm wanes.

[h2]Diving Deeper:[/h2]

[h3]Gameplay Dynamics:[/h3]

The crux of my critique lies in the gameplay. Spanning approximately 13 hours, the journey felt more like a chore than an adventure. As a player, you're thrust into a world ravaged by the infected and hostile humans, with the options to approach situations with stealth or aggression (""Rambo style""). The stealth mechanic, ostensibly a key gameplay element, proves tedious, often feeling like it sets you up for failure unless an inordinate amount of effort is invested in perfecting it. This repetitiveness quickly wears thin.

The game's upgrade system paradoxically muddles its intended gameplay dynamics. While weapon enhancements are readily accessible, encouraging a more confrontational, action-packed approach, the stark contrast arises with the [b]stealth and character-based upgrades[/b]. These crucial enhancements, pivotal for those preferring a stealthy playstyle, require a hefty resource investment, rendering them nearly out of reach until the game's later stages.

This imbalance not only hampers the feasibility of consistent stealth gameplay but also introduces a dissonance with the game's thematic essence. While cutscenes might glorify the player's prowess, suggesting a narrative of dominance, the gameplay mechanics, particularly the prohibitive cost of [b]stealth and character upgrades[/b], significantly lean towards vulnerability and survival.

Such a discrepancy between the narrative’s portrayal of the character and the actual gameplay experience, accentuated by an upgrade system that disproportionately favors aggression over stealth, [b]dilutes the game's overarching survival theme[/b], presenting a jarring inconsistency that detracts from the cohesion of the experience.

[h3]Narrative Engagement:[/h3]

The story, while good, falls short of greatness. Its linear progression feels outdated in 2024, a time when player choice and narrative branching have become standard in story-driven games. This lack of player agency diminishes the personal connection to the narrative, a stark contrast to games like ""The Witcher 3,"" where choices significantly impact the storyline. Incorporating choice in the PC remake could have refreshed the game for contemporary audiences without detracting from its core narrative.

[h3]Environmental Design:[/h3]

The game's environment remains a high point, meticulously crafted and immersive. It sets a compelling stage for the story, though further commentary risks nitpicking at what is generally an impressive aspect of the game.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]

In sum, ""The Last of Us Part 1"" stands as a testament to the potential of storytelling and environmental design in video games. However, its gameplay mechanics and lack of player agency, especially when viewed through the lens of 2024, highlight missed opportunities for innovation and refinement in its PC iteration. While it retains its place in the annals of video game history, one can't help but feel that this relic of the past could have been so much more with just a few modern enhancements.

472,2,0.4372,"shader, wait, take, hour, time, update, load, patch, minute, still",still has issues with crashing and booting
473,0,0.6805,"story, last, also, character, gameplay, feel, instead, present, hype, find","before delving into this review, let me preface this by clarifying that I played and finished this game when I was 13 yo. most of my playtime on the ps3 I spent playing factions ( multiplayer aspect of tlou ) and I didn't purchase the remastered version. also I haven't owned anything sony for more than a decade now. 

with that said, I don't think this is a good game. the gameplay is not good. it's intentionally clunky for, what I guess the developers decided, realism's sake. 
on it's own merits the gameplay could be considered a modern stealth masterpiece were it not for the lack of custom saves ( a stealth game with checkpoints is terrible ) and the fact that joel and ellie both have serious onset of parkinson's disease. no one shakes this much and sways their weapon like a madman while aiming unless they have severe physical issues or are drunk on the verge of passing out. 

it's clear why they added this nonsense to the gameplay, so you can grind for medicine and upgrade/reduce your weapon sway. 
that is peak modern gaming. they intentionally gimped the gameplay, so they can add an unnecessary upgrade system that is as bland and banal as ubisoft ""RPG-mechanics"". 

but on a positive note, the AI is a serious threat on grounded difficulty and can in unexpected ways, ruin your ghosting which is genuinely great but again the lack of a custom save system in a stealth game, ensures that it becomes an excercise in frustration. 

moving on to the plot that so many call a ""masterpiece"", I've got to say that it's sloppy and that's putting it mildly. 

it desperately wants to be realistic to a fault until it doesn't and it starts at the very beginning of the game with a marry sue character named tess. nobody finds joel the big, brawny dude scarry but tess? jesus, mary and joseph call the local fedra command because it's tess!

or the time they get caught by a patrol for no reason. they are hardened vets in regards to smuggling, yet they get caught by two random soldiers. why? because naughty dog couldn't come up with an organic solution to introduce the fact that ellie is infected and immune. 

it doesn't stop there. ellie was born after the central government collapsed and the fedra commanders enslaved everyone. so it makes sense that she has no grasp of pre-apocalyptic concepts. like why people emaciated themselves down to 12% body-fat, just to become a model and look good. that's good. it's reasonable.

however what isn't reasonable, is some of the forced situations in which the devs desperately try to make ellie more likeable with absolutely immersion-breaking moments. like her knowning in full detail how 5-star hotel staff received their guests. why is it in here? nd lacks the capacity to create organic situations. 

then there is their sloppy environmental story-telling. from soldiers in full functional tactical gear being strung up and left to rot in that gear ( in the apocalypse mind you ) to stacks of fully pristine clothes lying around. why? I guess some of their concept artists thought it was cool and that's why you don't allow artists to make stories, they let go of their pens and all of a sudden you have hodgepodge of concepts that don't gel. 

furthermore dead enemies with guns, won't net you ammunition but some random lubber with a rusty pipe? here you go lad with a full mag for your sniper rifle. 

if not any of this turned anyone with a functional prefrontal cortex off, then add a smidgen of idiotic american societal issues to the mix by adding something that is only polarising in the states and nowhere else. like their gun control stance. 
it's the apocalypse mate. nobody cares anymore. denying a 14yo a gun is a sure way to get both of you killed but like everything I listed above, nd doesn't have the capacity to tell a realistic story. 

but nothing really breaks the suspense of disbelief when joel out of the blue decided to see ellie to their destination. 
yes he had a daughter, nearly the same age as ellie but that was 20 year ago. he is now a grizzled, bitter old man that had to adapt in order to survive. him taking care of a 14yo because his partner begged him, is rich. 

but who cares I guess. the sony sycophants deemed tlou a masterpiece. my god the word has completely lost it's importance. 

2 / 5 graphical fidelity is exceptional, provided you have the necessary hardware. gameplay and story are grossly overstated by fans. if you still desire to experience this ""masterpiece"", then wait until a steep sale because once you finish it, it will be gathering digital dust in your library."

I have been wanting to play this game for many years. One of main reasons being the melee combat.
So I open up the game. Turns out I have to wait for shader build. Ok, let's wait. Took me about 90 minutes to finish building shader. Then apparently I have to restart the game. Ok. Start the game. Character models floating or moving in cutscenes right from the beginning. Cutscene ends. Now there is huge fps drops and stuttering.
So I thought I should verify my files. No problem. Rebuilt shader. But surprise. Over 2 hours spent and I can't even play the game properly.
My pc is decent. It can reach 60fps at 1080p without issues. But I figured let's lower the resolution. Still stuttering. Picked low preset along with fsr, still stuttering. So regardless of settings, I have stuttering. I figured let's cap my fps to 30 but there is still stuttering.
Now imagine running a game and you can play the game from high settings to low settings but still have stuttering in gameplay, still have problems in cutscene, is it even possible to give this a positive feedback?

Maybe future me can somehow keep playing this game even with the stutter. But as of now, I would never ever think of recommending this game to anyone."

Seriously. The game runs, even after all the updates, barely. If you don't have a computer 100% current then you're going to have issues in the cut scenes, game play and combat even with lowered graphical settings. It's just majorly clunky.

Turns out the problem is due to a flawed autosave: When I select ""Continue"", the game will almost always freeze, but if I load a save game, the game will always work.

The graphics quality is much better than on a Playstation 4 but the game play has major issues. Levels that used to be easy have become hard and my character doesn't always seem to function correctly during fight scenes due to some kind of change in the game play, but that might be something that takes getting used to. More importantly, I have less resources at the same save point on my PC than on PS4, which is very disappointing. I've had other problems with Sony games on the PC and they are all related to quality control (or lack thereof). The PS version of this game is not this difficult or buggy, so I don't think any quality control went into this version of the game. So I'm not going to recommend this game.

PS -- This program also has the same issue that I have with UNCHARTED (also by Play Station) where playing the game will crash Thunderbird."

Graphics 10/10

Cons:
No map, get lost easily. 
Crafting ???
Low ammo supply, guns weak even on easiest setting. 

I got this out of desperation, hasnt been much good games on the market lately and this is on sale RN. I have heard so much love and praise about this game its been on my bucket list for years. The first 3 hours has been very bad tho to say the least. 

Im constanlty running from point A to B. Go from a building to another, fight 4 ppl, repeat. The Melee feels underwhelming. You Punch the enemy in like 2 or 3 sets. Stealth feels pointless. I dont like the healing system. The crafting system feels very unnessesary. 

This really reminds me of lord of the rings. when Sam and Frodo walk for 3 weeks to mordor. This also really reminds me of Uncharted. Nathan drake style of movement and shooting. ( no parkour but js). 

Im gonna beat this stupid game just so i can say ive done it and stuff. Id like to see what people keep going on about this. But man. This is very stale. 

And almost puzzling. Literally. Many situations they put you in a room with an object that needs to be moved in order to climb. Like rolling a bin or placing a plank to walk on. Really weird. 

Dont reccomend. I really dont get why so many people love this so much. 

Graphics are some of the best ive ever seen.

The game's stuttering is out of control and completely ruins the entire experience and there isn't a chance to get immersed like you would like in a high quality story driven game such as TLOU. I Exceeded the recommended specs (RTX 3070ti, Ryzen 9 5700x) yet the game refuses to run for 5 minutes without stuttering (I also installed on my ssd which normally fixes stuttering issues in games). I genuinely don't think there is a pc that could run this without stuttering because the issues are with the title itself. Unfortunately if you want to experience this game with the best experience, buying a used ps5/ps4 is the best option. I also read the negative reviews and believe me i like to get the game anyways to check for myself even after the reviews but this time around, the negative reviews are 100% correct. If you would like to make sure for yourself then by all means but I just wanted to post this in case it helps anyone that's on the fence about getting this game because of the reviews. 

TL:DR: Pc port is not good lots of stuttering, gameplay + story is amazing, this review is purely negative because of the trash port not on the gameplay at all

Optimization is terrible, Frames go up to at max 50 if I'm lucky on very low settings. This game hogs CPU Utilization like a fat kid in a Golden Coral hogging the chocolate fountain. I shouldn't have to pay $60 for a game I can't even play without constant crashes/stuttering.

Note. My CPU and GPU aren't exactly new by today's standards, but HOLY SHIT. IT SHOULD AT LEAST RUN CONSISTENTLY. MY 1080ti SHOULD GET AT LEAST 60 FPS ON 1080p LOW SETTINGS.

I tried giving this steaming, spore spilling, pile of Bloater shit the benefit of the doubt by saying ""Hey, maybe it's just an issue with my setup. I can surely fix this in a jiffy!"".

But even on a fresh install of Windows, with fresh drivers, it still runs like absolute doo doo. And at a gargantuan size of 70GBs, it's not exactly quick to download/install. It's also very slow to make shaders. It takes at least 40 mins, just to do that, and that's just at the damn title screen.

If your game needs more than 4 CPU cores to function even remotely correctly, there's obviously something very wrong with it.

However, even after all these patches and months, the game still crashes A LOT.
I do not have the most beast rig in the world, but my PC is capable of running the game on Ultra settings 60FPS capped, without FPS drops or stutters, and still, crashes are guaranteed every time I play.

How did you screw this up Naughty Dog? The Last of Us is in many peoples opinions is one of the best games ever made, for this reason you would think as one of the best game developers out there, they would have put maximum effort into this huge PC remake. 

The worst part is, I've literally just finished playing Uncharted - A Thieves Legacy which is frankly one of the best PC ports I've ever played and ran flawlessly from start to finish. This to me proves they are more than capable but chose not to put in the same level of time, resources and effort. Uncharted ran at 100+ FPS on Max settings while The Last of Us Part 1 struggles to maintain 60fps on medium settings. Uncharted also looks a hell of a lot better yet uses far less of my GPU's processing power. This just confuses me, as presumably its the same game engine they are running on?

For anyone who has yet to play The Last of Us, it's a brilliant game and well worth your time, however you might do better to either play the remastered version on PS4 or wait another year or two for more patches on this one. They certainly have not been quick the patch the current problems out. I chose to wait until now to allow for some patching to take place, however as soon as I loaded the game Joel's hair was glitching out and totally ruining the experience. In addition to this, my already questionable frame rate was dropping significantly during rainy scenes and remained somewhat inconsistent throughout my last couple hours.

What bewilders me the most is that the developers and producers knew full well that this was going to be a huge AAA release and chose to still release the game in its alpha-like, bug ridden state. It's as though they didn't care at all about the possibility of the initial negative reviews. We expected better from you Naughty Dog, and whoever else helped with your port. We know you are capable of greatness, but in this instance, you let your fans down.

I will change this review to positive if you fix the terrible frame rate issues and the graphics glitches."

I've avoided purchasing this game for months because of the same negative reviews that YOU have been seeing. I read and researched into many complaints over those months and gained enough confidence on the situation to make the purchase, so good news. If you have had many questions about these bad reviews, I have some answers. 

  Is this a poor job of a port? Yes absolutely. Has this game crashed multiple times for many people? Yes. Are there more strict hardware requirements? Yes. Does this mean that its a random roulette of weather or not this game is going to work for you? No... So lets get into it. 

  This is a demanding, inefficiently ported title. The hardware requirements have a bar that must be reached, in which if you are below, you will likely encounter problems. Reportedly, that bar begins at: 

GPU 6600xt/3060ti range (will cover VRAM shortly)
CPU ryzen 5/equivalent

  If you have this hardware, you *CAN* get this game to work just fine for you (will discuss steps at the end). If you have hardware beneath this bar, some have reported they can run it at 720p.
VRAM. VRAM requirements begin at 8GB, as the game will reserve all of that. It will still play, but more than 8GB of VRAM is *highly recommended. 

Lets talk about the crashes. It appears that the most common cause of the game crashes that many have experienced comes from starting game play before allowing the shaders to load. There is strong evidence for this in addition to reported resolved issues by allowing the shaders to load. Minimum requirement hardware users report this step can take over an hour to complete. Higher end hardware users report 5-15 minutes. You only need to let the shaders load once after install.

Now a more serious quirk that isnt addressed enough is the danger to ICUE software users. This port will try to highjack your ICUE settings upon first launch to link your LED's to the game play. Why is this dangerous? Well if your CPU cooler is running with ICUE, your coolant pump can turn off (like mine did), your fans can all turn off, etc... You can disable this quickly in the game main menu by turning off software integrations in settings. Crashes are linked to this issue. 

  So lets go over the steps to make the game work. 
1. Meet the minimum hardware requirements (Nvidia gpu's might need an extra step for shaders)
2. Let the shaders load completely before beginning game play. 
3. If you have ICUE, disable software/RGB integrations in the main menu settings. (You can do this while the shaders are loading).

  -My experience with this title so far and some thoughts-
Upon following the 3 mentioned steps, I have encountered no problems with the game at all. Im using a 6700xt GPU(oc/uv) and a r7 7700x CPU.  I am averaging 90fps at 1080p ultra settings. The game hasnt crashed. The game hasnt lagged. The game is working fine. I will update this post if it ever does. I am not expecting it to. 
The port job is lazy and probably went to the lowest bidder. Your hardware wont give you as much as it normally does for this game. The game is from 2013 and expensive at $60 for some strange reason,
but its still a great play and if you follow the mentioned first-start steps, you very likely arent going to encounter problems. 

So with this, I recommend this game, as it will work fine under *conditions,* and used the thumbs down because buying and playing a game shouldnt require this much research and work. 
I hope this cleared things up for you.

At least the game runs where AK would barely would run without crashing or at least I thought. For many there will come a point where the game will constantly crashing every few minutes for me this was the dam area. People will tell you it is resizable bar or something or another, but it doesn't always fix the problem. The only advice I can give is to keep pushing through the area into the next and the crashes will happen less and less frequently until they just completely stop. Extremely frustrating when most of the game runs fine minus the various non game breaking bugs. Dynamic lights pixelating on enemies, enemies reset to spawn points, falling through the world, camera going through walls showing out of bounds areas (this happens at ton), etc. The amount of bugs, which I would have thought would have been fixed at this point is staggering. 

Some of the pros are the lighting and the texture work in this game is some of the very best you will see in a game. I don't think there is a another game out there with textures as detailed as this game if you can run it that high. On Samsung's 57"" dual 4k the detail is mind-boggling. Also if you haven't play this game it is one of the very best stories told in games. 

But I would seriously skip it until it is either fixed or seriously discounted. They do not deserve your money if they are not going to fix the game.

All in all, when the damn game works it's a masterpiece. Elements from The Last of Us Part II like game play modifiers and a revamped HUD and more have made it into a now remade 2013 game we all know and love.

Okay. 

Some (game play) hours later, when I last left off, I said that when the game works it's a masterpiece. And I still stand by that statement. But I've also run into another absolutely ridiculous issue that is completely unacceptable when you take time to consider just how BIG Naughty Dog is.

The achievements are bugged. I am not joking. A company this big remade a game with a bunch of nice improvements and what not and somehow managed to mess up achievement triggers.

There's an achievement that makes you have to listen to all of a certain characters jokes, 3 to be exact, to unlock it. My first time through the game, I did that. Guess what? I check back, turns out according to steam that I got NONE of the triggers, so I had to do it all over again.

The saddening thing about this is that it's not even exclusive to the PC port, players on PS5 have also been having this same issue, meaning they have to replay sections of the game and recollect shit they've already gotten before if they want all the achievements. 

Everything I had expressed before this edit still holds true to me, but if you do consider buying this game, just be prepared for it to irk your nerves.

Not because it's too hard, but because it's a genuinely buggy mess."

The intense threats are NOT there. This is just a typical linear story with basic mechanics that does not separate itself from others. I will continue to play hoping this turns around but by now i should be loving this game. Picked it up for $20 and I want $15 back.
It played just fine for me. 9900k 3080 1440p. I know people were complaining when it first dropped. So maybe that's been fixed. 

I would recommend DaysGone, or Hogwarts Legacy over this game 100%

An unacceptable lack of optimisation. It took 10 minutes to load shaders, then THIRTY-FIVE minutes to load when New Game was selected.
Now, in the gameplay itself, it is generally really good, however, there are textures on some objects that have delayed render.
The cutscenes... oh, the cutscenes, well, sometimes they flow just fine, but it is not uncommon for freezes, glitches, and character models shifting positions in a manner that looks like damn teleportation. When a cutscene flows into gameplay, the glitches can carry over, so you can pull the trigger for your gun, then the world freezes for 2 seconds, and then the gun finishes firing.
There is a reason this game is held in such high regard, so it's a pity we don't get that.

Oh, also, the price tag is obscene. I don't care how ""remastered"" a game is, if it was released originally a decade ago, then the price it had then, should not still be the price now. (I did buy it during this sale for 30% off, but I think indignation is still valid."

I was expecting that the game would've been somewhat optimized with the recent updates that it got, and while the current state is much better than what was on release, there's still a lot of polishing left to do.

As I've stated on my review, ""I literally spent 7 hours troubleshooting the graphical settings here and there, while going through the game just to be met up with a lot of stutters that ruin the gameplay"". I had to build the shaders 3 times, and took a good 3 hours in total for them to all be compiled. 5 hours of gameplay that was constantly met with changing graphical settings, messing with unofficial FSR3+FG mods that also hit a good amount of lows (due to again, the horrible optimization), making the game unplayable.

Interestingly, I'm using hardware that meets the recommended specs on a performance scale (RTX 3060 TI + Ryzen 5 3600). Despite the GPU surpassing the recommended specs, I'm surprised that the game, which supposedly matches my system requirements, struggles to run. I felt like I fell into the void of false advertising from the developers.
I genuinely regret buying this game and spending 8 hours of my life on such an unpolished, unoptimized port, that I'd rather spend it on another quality game that is much better optimized. I can't deny that it's much better than what we got when it came out though, but there's still a lot of polishing left to do.

I love this series and I personally see The Last Of Us as one of the most compelling video games of all time, I simply cannot recommend this specific port of the game in it's current state. I feel that merely the fact that my very expensive hardware capable of out performing a current gen console ten times over should not be barely hitting sixty frames per second only with the most performance heavy DLSS enabled. I can name many games I've played this year that arguably should be more taxing to run that I simply ran into no performance issues with. All of this is not accounting for the average PC gamer who's experience is likely to be a lot worse. Only purchase this if you are sure you can run it properly and if not, idk maybe just play it on a friends PS5.

Edit after finishing game: To anyone thinking of disregarding this review or giving it a clown reaction emoji, I'd like to clarify that it's likely not to be a terrible experience for those with mid range newer hardware in your computers, but there are too many people running on gtx 1650s and even gtx 1080s for a game to HEAVILY require dlss in most cases and be seen as a success. performance saving options like dlss are a good evolution of technology, but should never be required to reach stable frame rates or even hit that sixty fps mark.

With a 4070 and the settings at the default the game suggested, I hit a point in an early transition area where a side character was helping Joel up over a barrier and my framerate dropped to sub-1 FPS. I had to alt+F4 out and go back to reduce all of my graphics settings to get it functioning again.

Despite this, the game is still hit with stuttering at frequent intervals and constant ""texture pop"" during cut scenes. 

The game itself is ehh, okay. The main story is around 12 hours long, and that was with plenty of exploring and backtracking, so nothing world-shattering. 

The story suffers from the usual post-apocalyptic story issues, where side characters only exist to create moral quandaries for the main character either by dying, betraying you or betraying you and dying. And something about the second half of the game, where there's frequent large time skips and jumps between locations just left me feeling like something was missing. It's not bad, just... eh. That's the best I can say for it.

To be honest, if you've got access to a playstation capable of playing this I'd probably recommend just getting it on there rather than fecking around with the optimisation mess that this game offers."

What the hell is with this game needing so much? Owning a RTX 3070, 32gb of VRAM, and UHD 770 I can pretty much handle almost every single modern game out there, To get this to run at Ultra Settings all the way through, you need a computer made by goddamn NASA, I have seen plenty of games that look so much better than this ""Remake"" and yet I can run those games at the highest settings without my rig breaking so much as a sweat, But since this game is pretty poorly optimized (At least in my opinion) I had to follow a specific video on YouTube, which really did help me run this game at 60fps and Above. And if you really want to be one of those people that classifies this as a from the ground up ""Remake"" then you really have no clue what a Remake is, Play RE4 Remake, play Destroy All Humans 1 & 2, those are from the ground up full blown remakes, Yes the visuals in TLOU ""Remake"" are beautiful, you'd have to be a moron to not acknowledge that at least, But you cannot just port slight animation changes (which you ripped from TLOU 2) and consider that being a ""Remake"" which for some reason you charge full price for (thank steam for the sales) but at least you didn't charge $70 for it. Another thing I was kinda sick of in this ""Remake"" was the fact that now (for some reason) you added animations for the Workbench and added the Manual Safe Entry minigame in this, now what the hell was the reason for that? It's not bad the first few times, some of the animations are cool at first, but do I really need to waste 5-10 seconds watching Joel poke his Shotgun with a pair of pliers? It made me miss the hold the button down for a few seconds then move onto the next thing, And I honestly don't like the manual safe input, again cool at first, but gets old after the first time you do it, for those who don't know, you had to find a note or something that had a safe code on it and you just pressed a button and watched a quick animation play out, now it just takes longer. Overall the experience of the game is really great though, It's the same Last of Us we knew and loved back in 2013, packed in with its respective DLC Left Behind, which you can get through in about an hour or an hour fifteen. You got different ways you can handle situations in the game, no real bad outcome to whatever choice you make it's not a Telltale Game, just which option will save you more ammo or not. But I really do think i would've been happier if they just ported the PS4 Remaster to the PC due to all the bugs and issues this game had with graphics, occasionally you would see some Black Squares as well. It isn't an awful option though, it's fair if you have never played TLOU before and want to experience it since you never touched a PS3 or PS4, then this is a good buy... if you got the right rig for it. But overall... I really would ONLY recommend it on sale any time it is $40 or less, i'd leap on it. But i wanted to at least try it so I wouldn't here some dumb shit say ""But you never had your hands on the controller, so clearly you have no clue what your talking about"" Don't worry homeboy, I've known it since the beginning, which is why I waited for a sale first."

In spite of that good bit, I can't recommend the game. This game constantly drags you where it wants you to go and I don't mean its linear map. I've played linear map games I enjoyed, however the best analogy I came up is imagine your supposed to fly a plane but instead of being the pilot your the co-pilot with the pilot telling you to raise flaps, radio the tower, lower the gear, etc. That's exactly what this game felt like, I was along for the ride and being told what to do instead of taking my own actions. My choices didn't matter, my actions were scripted to fit into a narrow band of options, and I was like the audience watching rather than an the actor doing. There was too many things that went this way to mention, but I noticed even ammo drops were manipulated. For example I saw two drops of a certain ammo during a fight near me, after I picked up one and headed for the second I saw it disappear in front me before I got close enough to pick it up. I noticed in other cases too when I went back to get an ammo drop I passed while fighting they were gone when I came back. This game constantly made me follow the a tight script including actions and fights, that ruined the game play for me. I finished it and wouldn't play it again, or a sequel like it."

Regardless of other peoples' review about how the game crashes constantly, with my RTX4090, 13900K, DDR5 64MB of ram... I thought I would have the chance to play it smoothly but I was WRONG.  The game does not allow me to advance from the title screen.  It crashes before I could even complete my new game settings (no matter how fast I do it).  I did everything I can to my knowledge to fix this problem but to no avail... I tried verifying the integrity of the file, uninstalled and installed it again, restarted STEAM, restarted my PC, etc...  I bought this Steam game through a 3rd party website at a discount but once I have the activation code activated, I'm not allowed for a refund but this is just ridiculous.

It seems they haven't done anything about it.  IT'S BEEN MONTHS.  They seem to not care at all about the people who can't even play the game due to crashing.

lets get the good out of the way: The Last of Us (2013) has always been a shining example of the best of the Sony catalog and often considered one of the best games of all time. This is still pretty much true--the story of Joel and Ellie is written brilliantly, paced wonderfully, and acted/soundtracked beautifully. The story has actual consistent themes and ideas that reflect in each character, rarely if ever feels contrived or otherwise unrealistic, and the end will stick with you for some time.

Gameplay is a standard mix of third person shooting, exploration and some puzzle solving, and brutal melee combat. Genre-wise, its going for the survival/panic horror idea, so expect some good monster design, limited ammo, and slower deliberate movement. Stealth is always advised and achieved in most cases by crouching out of sight and taking enemies down from behind. 

This port looks better in every way. Graphics look lush and animations, especially facial ones are top-notch; the original game was probably the best looking game of the seventh generation of consoles, and its PS4 remaster remained solid looking throughout the eighth. Some face models were redesigned, Tess in particular looks much more like her actor, Annie Wersching (RIP). The updated engine allows for better lighting and shadow work all around. The quality of the reflection mapping made me think it was ray tracing (its not, its just really dang good). Performance is fine on my Ryzen 5 2600x/RX 6700XT combo (high settings), but certainly still leaves a lot to be desired.

Enemy AI from Part 2 makes its appearance here, without the near-constant callouts of people's names in a cheap but realistic attempt to guilt you. Human enemies will stick with friends when alerted, react to the sound of you being out of ammo, but are relentless. Infected behave slightly differently than originally, being more active and moving more when alerted, clickers in particular, leading to stealth encounters often feeling similar but slightly harder.

Safecracking from Part 2 also gets to appear in this remake. Originally, you had to find the note with the code on it. While those notes still exist, you have to manually enter the code, and if you haven't found the note, you can crack the safe by hear, which is rather satisfying to do.

now for the complaints and why I don't recommend this game to anyone who still has a PS4 or has played the game before.
-This should not qualify as a remake, despite claims otherwise. This is a remaster with some remade models and textures and an updated engine. As such, logical gameplay benefits from Part 2 (dodging, prone crawling) make no appearance hear, despite the minimal impact they would present on balancing.

- new upgrade animations are weird. at best, they add aesthetics to the gun or you can see the realistic approach. however, sometimes they are baffling, such as the fact that the level 2 revolver fire rate animation is just oiling the gun (shoulda been level 1), other times, they are obscured entirely by Joel's shoulder, making it impossible for you to even tell what he's doing.

-Performance hog, this just eats resources, i wouldn't recommend running it with any less than 12 GBs of VRAM.

-this is not worth full price nor is it worth the $40 or so they've put it on sale for so far, AT ALL. Nor is the digital deluxe content worth paying for. First, the game lacks Factions mode, the original's and remaster's multiplayer--this is frankly egregious, especially after plans for a separate free to play version were canned. The MP in this game is really good, playing on a cat and mouse-esque dynamic as players stalked each other through maps; at any point gunfire could break out between the sides or you could have a sharp thing jammed into your neck from behind. it was tense, it was brutal, and it deserves to be played by everyone. 2, they've done the absolute bare minimum here (and maybe thats unfair, but it certainly feels that way). C, if you've still got a PS4, dust it off. The remaster is like 10 bucks on the PS Store or at your local games shop, it has the Left Behind DLC and some of the digital deluxe stuff already baked in, and you CAN STILL PLAY FACTIONS with a fairly active community. Its just not worth anything when a more feature complete version is a sixth of the price. It speaks to what I'm frankly assuming is the start of the downfall of the once brilliant Naughty Dog, and some really shitty behind the scenes decisions at Sony."

721,0,0.7414,"story, last, also, character, gameplay, feel, instead, present, hype, find","Although I wrote the review of this game as the positive recommendation, but it has changed my mind since the PSN restriction policy of other Sony's games such as Ghost of Tsuchima, God of war Ragnarok and Until dawn, and sooner or later, Sony will soon apply this policy to the other games.

I. Graphic review
The game brings a new level of visual fidelity to the beloved classic.he game features stunningly detailed environments, character models, and textures, all enhanced by the capabilities of modern PC hardware. The post-apocalyptic world is rendered with incredible realism, with meticulously crafted landscapes and atmospheric effects that immerse players in the desolate beauty of the setting. Lighting and shadow effects are particularly noteworthy, adding depth and intensity to the game's various locales. The improved frame rates and resolution options available on PC ensure a smooth and visually impressive experience, making the most of the platform's graphical potential.

II. Gameplay review
The gameplay remains as engaging and intense as ever. The blend of survival, stealth, and action elements creates a gripping and challenging experience. Players must carefully manage resources, navigate dangerous environments, and engage in tactical combat. The AI of both enemies and allies is intelligent, providing a realistic and dynamic challenge. The crafting system adds a layer of strategy, requiring players to make critical decisions about resource allocation. The game's controls are responsive and can be customized to suit different play styles, with options for both keyboard and mouse or gamepad. The PC version also benefits from fast load times, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
The Last of Us Part 1 is renowned for its compelling and emotionally charged narrative. The story follows Joel and Ellie as they journey through a post-apocalyptic world, forming a deep and complex bond. The writing is exceptional, with well-developed characters and a plot that explores themes of survival, loss, and humanity. The voice acting and motion capture performances are top-notch, bringing the characters to life in a way that resonates deeply with players. The story's pacing is masterfully handled, balancing moments of intense action with quieter, more introspective scenes that allow for character development and emotional depth. It is a narrative experience that stays with players long after the game is finished.

III. Performance review
One of the most significant improvement for the PC version is the crashing issues, sometimes plays smoothly and crashes continuously due to the hardware temperature and performance although my hardware has reach beyond the recommended game's specification. Some players have reported encountering technical issues, including performance hiccups, crashes, and optimization issues on certain hardware configurations. While these issues may be addressed through future patches and updates, they can detract from the overall experience for some players.

IV. Reliability
Sony's decision to restrict from selling the games that released this year in 180 countries is deeply concerning. This move appears to be a significant oversight in a world that increasingly values global connectivity. By limiting access to PSN, Sony is not only disenfranchising a substantial number of players but also missing out on the potential growth and innovation that could arise from these diverse markets. This restriction impedes players in these countries from participating in the broader PlayStation ecosystem, including access to digital contents, and even the latest updates for the specific game. For a brand that is celebrated for its cutting-edge technology and commitment to enhancing user experiences, such a restrictive policy seems counterproductive. It sends a message that these regions are not valued, which could harm Sony's reputation and hinder its global expansion efforts. Globalization should be at the forefront of any modern gaming strategy and Sony's current approach falls short of this ideal.
Removing these restrictions would not only expand Sony's reach but also align with the growing demand for accessible gaming experiences worldwide. It would allow plasers from these restricted countries to fully participate in Sony's games, contributing to a richer community and potentially unlocking new market opportunities for Sony.
Although I really love this game, but it has changed my mind since the PSN restriction policy of other Sony's games such as Ghost of Tsuchima, God of war Ragnarok and Until dawn, and sooner or later, Sony will soon apply this policy to the other games. And even though I buy the PS5 or later PlayStation version console, it is hard by 2 reason:
1. My region is not support PSN, and even though I created the account from another regions that supported the PSN, the account will be banned sooner or later.
2. Lack data synchronization across multiple devices

V. Conclusion
The Last of Us Part 1 on PC is a visually stunning and deeply engaging game that brings a classic narrative to a new audience. The enhanced graphics and smooth performance make it a standout title on the platform. The gameplay is intense and satisfying, with a blend of survival, stealth, and action elements that challenge and engage players. The story is emotionally compelling, with well-developed characters and a plot that explores profound themes.
Reconsidering and removing these restrictions on selling games in 180 countries that don't have PSN would be a positive step towards enhancing global gaming and ensuring that all players have equal opportunities to enjoy all Sony's games."

The game Itself as we all know is a masterpiece but its optimization is complete dogsh** . Even with what i said above its still likely you'll drop alotta frames at certain points and get a stutter or two.  
When you first load the game its going to be downloading shaders and your CPU will go straight up to 100% for the entire duration. This should go without saying but do not try to play the game when its doing that, just wait.
Lastly If anyone is using Msi afterburner / Rivatuner overlay , Dont because pressing the keybind to enable that overlay will immediately crash the game. (I tried 3 times and it crashed immediately all 3 times)
Overall the story and game itself is fantastic but still and probably always will run like absolute trash sadly. There are still people getting a few bugs happening that i myself have not come across as of yet but that's just yet another potential negative still.
For the poor optimization alone and you needing quite a decent bit above the recommended specs to run the game somewhat smoothly I'm giving it a negative review."

785,0,0.5252,"story, last, also, character, gameplay, feel, instead, present, hype, find","SPOILERS 

Until the last 5 minutes of the game, I loved the father / daughter relationship and it looked like I'd be replaying this game a ton. The combat is great - the weapons, finding ammo, needing to use melee / bricks / bottles / stealth kills / bow to avoid activating all enemies at once, the way Ellie would do her own thing here and there instead of just staying 2 feet from you at all times like most games - how you didn't have to worry about the other characters exposing us while we're hiding and so much more. The (so you thought) development of caring between Joel and Ellie was working out really well (meaning the writers doing this).

Then suddenly in the last 5 minutes of the game, they totally destroy all of it, making the man a psycho who will tell a MASSIVE set of lies to the girl so she will now go live with him as a family, and also trash her trust for him making him ""swear that what you said is 100% true"". So now it's clear she really doesn't trust him. And the writers have him say 'yes' without flinching, which only a psycho could pull off after telling such a MASSIVE set of lies.

The potential father / daughter love between them was a very strong point of this game, which would easily make me want to replay it given all the other aspects mentioned above.

Games with strong points like this make people want to REPLAY it.  That's what game developers WANT: people to play it and REPLAY it. That should drive all your decisions.

""Not us! In spite of 99% of the game's character and relationship development, let's trash all of that at the end and instead turn one of the two main characters into a lying psychotic just to manipulate her to going back to live with him, and let's show the other main character doesn't trust the other either! We were just fooling you the entire game that their relationship, trust and caring was growing stronger - who cares if it ruins what would have been a great story that people would love replaying - let's just trash it all - I'm sure everyone will love us trashing it just as much!""

It would be like Resident Evil 2 remake with Claire, where Claire just kills Sherry's mom, then lies to Sherry and says a zombie got her, and telling Sherry that before her mom died that her mom told Claire that she's not even Sherry's mom and that she never did like Sherry, then Claire having Sherry leave with her to go see where she lives and move in with her. Then Sherry asking ""Swear to me that all of this is 100% true"" - ""Yes"" (without flinching). That would completely destroy that game as well.

Don't know if this will change, but in the span of that 5 minutes at the end, now I have no desire to replay the game since you know the writers are just out to pretend the man and girl are growing together, their relationship and caring growing, and instead at the end trash all of it and just instead have him be a psycho that will tell her MASSIVE lies to have his fake family with her and she doesn't trust him anyway.

Epic fail by the writers. Epic failure by the company for approving that stupidity as if that would be ""better"" and ""more fun"" for those who play it.

Given the ton of woke content in the game that is very blatant, I should have seen it coming. I was overlooking all of the blatant woke trash because the relationship between the two and how it was growing was so well done and it made me want to replay the game. Until the last 5 minutes of the game, it was looking to be one I'd replay a ton. 

Now I despise it.

Like many have said, the game builds shaders at first and, for the most part, it looks and feels great.

I don't get to play games for hours on end. Games get started and stopped all the time. In my experience after a few starts and stops of the game the shaders ""go bad"" for lack of a better word. I need to force rebuild them or the game will have terrible stutter even if I lower the settings to low quality.

Deleting the PSOLIb (in the app folder) forces a shader refresh and then the game is right as rain until....it isn't. Sometimes even hitting the pause button will cause the game to go from buttery smooth to a stuttering mess. 

I like the story. It's just too bad it's a hassle to play.

The port is just badly done and since they don't seem to be fixing it or are incapable of it, it feels like a money grab.

After finishing the game on the PC-version shortly after its release, I wanted to play New Game+ after some months had passed.
I thought I would find the weird hair rendering issue fixed, aswell as my rifle scope finally working instead of being black/unusable (as in I literally cant see through it).
This is already annoying, but many people seem to still experience crashes and performance issues. I had 1-2 crashes the first week after release but nothing that bad. I tend to be quite lucky with not having any performance issues in games even when people say they are riddled with them, so maybe it was just my luck again.

But any of these issues persisting this late after release is not cool. And my 2 issues still happen frequently so that its annoying and ruins the immersion. The cutscenes may look semi-funny at first with the weird hair rendering but it gets old quick.

For reference I just played through Halo Infinite who's game world is significantly bigger and requires a larger rendering budget, the AI is more sophisticated as well.

The truth is, this is one of my favorite stories of all time and I absolutely love the last of us. I had it on PS3, but when I switched to PC, I couldn't play the game since I had to sell all my consoles to afford the PC. Now that it's been almost a decade since then and the sequel is out, I don't know how to feel anymore. 

Firstly, The game was a complete mess when it came out. I wont spend much time on that, but from my end, they've totally fixed the performance issues. That doesn't really effect my opinion too much because those issues never should have been there in the first place, but at least they fixed them. MAKE SURE YOU LOAD YOUR SHADERS BEFORE PLAYING THE GAME! IT DOESNT TAKE LONG! JUST WAIT!

Next, the game is great. Its The Last of Us of course, and its fantastic. The remaster is awesome, and I'm glad it's on PC, because every game should be, obviously. 

The thing that I hate the most is that the sequel is actually terrible. You may be wondering, ""You don't have a playstation, how have you played it?"" Well, my friends are dumb enough to give sony money for subpar hardware to play video games so I watched their playthrough, and its actually a godawful sequel. Probably the worst sequel of all time.

Maybe I'm just an idiot (that is probably the case ngl) but the sequel ruins the story of The Last of Us. I dont wanna get into it too much but it just makes the entire story feel worthless, and It's hard to give Naughty Dog money for ruining one of my favorite games. I should seek help, I know. 

Im not going to refund the game because it's awesome not just because I can play this game again, but I can play it properly on PC after something like 7 years of not playing it. However, I am going to leave a negative review because of what I've already mentioned, and also the fact that they are charging $60 for a game that was released a decade ago. I know its got a cool new coat of paint on it and all, but for fucks sake, get over yourselves.

Loved this game since launch, played through twice on PS3, twice on PS4, and was not going to get the PC port because of the criticisms of the coding. Eventually I'll get a PS5 so I was holding off for that. But my sister, a devoted fan, is coming to visit and I want her to experience the remaster in 4k on my OLED TV so against my better judgement I bought it here.

Started a playthrough to unlock every chapter for sis, that way she can dip into whichever part of the story she wants. Everything was great for the first half of the game; every now and then I saw a slight hitch when transitioning between gameplay and cinematics but that was it. Then I got to the sewers.

When they first opened the door and triggered the sound trap at the beginning of the abandoned living area in the sewers, the stutters hit hard and did not stop. The game gets so choppy it becomes unplayable. This is intermittent and can be mitigated somewhat by reloading the checkpoint, but results are spotty. I'm continuing the playthrough because sis arrives tomorrow night but it has become a chore. I've made it into the suburbs and am now sneaking up on the sniper and the chop is still intruding on my game.

This is obviously not a hardware issue because my specs are more than enough to run the game smoothly and my rig has done so for the first 14 hours of play. Even when the chop hits my FPS counter still reads between 50-70 so it is not a graphical issue at all; it has to be this shitty poorly coded port. 

It pains me to downvote this game but 7 months after its PC release it is downright unethical to sell it in this condition. I'm going to play it with my sister this weekend to see what we can get out of the experience then see if I can talk Steam into a refund because this is broken-ass bullshit. Very disheartened."

I'm playing this port several months after release and the amount of graphical bugs in the first ten minutes has me regretting the key I bought. I have my settings on low-med and am only managing 50fps in an enclosed room. There's something very wrong with AA as well, edges look absolutely atrocious and the sharpening for DLSS is completely broken.
I spent the first hour and a half of my playtime troubleshooting the graphical bugs, only to find out that it's just the game being absolute trash. Not what I want to waste my time on. Whoever green lit this game, slapped that $60 price tag on there and said ""Yup, she's done!"" needs an intervention, because, Dear God, they must be completely blind.

I purchased this game thinking that they would have fixed the launch issues, but no. To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. If you have great memories of this game with beautiful environments, amazing story, and memorable characters- go play the original remaster. This port will tarnish those memories, and does not deserve to share its name with the original."

I did expect the graphics to be a complete improvement from the original, but this is a ""remaster"" of sorts so theyve improved easy things like the post processing, lighting, animations ,etc. that wont supersede their budget. What I dislike about this game is the few issues that I have come across. Some involve my camera going haywire to the point where I am in the void, and Im currently running part 2 and I cannot win the watergun fight because I cannot spray Riley, it does not detect me hitting her even though she reacts to it and comes out drenched at the end (assuming it isnt something youre guaranteed to see even without hitting her once). The camera clipping I got to fix by restarting the game and the watergun fight is something permanent since I restarted twice and still have that issue (it might be a save issue but that rarely happens to me with any game so i doubt it). So 100% ing this is impossible (at least for me), but the game itself is still an astonishment from whatever crap larger brands have come out with recently.

I can only speak on behalf of watching because i am waiting until I can afford a high end computer in order to play at the highest graphic settings. This game is very story driven, this means no side quests from what Ive seen, no exploration like in dying light, etc. The story is very unique, well thought, well made and played parallel with exceptional acting. The environment is so detailed, well animated and textured. The sound design is accurate, the Ai's reaction is accurate, and just the idea in general is unique and follows a very different type of story compared to what we come across now a days. Even though this game came out on ps4 in 2013, it is still one of the best games I have ever seen, even if people are complaining that its still priced at 70 bucks when the newest call of duty is of that price yet full of hackers, bugs, cosmetics which people attacked techland for adding in dying light 2 and so on.

with that in mind, The Last of us Part 1 gets 4/10 from me, for the story telling, memorable cutscenes and levels.
there is a lot of connection to the story characters, and the way the developers managed to delivers content across the game.

there are many cool things to do with combat, and it's on the easier side of difficulty across games (played first run - on HARD)

many good things could be said on the animations on the Cutscenes and play, but many also seem to not work very well with Mouse+Keyboard aim and movments while free roaming.
which happens a lot with a ported games from Playstation latley... like God of war for example.

I bet this game would have gotten higher score if played more smoothly on my machine.
it's just a shame it doesn't. and it will never be fixed probably.

Naughty Dog, known for their exceptional storytelling and character development, captivated audiences with ""The Last of Us Part I."" The game's original release on PlayStation was a masterclass in immersive storytelling, delivering an emotionally charged experience that left players in tears, filled with rage, and warmed their hearts. The port of this game to the PC, however, was handled by Iron Galaxy, and it regrettably fell short of expectations, leaving players with a less-than-optimal experience. This article critically examines the PC port, the technical issues it faces, and the choices made by Sony in entrusting Iron Galaxy with the task, all while considering the hardware requirements.



Before diving into the specifics of the PC port, it's essential to acknowledge the remarkable storytelling prowess of Naughty Dog. ""The Last of Us Part I"" was an emotional rollercoaster, featuring deeply relatable characters and a post-apocalyptic world that felt both bleak and beautiful. The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the heart of the narrative, and players were drawn into their struggles and triumphs, shedding tears over the heart-wrenching decisions and sharing their moments of happiness.

The narrative was beautifully layered with complex characters, ethical dilemmas, and a vividly crafted world, all contributing to the emotional impact of the game. Naughty Dog's ability to engage players on such a deep emotional level is a testament to their storytelling expertise.



While the PC gaming community was thrilled to see ""The Last of Us Part I"" making its way to the platform, the excitement turned to disappointment upon experiencing the PC port. Iron Galaxy, a company not known for their exemplary porting abilities, took on the task of bringing this beloved title to the PC. Unfortunately, it became evident that the port had several technical issues that significantly hindered the overall experience.



One of the most glaring issues with the PC port is its performance problems. Many players reported frame rate drops, stutters, and other performance-related issues. Even high-end hardware configurations, like the RTX 4080 and i9-1300k, struggled to maintain smooth gameplay, which was a disappointment given the game's age and the capabilities of modern PC hardware.



Sony, who owns Nixxes, a company with a history of successful game porting, left many scratching their heads when they chose to entrust Iron Galaxy with this crucial task. It was a missed opportunity to deliver a high-quality PC port that could have introduced a new audience to the masterpiece that is ""The Last of Us Part I."" Nixxes' expertise and track record with PC ports could have been a game-changer for the experience.



Another issue with the PC port lies in its demanding hardware requirements. To run the game without encountering performance problems, players are practically required to have an RTX 4090, an extremely powerful and expensive GPU. Such high hardware demands alienate a significant portion of the PC gaming community, leaving them unable to enjoy the game in its full glory.


For many players, the stutters in the PC port of ""The Last of Us Part I"" were a significant source of frustration. Stutters not only disrupt the immersion but can also make gameplay less enjoyable. It's disappointing that a game of this caliber suffered from such technical issues on the PC platform, especially when the original PlayStation version was so highly regarded for its optimization.



In conclusion, ""The Last of Us Part I"" by Naughty Dog remains a masterpiece of storytelling, character development, and world-building. The emotional journey it offers is unparalleled. However, the PC port, handled by Iron Galaxy, leaves much to be desired. The technical issues, high hardware requirements, and the choice of developer for the port are all sources of disappointment for PC gamers.

It is unfortunate that a game that had the potential to be a remarkable addition to the PC gaming library fell short due to these issues. For those with the necessary hardware and patience to work through the technical hiccups, the emotional depth of ""The Last of Us Part I"" can still be experienced. However, it serves as a reminder that even the most exceptional games can falter when not given the proper care and attention in their transition to a new platform. The gaming community can only hope that future PC ports receive the attention they deserve, allowing more players to enjoy the beauty of games like ""The Last of Us Part I."""

The graphics selection and tweaking options are way too saturated to the point that even if you are knowledgeable, you just cannot fix random stuttering, low FPS in cinematics and pre-load zone FPS drops. It's just too overwhelming.

I have a mid-high end hardware and this is the first game that I cannot fix without ruining the overall quality even with FSR 2.0.

I don't know if I just got lucky or not, but letting the shaders recompile during gameplay meant the black scope and everything else was actually fixed by recompiling and didn't keep reoccurring. Sure, it happened a few more times, but I could get rid of it and was able to finish my playthrough. This is an amazing game with a 10/10 story and pretty dated gameplay. Everyone should play it, but I still recommend not playing it like this.

I'm left saddened by my experience with this version of The Last of Us. Everything was going well for the first few chapters, until I got a scope for my rifle and it was bugged and blacked out. Looking online this is a common occurrence, and has to do with shader compilation. Verifying the game files so the shaders recompile fixed this for a bit, and for a while I would do this whenever I wanted to play. Eventually though this stopped working.

The blacked out scope is only the most egregious symptom of this bug though. It also causes black outlines around transparencies like the arrows in your backpack, and also for Joel's eyebrows to have a black outline that makes them look very bushy.

I love The Last of Us. I originally played the remastered version on PS4 and it's the best story I've ever played in a game, and my emotional connection to Joel and Ellie goes far beyond any other characters in media as a whole. Films and games never make me cry, but several scenes in this game and the sequel get me every time. I cannot overstate how unique this is for me, and so I really hold these games in a special place.

The bugs in this version ruin this experience. I want to get immersed and lost in the moment, to for a time get lost with my favourite characters, but instead I'm repeatedly ripped out of the experience and the message ""YOU'RE PLAYING A BROKEN PORT"" is inescapable. I'm not playing this version any more, I don't want my love for the series to be further tainted by it."

[b]2nd playthrough[/b]

AMD 6800xt MSI Gaming Trio Z
Ryzen 7600x
32GB Ram DDR5 6000mhz Expo

I received the game for free as part of AMD's GPU bundle. I waited a long time for this game to come to PC, and was very excited to play In fact I played through it twice! I played the game with the recommend 1440p  specs for high settings 60fps. I couldn't stream and play at same time at 60fps without a massive CPU bottleneck which was unfortunate. So I decided to run at 4k ultra preset 30fps for the rest of the playthrough, and was able to stream it just fine. It played fine when not trying to stream, besides the 90% CPU utilization which in all fairness they sorta fixed. But almost every preset kept the CPU utilization very high anyway which sucks.
Prior to my 2nd playthrough (which I did not stream) I upgraded to Ryzen 7600x ddr5 6000mhz 32GB  CPU from Intel i7 9700k ddr4 3600mhz 32Gb. I ran the game at FSR 2 upscaled 4k at around 80fps on Custom Ultra/high settings. The Game looks phenomenal at higher settings... If you can run it. But that's not the real problem with game. The lack of optimization is the real nail coffin of this port. Every update of the game brought new bugs and random crashes. Last time I played was from a July patch which caused button input combos to crash the game, and analysis stated a GPU crash? really?! Or Random cutscene crashes causing me to replay areas over and over again. Crashing in cutscene viewer from the main menu while director commentary is playing. I have footage of the game crashing while just veering off a random path, it makes no sense. Naughty Dog isn't some no name studio, and it's unfortunate that they put so much time into the remake/remaster to have it run badly on PC. Hopefully they can fix it, because If i had payed for this game instead of getting it for free, I would have refunded it.

Those are the two faces of The Last Of Us: the good and the bad. Unfortunately, we cannot discuss the good without addressing the bad. This title is undeniably haunted by its IP owner, ""Naughty Dog,"" who seems determined, and successful, in undermining this franchise.

Full disclosure: I did not purchase the game on Steam, and I certainly did not pay $60 for it. I would recommend exploring alternatives, as this 10-year-old game does not justify the price of a new triple-A title, especially given the subpar quality of this port (keep reading for more details).

[h1] Good Game [/h1]

The Last of Us 1 marked a pivotal moment in gaming history. It emerged at the zenith of the ""zombie genre"" trend, alongside titles like Telltale's The Walking Dead, State of Decay, and 7 Days to Die. Naughty Dog had a significant challenge ahead of them. Rather than following the same style as other zombie games, TLOU distinguished itself by presenting ""zombies"" differently and focusing on story, gameplay, providing a linear character-driven experience.

For the most part, TLOU is an exceptional game; a trendsetter that redefined the way we perceive games. With its spectacular graphics, compelling characters, and the profound ""not-father & not-daughter bond"" (which I believe drew inspiration from Lee and Clementine, as some of the more somber scenes bear striking resemblance), it introduced us to deeper gaming worlds, more nuanced characters, and intricate mechanics. The scavenging, crafting, gunplay, and melee combat are all executed flawlessly and offer a highly enjoyable experience.

So, what went wrong?

[h1] Bad Devs [/h1]

The major issue with playing TLOU lies with its owner, Naughty Dog. This California-based subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment is overtly left-leaning. While the game ticks all the right boxes and addresses relevant topics, it tends to lean heavily into what's often referred to as ""woke"" (a term that, while overused, applies here). These topics include atheism, LGBTQ representation, and diversity. For instance, early on in the game, we encounter a character named Bill. The last thing I needed to know about Bill was his sexual orientation, but the game places significant emphasis on it, becoming one of the only times Joel expresses condolences in the game. Religion is also discussed by minors - an 11-year-old boy and a 14-year-old girl - as they openly express their disbelief in Heaven and make jokes about it. That same 14-year-old girl later becomes a prominent character in an lesbian relationship. What's concerning is Naughty Dog's apparent fixation on assigning LGBTQ identities to child and minor characters, doing so not once, not twice, not three times, but around four more instances. It's genuinely discomforting to contemplate. You might be wondering, how did this affect TLOU? Well, my friend, these were just the seeds of what was to come. This pattern of promoting a particular ideology would ultimately lead to Chapter 2 of the game, revealing that Naughty Dog cared more about their agenda than the integrity of the IP, even at the cost of one of their most beloved protagonists.

Now, let's talk about the PC Port. Greedy Neil Druckmann, after upsetting TLOU fans with Chapter 2, decided to hand off the PC port to a random company. Unfortunately, this port was subpar and continues to be so. Achieving over 50 fps is a challenge, particularly if you attempt to run it at anything higher than medium settings. The game frequently crashes, experiences world unloading issues, and suffers from lighting problems. It's safe to say that this port was a disaster. Many attempted to defend it by playing the ""Naughty Dog didn't handle the port"" card. Fine, but whose IP is it? Who failed to oversee the port? Who submitted it to Steam? Who has yet to acknowledge or apologize for it?

In conclusion, if TLOU 1 had been left as TLOU 1, it would have stood as a genre-defining, perhaps even industry-redefining game, worthy of praise for its stunningly detailed graphics, character-driven linear plot, and exceptional world-building. However, as time has passed, it's devolved into what every Netflix show seems to do now. It's become a political and moral sermon delivered by millionaires, imposing their opinions and worldviews on players to the point where it's no longer an addition to the game, but a lesson within the game. I find myself fatigued by this trend of pushing intrusive political beliefs, particularly those involving minors, in games where they have no place.

If you can overlook what Chapter 2 does, if you can tolerate the uncomfortable and repetitive themes of sexuality, if you can accept the 30~50 fps performance, and if you can stomach the $60 price tag for a 10-year-old game... perhaps you might find some enjoyment in it."

The Last of Us Part 1, often hailed as a masterpiece by critics and fans alike, left me profoundly disappointed and questioning the overwhelming praise it has received. While it undoubtedly has its strengths, I found several aspects of the game that left me frustrated and underwhelmed.

First and foremost, the gameplay in The Last of Us Part 1 falls short of its potential. The combat mechanics are clunky, making it a chore to engage in gunfights or melee encounters. The scarcity of ammunition and resources often leads to unnecessary frustration, as the game forces players into situations where they must resort to trial-and-error tactics rather than strategic gameplay.

The AI of both enemy and companion characters is often erratic and inconsistent. Enemies display unrealistic levels of awareness at times, making stealth an unreliable option. Conversely, your AI companions can frequently be a hindrance rather than an asset, failing to react intelligently to the danger around them and compromising your efforts to progress.

While the story of The Last of Us Part 1 is praised for its emotional depth and character development, I found it to be predictable and clichéd. The post-apocalyptic setting, overrun by a zombie-like infection, feels tired and unoriginal, lacking the fresh perspective that could have set it apart from similar narratives in the genre. Furthermore, the character of Joel, often touted as a complex anti-hero, comes across as one-dimensional and unsympathetic for much of the game.

The pacing is another significant issue. The game's narrative is often disrupted by extended sections of mundane and repetitive gameplay, such as moving ladders or planks to progress. These segments only serve to pad out the game's length without adding meaningful content or excitement.


In summary, The Last of Us Part 1 is a game that I found to be overhyped and ultimately underwhelming. Its gameplay frustrations, inconsistent AI, unoriginal storytelling. While it may have resonated with many players, I couldn't help but feel let down by the immense acclaim surrounding this title."

Pretty much a corridor game with super uningaging stealth sections and combat. Gameplay is unbelievably boring. Cutscene, walk for 5mns enduring b-movie dialogue, ARENA !!! Chest high walls for humans, sneaking for mutants. Bottles ? This level is arena is a ""stealth"" arena. Chest high walls ? Shooty bang bang humans. You win. 15mn cut scene with (b-movie) ACTORS. Walk for 5mns enduring b-movie dialogue, ARENA !!! Rinse, repeat. Can anyone explain to me what exactly was the fuss around this game about ? 

Don't really care about the cliché story and characters...so I'm left with merely nothing : clunky, uninteresting combat and equally clunky and very limited stealth sections that repeat ad nauseam...the PC version runs well as of september '23...but MAN what a boring, sleep inducing overrated crap this game is. It's not that gameplay didn't age well; it never was that good in the first place. Gunstar Heroes came out in 1996 and it's still a lot better than this. Max Payne came out in 1997 and is still A LOT better than this. S.T.A.L.K.E.R came out in 1998 and it is STILL a lot better than this.

Red dead redemption was a contemporary title and it just blows this POS right out of the water.

A prime example of a mediocre game that became a legend thanks to fanboy hysteria. A GARBAGE, DATED game that somehow gets talked about to this day...I don't get it.

I'm playing RE4 right now as well...both games are just incomparable in terms of quality, TLOU really aged like roadkill in august and I still can't believe the hype around this lazy turd of a game. 

If you feel like beying enthralled in a story and its characters, read a book or watch a movie. 
If you feel like playing a video game : play a video game. 
This just doesn't work, and collapses on itself in 2023. Hot. Overrated. Garbage. A 60 bucks B movie that drags on and on and never really delivers...a TOUGH investment.

Probably the most disapointing thing I've ever played, fanboys really need to calm down and take a breather, I lost 40 bucks on this thanks to that BS hype. 

Give this crap of a game an ending, it's beyond dead and needs to be forgotten.

-----------------

Back in the day, when it first came out, I absolutely loved The Last of Us. The storytelling and the atmosphere was and still is one of the best out there. When I heard it was also coming out on PC, I was of course over the moon.

Well... as many of you know, the launch was terrible and the game was clearly still not complete. I feel like this MUST be taken into consideration whenever anyone is commenting on this PC port. The bad performance and the glitches were not an ""accidental mistake"", it was an intentional decision by the publishers and the higher-ups to release the game at that state and hope people will still buy it and forget about it after a while.

Let me tell you guys, for a title this big and with a price even above some brand new titles, how they launched this game was totally unacceptable and that should not ever be ""forgotten"" by the fans and community.

-----------------

So, now to my experience. I haven't preordered this game or bought it any time close to launch. The version I bought it at and am currently running is v1.1.2. I do not recommend getting this game without it going on sale. The specs I have tested it on are:

- windows 11 22h2
- ryzen 5 5600x
- rtx 3060 (driver 537.13)
- 32gb ram (ddr4)

The Steam download is around 75gb. As soon as you launch the game, it will automatically start building the shaders. This means it will instantly max out your cpu until the shaders for the main game and the dlc are built. With these specs, it took around 20 minutes to finish and the cpu maxed out at around 70°c. There are people who have experienced system shutdowns because of high cpu temperatures. If you have such concerns, you can always edit your power plan or disable turbo boost on amd systems. I highly recommend waiting for the shaders to fully build before doing anything.

For the display and graphics settings, a quick google search for ""the last of us pc optimal settings"" will give you many websites with detailed explanations on what each setting does. For this test I have used the guide from a website called exputer and made some small tweaks. Some settings have little impact on the visuals but a big impact on the performance. With these settings the visuals look great and the performance is optimal as well.

In the first two hours of gameplay the game ran on average at around 80 fps with dlss balanced and vsync off. I haven't experienced major stutters or graphical glitches. The average total hardware utilisations were around:

- cpu 60%
- vram 8gb
- ram 16gb

However, not all scenes are the same. Some are lighter to run and some are heavier to run. I would consider the overall experience to be smooth and playable.

-----------------

If you happen to have the exact specs and drivers as I have, then I do recommend getting this game only on a sale. Although not guaranteed, you likely should not experience major problems.

Even though I had a great experience with the game performance, that does not make any other recent complaints invalid. Some systems are still clearly having problems, regardless of whether they have the recommended specs or not. This is certainly not their fault, but rather the game's fault. I absolutely do not recommend buying the game without checking whether you have any known issues with your hardware. With all things taken into consideration, I would not recommend this game to most people due to performance issues.

-----------------

Edit: After finishing the main game, here is some additional information about the performance.   

- Overall it was a smooth experience, however towards the end of the game there were sections where the frame rate dropped to low 40s and one section where the frame rate was in the low 30s. Other sections were smooth as mentioned before.
- There was one time in the early game where the game froze up and resulted in me having to restart the game.

Other than that I haven't experienced any new major issues."

I'll be honest I purchased hoping it would be like a ""Days Gone 2"" as that was an excellent game. I recommend buying ""Days Gone"" instead, this game is trash. I'm going to try and get a refund... but the game took so long just to compile the shaders even on a high end system, I think I've probably missed my refund window after I tried to give it a fair shot at game play.

The story is as old as time, post apocalypse, remnants of government keeping the population in check, outside the safe zone is bad, the best retelling of this story I can think of is Half-life 2, this is not a good retelling so far. Dull.

Also, be aware that every time you update your graphics driver (usually once a month if you have an Nvidia graphics card) you will have to rebuild the game shaders. This will also happen if you verify your install files. So keep that in mind before you do the (entirely reasonable) thing and click ""verify"" after a crash and/or heavy graphical glitching. Set aside an hour or more for that process to complete. 

At this rate, the PC port should be a recommended purchase (5 out of 5 for gameplay and non-glitching graphics) sometime in late 2024. Maybe early 2025. Pretty sure.

My first set of crashes I had to go into my BIOS and disable resize bar and my second set I had to re-enable it. If you have to go into BIOS just for the game to play through a certain section of the game just for it to make you re-enable said thing in BIOS then the game is no where near optimized/bug free.

The game runs OK at most in 1440p all ultra but it does dip to the 30 - 40s in transitions from cutscene to gameplay and when you go into the upgrade workbench. However this isn't as much of a problem as the crashes that occur.

As a man with a big penis (15 inches), i have sex with lots of women with big boobs and butt all the time. girls love my big penis because it was very big big and they love having sex with my penis. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. i think the developers should add girls into this game so it can be the last of us and sexy girls. they could add it to part 3 and i think this would do more numbers than the original game. all my girlfriends say im very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. one of my girlfriends asked me to have sex with her but i told her i was playing a sex game instead so she started crying and became a lesbian and killed herself because i did not have sex with her. i have sex with women. not men. i am not gay. i am very cool and handsome so girls always have sex with me because i am very cool and sexy. my penis is very big. since i have a big penis, i get too many girls wanting to have sex with me. sometimes, i just want to have sex with myself (hand sex) while playing the last of us part 1. how can i have sex with myself if there are no girls in the last of us part 1 ? i don't think this is right and the developers should do something about this because my penis (15 inches) can't take it anymore. And i have no clue how people get girls that are nude in this game, i seen people post pics of their girl characters nude in the community section but none of them have explained how they did it and the game itself does not explain it either so therefore i assume its done with mods of some kind cus you cant play the game with girls. i feel like you lied to me so I'm not going to play this game anymore and am giving you a thumbs down."

 The games implementation of DLSS has a weird blurring issue whenever you are moving your character; the blur is not present if you are standing still. It can look like the game its running at 720p (even on Quality DLSS at 3440-1440p) when you are walking, which is quite distracting. There are also certain rooms and environments where the lighting is glitchy, resulting in your character being lit up in a dark room.

I am sure they will keep updating, but it is not worth full price after this release. Wait until its $30 or lower, as it is a technically deficient port. Shame as the game itself is a genuine classic and the developers/artists who made it deserve better shepherding of their exceptional work.

pro:
1) looks great, even on lowest settings.
2) PC requirements on steam about storage are wrong: the game is only 78GB, which is nice.
3) I could not care less, but most other people really like the story.

con:
1) runs like ass. on a ryzen 3600x cpu with 16GB ram, radeon 6800xt with 16GB vram, on an ssd, vsync off, on lowest settings at 2000x1000 px resolution (downscaled from 1440p, no FSR): 60-80fps. (on high settings, full res 1440p, 40-70fps). does not sound too bad, but in either scenarios the game stutters like absolute hell. multiple times per second, always (AFTER shaders have been precompiled in the main menu, which btw took about 5-10 mintues on this PC). capping the framerate at 30 or 60 does not help, neither does enabling vsync.
2) has a weird bug in linux where the vram is wrongly detected as 4GB, even though my gpu has 16. can be fixed though by launching the game with WINEDLLOVERRIDES=""amd_ags_x64.dll=b"" %command% . (this has no influence on performance, incl. stutters)

conclusion: not recommended. this is a cinematic game, even 30fps would be fine (for me), but it needs to be stable. the stuttering means you cannot enjoy the visuals or cinematics because the image jerks around, which also would make combat suck if you stick around that long, which arguably is the whole point of this game. absolute tragedy."

I'm playing on an RX 6750xt (12GB of VRAM), core i7-4790 (still a great CPU), 16GB RAM, and getting about 51 FPS avg. I've updated drivers repeatedly, but still at random intervals, the game just crashes. It's very frustrating to experience and really kills my desire to keep playing. Especially since it's a 10+ year old game that I've played many many times before. It just doesn't seem worth it to deal with the bugs, to see a better version of everything I've already experienced. I might try changing the install to be on an SSD, before I completely give up. I hope this helps you make your decision to purchase or not."

1116,3,0.3769,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","The Last of Us is one of the closest things gamers will get to a perfect game... but it deserved way better treatment than this.

My review here is mostly gonna focus on performance, which I rarely do considering the fact that I like to focus on the game itself most of the time when I review something. But this port definitely warrants it, because this game deserved better. All I will say is that this is The Last of Us and its companion story DLC Left Behind in their entirety on PC. The combat, story and level design are amazing and in my opinion live up to the hype.

Getting into why I'm actually writing this review, I do want to say that my playthrough with TLOU on PC was not nearly as bad as I saw near launch. I didn't encounter any major visual glitches and only had 1 crash during my playthrough. 60-65% of the time, the game ran in 60 FPS. 

However, this game still runs like dookie. My CPU and RAM were idling most of the time at 80% usage and my CPU was at 100% for massive amounts of time. My GPU was handling the game fine, especially with DLSS, but was still at 81% usage even with DLSS on. While I mentioned earlier that 60-65% the game would run in 60 FPS, that's still nearly half of my time playing this game with major FPS dips and stuttering. 

In addition to these performance issues, the shader cache building and rebuilding is still a problem. Granted, these shaders are not taking nearly as long they were at launch. But I'd hardly call a game optimized for PC if the game needs a shader rebuild every time I update my GPU drivers.

The whole point of why I'm writing this review is that we are getting progressively worse ports from Naughty Dog and by extension Sony. Uncharted 4, while not being the most optimized and having the same issue of building/rebuilding shaders, ran way better than TLOU when I played it at launch. 

I see a lot of positive reviews beginning to pop up on here and while I'm happy that people are finally able to play the game, I don't want to communicate to Iron Galaxy and Naughty Dog that they can slap Steam Deck verified on this port and call it a day. This was a rushed out port to try and capitalize on the HBO series' success, and it still shows even after the multiple updates this game has received. Further work needs to be done to optimize this game, and until that is done the PS5 version or the original/remastered version on PS4 are still the superior ways to play this game. 

TL;DR

While the game is certainly playable, it's still not fully fixed. I'm going to revisit the game around Halloween after (hopefully) a few more updates and change my review if I see significant improvement. Overall, if you're looking for a smooth action adventure/ survival horror experience on PC, go play the Dead space remake or RE 4 remake. Otherwise, I would wait a bit longer or play the game on PS5.

The Last of Us™ Part I is an AMAZING game with a story that is unrivalled even to this date no game has EVER been as good as The Last of Us. I played the game day 1 and it blew my mind. I played the game in 2023 Remastered and it blew my mind. I watched HBO's Last of Us show and it BLEW MY MIND... the The Last of Us will NEVER be forgotten... that is how good this game is. Watching Joel and Ellie's bond getting stronger as the game goes on. Watching Joel teach Ellie how to shoot and play the guitar is father of the year material. Watching Joel put his own life on the line for Ellie.... its truly beautiful. The stealth is a 10/10. Story a 10/10. Music 10/10. Characters 10/10. Combat 10/10. EVERYTHING Last of Us 10/10. 

[h1][b] PC PORT ISSUES [/b][/h1]
Now, I would 100% recommend this game to ANYONE and EVERYONE but... the PC port is an absolute mess. I have played for 10 hours and let me list the issues for you:
⚫I have crashed 15 times so far and I am about half way through the game.
⚫I have CONSTANT FPS drops and stuttering. FPS cannot stay above 40 at times and the stuttering is constant the entire time.
(PC SPECS ARE LISTED ON MY STEAM ACCOUNT)
⚫My game occasionally freeze's here and there which results, sometimes, in a crash which makes me loose about 10 minutes of progress (playing on the hardest difficulty).
⚫Shader loading times are longer than CoD shader loading times.... wow....

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]
I am truly heartbroken that the PC port is broken. If it did not have this many issues I would recommend the PC port version of it but if you have a PS4/PS5... just go play it there.

[h1][b] The Last of Us Part 1 PC PORT - Terrible. Not worth £50 for an unfinished broken mess of a port [/b][/h1]"

Now I've actually completed the game because it is in what I would call a ""playable"" state. That being said, I wouldn't recommend it quite yet. There is still very frequent stuttering during gameplay and cutscenes throughout the entire game. There are a handful of areas that seem to have bugged performance overall, not tied to the capability of the hardware. There were occasional occurrences of the screen flicking to white, both entirely and parts of the image. Areas with lots of water are the most problematic in the game. There are some bugs with the companion AI, sometimes they just stop following you for a while. There are occasional moments of the camera going through a wall and the world disappearing, some moments where animations don't line up correctly, and some moments of music errors. 

It's playable, it generally runs well when not encountering stutter or water issues, and it's a very good looking game. It's come a long way from launch, but there's still a ways to go."

Somehow this game got worse over time for me. I am not speaking of the gameplay or the story but of the ""optimization"" Updates.
I preordered TLOU 1 and when I first started it at the release date everything went fine. I had a near bugfree experience and it was just a bet nervewrecking to wait for the Shaders to build after every update.
But then, after another update the game dind't run smoothly anymore. I lowered the graphics setting to the minimum but it still didn't get more than 5-8 fps.
This was around one and a half months ago.
3 Days ago I thought i could jump back in again and look, wether or not it got fixed. So I tried to update the game, but Steam said i dont have enough space left on my disk (I have around 200 GB left). This issue didn't stop to accure so I reinstalled the Game entirely (I have shitty internet so it took a night to download).
Today i started the game and the Shaders started to build. There was just one difference to the older shader building proccess. This time it overloaded my CPU which led to my PC restarting itself. I tried it a second time afterwards but my PC crashed again.
I find it funny that I had no issues with the game at its release but after all the updates it got unplayable.
Probably won't touch it again, sadly."

Its not recommended because its 4.5/10

The game is not bad but i wouldn't say the best game as some people hype. My friends gonna hate me for this but here we go.

[b]Important note: [/b]i have never played or watched anything related to last of us previously, it may sound impossible given the game was quite popular, i stayed away to any content hoping one day i would play the game myself. And i played the game on pc. Finished it couple minutes ago. Havent played the extra scenario, not planning to.

================
[b]Visuals:[/b] graphics are amazing if you have a beast. I have 3080 rtx with i7-12700H (Laptop) thinking it would be enough, but in the lowest settings i got -60 fps most of the time(from 30-140). And yes, fans are maxed, laptop is in performance mode.

[b]Gameplay: [/b]sometimes annoying, as i played with the controller, with the weapon sway it is nearly impossible to shoot enemies.

[b]World: [/b] Because the storyline is linear, we have to follow a specific path literally. Idk how to explain it properly but I'm just running in an empty street then get to the next checkpoint, killing some guys following another path, and do it again. The models and props are good, with lots of variety but as we can't interact with anything there wasn't any reason for me to check out the surroundings.

[b]Plot: [/b]Oh boy. Let me be honest, It's not the best story, good one yes, but not the best. There are lots of time skipping and it's just random, with no information on what happened in the meantime. It's like, now we are at a dangerous place we just fought against a horde of enemies, boom, next scene *sometime later*  now we are at completely irrelevant place. don't know what happened, how we survived like its just LAZY WRITING. I understand nothing important happened but still its weird. And i didn't get surprised by any scene, most of the story felt like a cliche.

[b]Characters: [/b]They come, they say something, then they die after some scenes. All of them! Only the 2 protagonist Joel and Ellie survives. And every single character is so bloodthirsty like come on, there is only 10% population left and people kill everyone they see, even if they are not threats.

My opinion on the ending: [spoiler] Ok, even if fireflies were unethical, if the surgery was gonna cure the world, not sure if the plan was real or not, Joel acted like a total dumbass, selfish person[/spoiler]"

Another update arrived... had to wait for about an hour to load shaders. The game seemed to be in a better state, but waiting for shaders to load for such a long time was definitely annoying.
Wanted to continue playing the game rn, but guess what, SHADERS  were loading from 1% again...

Besides that, story is all right, remake is visually more appealing than the original, but it is pretty much the same game, and that is not fine when releasing a story that's 10 years old!

DON'T BUY IT FOR THE FULL PRICE, the devs disrespected players with the poor condition the game was released in, and they don't deserve your money.

BUY IT WHEN IT'S CHEAP, as they treated us the same way."

I was hoping after a few months of it being released that I wouldn't have problems, especially since I have a good pc, but there have been constant awful ones. It's very hard to stay engaged or interested in the game play when there are constant flashing colors, rainbow particles covering the entire screen, cut scenes looking foggy, or being able to see pixel windows through walls. I've spent a lot of this game rushing so I can get out of the area with flashing lights and eye strain. Even after a huge patch update, the bugs I have are the exact same, and if anything, they got worse. I've been a fan of this game for years, but this is the worst port I've ever seen.

I upgraded from a msi 2080ti xtrio (6k points in superposition 8k - 3070ti does 6500 points overclocked) to a 4070ti tuf oc (7k points in superposition 8k) with the same cpu a 9900k 5.1ghz hyperthreading on and 1.380v) and pc rebooted, just rebooted after a few minutes. I'm upgrading to a 5800x3D and new mobo because I want that cpu. 

My initial thoughts for now is that in 2013 I watched Last of Us 1 on a iphone 4s from 1080p dude, forgot his name now, and it changed my life - I recall crying while rewatching the suicide scene on pc and big screen, I was really shaken up. I waited since 2013 for a pc port and this is it? What type of Godly cpu do u need to get this game to work? 

I'll revisit this review but I can't run the game atm - not sure perhaps default mobo settings and cpu overclock. I'm sad that they did this to this amazing game for overpowered graphic fidelity. 

I own Last of Us 1 Deluxe edition. I bought to support the 2013 release version, not this badly ported overpowered nonsense. Good luck getting it running. If you do, it will be life changing I'm sure."

1250,3,0.3977,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","Two Part Review: Game Performance & Game Play

GAME PERFORMANCE: 
I had read the reviews and I was aware that the game was bugged pretty badly when it was first released for PC, but I was hoping that all bugs would be fixed by now; they are not! The game had graphics issues where in the cinematic scenes the characters hair would look like melted plastic strips, and Joel's facial hair would look like splashed on road tar. During the game itself, there was some shading and shadow flickering going on. Also, the scopes for the weapons where blacked out inside so that you could not view anything through them, thus rendering them unusable; I even had a game crash to deal with. I am using top of the line gaming hardware that has played every other modern day title without issue. 

GAME PLAY:
As far as the game itself, I expected far better considering all the hype associated with this game and the fact that this is one of Sony's franchise games. The game was extremely linear with a very small world. I was really shocked by the lack of content in this game for the price; even the added DLC felt like nothing more than a short collection of cut scenes. I completed the main story in about 21 hours which is far less than I have gotten out of the other big title games. Although I enjoyed the ending and found myself bonding with the character Ellie as the game progressed, the story itself is just not that inspirational or deep; just a simple case of we have to get there from here. I guess my mistake was playing Days Gone right before I played this, which is a far superior post-apocalyptic zombie type game when compared to The Last of Us.

The one thing I will give the developers props for is their attention to detail. The abandoned homes and buildings looked like real living and working environments instead of just some half empty shells with a few pieces of basic furniture thrown in like some developers take shortcuts with."

Starting off of my nearly two hours of playtime, 40 mins was spent pre-compiling shaders. Playing this game on a m.2 is a must and it is still unacceptable. The changing of scenes and opening doors to sequences will go from the 80fps to single digit numbers. The 80 fps isnt even accurate to be honest, it ranges from 1-80 fps and completly inconsistant. I have it on All medium settings and eats up 8gb of vram. The constant variations in fps honestly gave me motion sickness and the framerate should be caped. The beginning section where their is a blockade of cars near the hospital hit 17 fps for me and was common to see fps in the single digits. I have no clue how people who have a 1650 for example is playing this game to where its ""acceptable"". DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID AND TRUST THE POSITIVE REVIEWS.

WARNING
1.For every driver update your gpu has or update the game has. You need to pre-compile shaders all over again. (Friend told me that)

2. Spend your hard earned money on a game that values your time and this does not. I spent $50 on this game and I feel like I've been robbed. Hell, even If I got this game for free, I would feel robbed. Honestly, they have to pay me money to do a full playthrough on this trash

3.Combat is awful. The constant frame dips ruin combat, which can make you miss actions such as dodging attacks, and honestly every single time I fire a round of my gun, the frames drop signficantly.

Ellie looks so homely at times in this game that I feel apathy for her, and being eighties years old in a fourteen year olds body, does destroy the joy of Ellie's character from the original.  Ellie's cuteness in the original made it a great joy to hear her say curse words and beat up Bill with a lead pipe.  Here that is completely undone by her ""let's make her look like Ellie from The Last Of Us part two (b.s. game by the way)""  because in a lot of the game I find her uuuuuuugggggggggggllllllyyyyyyyyyyy.  Fifthly dialog from the first game has been removed or replaced with different dialog.  I need to play through more to find if those dialogues are triggered differently in this version.  Sixth,  You can no longer mutilate the doctor at the end of the Hospital stage.  Apparently I am not the only one whom enjoyed dismembering the surgeon, after playing the Last Of Us part two,  and saying, ""Here Abby, mourn this.""  No blowing off the doctors head, and both feet after killing him.  No sticking every arrow you've got on you into his dead form.  Shame I really enjoy killing that motherfucker at the end, thanks to Abby and that awful sequel.  Lastly today I go load the game and there is no sync with the Steam cloud so I cannot load my previous saved game. or any game for that matter.  Way to go Steam and Naughty Dog,  but then again dogs will poop any where so no surprise there.  Overall this game could be much improved if Naughty dog finds somebody that knows what they are doing when it comes to pc games.  Iron Galaxies not a fan."

This game, to put it mildly, is a complete disappointment in terms of its performance on my setup – even when forced to operate under the lowest possible settings. Despite employing a 9700k & 4070Ti configuration – a setup that just flawlessly ran Miles Morales at max settings, hitting a solid 120fps with DLS Quality – this game still sputters, stumbles, and strains, pushing my CPU to its absolute limit. Texture loading is erratic, audio sporadically crackles, and those pervasive, pesky stutters? They're still there, regardless of how long I allow everything to compile prior to play. In no uncertain terms, I can't recommend this. Do not buy this.

Original Review

I'm absolutely gutted to write this, but wow, the PC version of The Last of Us is a letdown of epic proportions. It's so sub-par in its optimisation that it's bordering on absurd. I braved the storm of negative reviews at launch and decided to give it a whirl. But man, what an unplayable mess it turned out to be.

We're talking about textures that refuse to load, stuttering visuals, and audio that crackles like a bonfire. I was really looking forward to experiencing this game; all I'd heard were glowing reviews. But I sure didn't want my first impression to be tarnished by a shoddy PC port like this.

My advice? Hold off on buying this for at least half a year, or even better, a full year. It's a sad joke, and I genuinely hope PlayStation rethinks its decision to work with Iron Galaxy. Seriously, give Nixxes a call next time, will ya? Thanks."

Gameplay: overall pretty good, if illogical. If an enemy drops a loaded firearm, could Joel or Ellie pick it up and use it? This game's answer, maybe 10% of the time, the rest of the time, literally random ammo will drop, or nothing will drop, and the enemy's weapon turns into part of the scenery. This is a personal pet peeve of mine for games, and to be fair, there is usually adequate ammo if you do mostly stealth kills(free version, no shiv version).  Aiming with mouse and keyboard is easy, I assume console controller people had a much harder time with this game, all you have to do is hit headshots on even the toughest enemy, of which there are few.   Scavenging, crafting, are all pretty good for 2013, other games have surpassed this by now, but you have to realize the timeframe difference.

Story, overall, really good, right up until the end. At that point, the makers decided they want to be directors, not game makers (good job on the show by the way, up until the same scene at the end).  In a better GAME (not show, or movie) there would have been a choice at the end. Does Joel A) Believe the Fireflies and try to save humanitry? or B) Seflishly and illogically and emotionally childishly prevent the possibly LAST DOCTORS ON EARTH from taking what they need from one person to save literally the entire human race?

Of course, the player can only allow Joel to do what the directors wanted. You cannot choose option B, literally you have no choice. You cannot walk away, you cannot make Joel kill himself, you are railroaded into the foolish emotional choice that I hope leads to the death of the human race in The Last of Us Part 2, that or Part 2 ends with Ellie finally getting her fucking skull sawed open.

If you can tolerate a railroaded, illogical, fake binary choice ending, then this game may be for you.

The game has been patched up admirably as of this writing, and runs well, and looks great. I beat the main story in apparently 28 hours, but there was definitely some random walking around and searching for resources and story notes in there, this game can probably be completed in 10-12 hours if you truly hustle.

I realize it's just a video game(and now a show, of course) but this kind of selfish, illogical thinking being continually praised is literally bad for the human race, in real life.  Of course it's a Trolley Problem in game format, but most people don't realize the point of the Trolley Problem is to point out how ludicrous reducing a situation to one of two outcomes really is.  If you must be railroaded at the end, then AT LEAST do the video game option of letting the player ACTUALLY CHOOSE THE OUTCOME.   Shout out to the ""Should have let Ellie Die"" crew, all dozen of us. :)

Now I need to go make a mod that allows Joel to just walk away at the end, and let Ellie die.

Anyway, a friend of mine owned this game so I had the opportunity to try out barely enough to see that it legitimately does not work.
I might be on the most entry-level gaming laptop out there (GTX 1650Ti 4GB, Ryzen 7 4800H), but I can play games like Dead Space Remake, Battlefield V, Control, Mafia: Definitive Edition, Modern Warfare 2 (the new one), all RE Engine Resident Evil games, Far Cry 6 and so on without too much of a hitch. This pile of garbage can barely run on 720p FSR Performance Lowest Settings. 

I would've rather had them release this game on PC back in 2014 with the Remaster instead of having us wait for this... *thing*. Atleast even if that port was garbage, PCs/gaming laptops will get so good that they would be running it perfectly fine, now (look at GTA IV).

And if they haven't had enough fuel to the fire, remember how I said I managed to play because my friend owned the game? Yeah, they had the *nerve* to disable Family Sharing, so I can't play anymore.
Why? It's not a multiplayer game (they removed Factions), it's all singleplayer and there's no other reason to disable family sharing other than to piss more people off, or to expect people to buy into it and get scammed by the poor performance of the port. Dead Space Remake doesn't do this, so why? There's so many examples of good choices in this industry, literally just look left and right, fellas. Look. Left. And. Right.

My Steam account is as old as Steam itself downloaded as DRM that came with Half-Life 2 CD back in 2004.

When the news was out that it was coming out on PC, I was eagerly waiting for its release but was disappointed when I saw all the negative reviews on performance, bugs and crashes.  I waited for a few patches, took the risk and bought it after the release of the 1.0.5 patch.

Frame rate varies between 80-105 on the highest settings in 4K. Shaders took exactly 7 min in initial loading. The only 1 bug I encountered was when a brief cut scene started looping and restarting the last checkpoint fixed it. 

 As for the game itself, despite somewhat outdated gameplay (aged like fine wine) it still is one of the best video games that exists.

Thus, the only thing left in this game is unnecessary violence --- senseless violence, how violent is it? Only two significant roles, besides JO and Ellie, are spared in this game. 

 The game causes severe motion sickness. The gameplay is also quite dull and repetitive: wiping out all enemies in a stage and then moving to the next one that resembles others. This game has no combat freedom; everything is highly deliberated, including routes, weapons, ammunition, and status(forced injurious and captures). So, you can ""choose"" only from one of the solutions/approaches prepared by devs to play through. 

It's frustrating that I was misguided by the hype; after all, Sony is a company that can afford it. But it indeed deteriorates its original reputation."

20230616, 1.1.0:
seems to be fixed. so if that means, they clearly fixed their game, i can recommend buying this game NOW on this patch level. can someone else confirm this on other pc systems as well?

From my point of view they should not have released this game port below this patch level.

slightly improved, but suddenly game crashes are still in this pc game port. Reoccuring game crashes after about 2h game time. With this kind of technical software issues i still can not recommend buying it.

as far as i played the game yet on this new patch (~1h), the previous described game freeze/crash did not occur anymore. my pc: 16gb ram, 12gb video-ram (amd graphic card, latest drivers).
ram usage: ~12gb, max ram usage: 14gb

so far i can not recommend buying this game with this kind of technical software issues.
i purchased game within a amd graphic card bundle.

look closely on the ram usage at patch version 1.0.5.
ram usage is continuously increasing over game running time.
on my pc, 16gb ram & 12gb video-ram, the game-app freeze/crash after 30-45 min.
still a serious memory leak problem in this game port.
this memory leak problem causes 3 game freeze/crash in less them 2h gaming time on my pc.

I'm sure that The Last of Us was great on Playstation. I wish I could have experienced it like that, but I'm not about to buy a PS3 just to play it. The story is great and I wish I could enjoy it. The experience on PC, however, is abysmal.

I could write a whole essay on the graphical bugs alone. Textures clipping, turning black, the scope being blocked so you can't use it, character's hair turning into weird squares, the list goes on and on. And these aren't one-off issues, they are constant. I was experiencing two or three visual bugs at a time throughout every play session.

Then there are the gameplay bugs. Characters will get stuck on objects, stuck on nothing, decide to not move objects that they are supposed to move, and more! Enemies will take cover behind absolutely nothing at all. Sometimes they track you through walls like Superman, and other times they roleplay as Hellen Keller, ignoring you as you take down their friends right in front of their faces.

Sometimes the game will crash during a shootout. Sometimes it crashes during exploration. Sometimes it crashes on startup. Very rarely, the game doesn't crash at all.

You can shoot your gun by clicking on menu options, which is an interesting design choice. As is the fact that Joel seems intent on pulling out the molotov at every opportunity. Craft an item? Molotov! Throw a brick? Molotov! Out of ammo? Molotov! He sure does love arson.

Also, the game runs like I'm trying to run Crysis on a PSP, but I'm trying to run a remake of a ten year old game on a modern mid-end system, ON LOW SETTINGS.

This is unacceptable. Do not play this game, do not let anyone you care about play this game. Shame on you, Naughty Dog.

1497,3,0.4413,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","While I haven't experienced some of the problems others have mentioned, there is something to be said about the games optimisation.

For reference I'm playing this on an I5 12600K and an RTX 4080. I get an average of about 80-90fps with DLSS off at 1440p, which isn't bad compared to some of the other reviews I've seen on here.

But think about that in the context of other demanding or recent games - I can get nearly 200FPS in returnal with Raytracing on using DLSS and Frame Generation, and 130-140 with Frame Generation off. I can get 150FPS in Cyberpunk (fuggin' Cyberpunk!) with all Raytracing besides path-tracing and with DLSS and FG on.

In Last of Us Part 1, DLSS actually [i]makes the framerate worse[/i], dragging it down to 70-80fps.

On the bright side if you're on team red and have a 7900XTX your experience will be exactly the same, getting about 80-90fps with FSR on - but when you consider there's no raytracing in this game, on paper the XTX should be outpacing the 4080 with rasterization and it really doesn't, at least not in my experience testing between the two GPU's.

It's a shame because the games reputation for being a modern great is well deserved, but they fumbled this port hard. You might shudder when you see Iron Galaxy (notorious for the crappy Arkham Knight PC port) helped port the game to PC but various sources around the internet are saying their involvement was minimal, and the vast majority of the port work was handled by Naughty Dog themselves.

For me personally, I don't care who's to blame, I just want them to fix the damn thing. If you're reading this wondering whether to pick the game up: wishlist it and keep an eye on patches and updates. If you've got a 4080 or a 7900XT/XTX and are happy to lock the framerate to 60 you'll be happy. If you're running something older or with less power, or are wanting to push your rig to try and throw out 120fps+, cross your fingers they are going to do something about it and come back later."

I am going to do a negative review as the price is just too steep for what you get. 

The performance was not too bad i usually ended up 100ish FPS on my 4080 build.

I have just completed the story and i must say i am left disappointed from what i was expecting, i am confident this game is overrated.  really enjoyed Ellie and Joel's relationship but i just could not form the same connection as i have with other games, the ending seemed to leave me wondering if that's all (i do understand there is a part 2)

The game was absolutely beautiful and there is no argument that it was one of the best looking games i have played. 

In conclusion, very beautiful game, semi-interesting story but for $60+ it's just too much (19 hours)."

Changing settings from low to medium only make it worse. Sure, the game looks better. It isn't worth the trade off for a MASSIVE hit to performance. This game should not have been released in it's current state and honestly should be a crime for $70.

story has a nihilistic, middle school edgelord view on humanity and what people do during times of crisis. its focus on individualism and self righteousness actively hinders anything remotely interesting it has to say. 
characters are one dimensional, cliche, and have actions/goals that make little to no sense in the context of their situations. their dialogue is also cringe inducing. take a shot every time someone says ""patched up"" or something stupid like that.

But unless you have a high end Nvidia GPU (or a very high end AMD one that won't have to rely on the subpar FSR2 implementation), the PS5 will provide a better experience. If you are at all interested, wait, wait for a sale at the earliest. The only reason why this is in my library is because I got it for literally free with my PC, it was cheaper than picking up an old PS4 to play the original remaster.

From my first hour, I had no VRAM issues, but you should expect that from having a 16gb card. I did have CPU performance issues that meant that I couldn't have a smooth experience above 60fps, and I wouldn't be surprised if I could get drops under that in more data streaming intensive areas. What was even more shocking was the lengthy loading times, like I decided to restart the game after several minutes of no progress on a fucking PCIe SSD. Even had a few graphical glitches, nothing a settings tweak or two didn't revert, but I literally just started the game and had them.

So seriously, I have had good luck with this version, and still had issues. Please exercise some goddamn patience and wait before burning your parents money on this. We shouldn't be supporting companies for rushing and crunching their devs to a pulp, then continuing to do so post launch under the stress of the public eye. I can understand that alot of the issues come from just it being a PS5 title, itl naturally be hard to run and hungry on memory and resources. But many signs show it just being rushed onto PC, like the file formats being designed for PS5 and harder to decompress on PC. So more importantly of all, give the fucking devs some time to fix this instead of complaining they didn't radically fix all the issues in one patch. Because of upper management bullocks, they now have to work under the ire of the public. I hope that one day I can delete this review and replace it with a positive one."

I UNDERCLOCKED my i9-13900K (stock it should be able to boost to 5.8 on P-core with sufficient cooling but LOL GOOD LUCK) I had it overclocked from 5.5 static (just what it would reach with my cooling solution; liquid AIO) to 5.8 static on cores 0-3 (boosting to 5.8 in heavier loads), and 5.7 on cores 4-7, boosting to 5.8 in heavier loads. E-cores I left at 4.3Ghz since they are mostly meant fore background tasks on the desktop and don't affect games that don't utilize more than 8 cores. Also to keep the processor a little cooler :P But I had to revert back to complete stock/safe core values of 5.5 on cores 0-7 and no voltage offset and the game finally works. I also had my RTX 4070TI overclocked slightly but had to axe that aswell, AND my intel XMP memory overclock in the bios had to go as well. The game looks beautiful, apart from TAA you can't turn off (when you move it slightly blurs stuff) There's a few shadow and effects settings you can tune with almost no noticeable difference in picture quality to help improve stability and performance. That being said, there is a constant fps dip every few second of around 7-10 fps for some reason, and when it dips to around 60 fps, it is NOTICEABLY choppy. Granted, I'm playing it with almost everything maxed out and raytracing pretty much maxed as well and I get and average of around 75 fps. It goes up to and maintains 100+ fps indoors but outside it's kinda all over the place; anywhere from 65-95 fps. It's pretty rough. And I'm definitely not picky when I say that 100+ fps gameplay is OBJECTIVELY BETTER THAN 60 locked. Aiming is easier, it's more pleasant to look at, it feels more responsive; especially on mouse and keyboard.

Not to mention the FPS ranged from below average to staggeringly low, the shaders took at least an hour to load (when the game crashed/got updated I had to reload them!), and the environment textures were still sometimes buggy and weird. Very frustrating. It was definitely improved after the update but still, I've no clue why any testers would think ""Hm yes, this works well enough to satisfy our players"". A bad port of a great game.
 
The positives:
Cutscenes looked incredible. When they had loaded properly, the environments were very detailed and immersive - beautiful or disturbing depending on where you are. 
Looking at the remnants of people's homes and lives, piecing together their stories and reading about all of the premature deaths and desperate measures the people may have had to take to try and survive in the artifact notes was suitably haunting.
The initial outbreak/plane crash/you-know-what sequence is still as scary and devastating as ever... well, as is the rest of the game.
Excellent, complex cast of characters you can't help but empathise with and root for despite their flaws (most of them, anyway), and when the gameplay itself is uninterrupted by crashes it's very enjoyable. Audio is perfect, no complaints.

I'm unsure whether to say I recommend it or not because I do love all the story aspects of the game and I'm so pleased I finally got to play it, it's just disappointing it's in such a state.

If you have money and patience to spare, or NASA has cleared you to borrow one of their old computers then sure, buy it, but otherwise i'd recommend waiting until the issues get fixed because currently you will likely be disappointed and frustrated."

A really big disappointment on PC.

Despite the gameplay showing its age, the story is incredibly cinematic as it unfolds from gameplay to cutscenes. This version is also a rollercoaster ride of emotions, but not in the same way as the console version. The annoyances of the amount of loading encountered go from mildly inconvenient to frustrating which ultimately turns this masterpiece into an incredibly disheartening experience (but not because of the story). Sound crackling issues, cutscene audio desyncing and black screens (seemingly infinite loading without indicators?) are other remaining problems.

Hopefully this version gets properly fixed in the future, preferably before we really become The Last of Us (to experience this game)."

Following a number of patches since my last review the game is in a much more playable state and I am seeing hardly any graphical glitches. FINALLY!!!!
Game stability and frame rate seems a lot better too but shader compilation still takes an age on my RTX2070. 

If you were holding off on buying the game because of all the issues then I would say that now is a good time to buy it.


====ORIGINAL REVIEW=====
Abysmal is the only word to describe this port.

Played this title on the PS3 and PS4 and absolutely loved it and was really looking forward to playing it again on the PC but dear god it is awful.

I cannot get a consistent frame rate at all.

Sometimes the graphics look good but then other times it seems that some rendering has broken and things like hair look like clay.

vSync seems to decide to turn itself off even though it is set to 'on' in the settings.

The list of issue goes on and this is after the latest patch which required another two hour shader recompilation.

All involved in this port should hang their heads in shame."

1642,3,0.4126,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","So this game in its original form has been around for a while now. I remember when I was first introduced to it, thinking “this one seems right up my ally”. A post apocalyptic game in modern U.S settings? Sign me up! Alas, it was a PS exclusive. I’ve been part of the PC gaming master race for most of my life, and I’m not as young as I used to be. Last time I had a console, it was a PS2, back in the day. But the PC has always been my platform. Ever since the glory days of the CGI. The variety of games was second to none, and besides, aiming with a controller seemed to be an impossible feat. Not to talk about first person shooters. 

So, every couple of years, when I could rarely afford it, I bought a flashy new gaming PC. Those grand PS exclusives kept on coming out respectively, but good news - a decent chunk of them were starting to port to the PC as well! 
Some of these ports were really good. I enjoyed them. Games like God of War, Days Gone, even Horizon Zero Dawn, eventually. However, a lot of those releases - in the modern tradition of broken ports and games releases overall - were not. Basically, you paid a lot of money for a broken product.   

Then, finally, The Last of US came out to PC. Unfortunately, and not very surprisingly, It was also one big mess of a release. I read carefully the reviews describing various crashes and performance issues, and the oh very famous “wait for a patch” punchline. So I did. I’ve waited for it to be patched. I’m a veteran PC gamer, after all. I know the drill. Then, after a patch or two, I bought it. Knowing that there’s a considerable chance I might regret it. And I did. Hogwarts Legacy, The Last of Us, and now also Jedi: Survivor. What is the point of investing so much money in a lean mean gaming machine, if it won’t run any of these games. Poor ports and optimizations, be the reason as it may - enough is enough. 

So I bought a PS5. The console itself was cheaper than just my GPU, in my mean gaming machine. Aiming with a controller is still a pain, but the best part is, I know that now I can play all of these games without worrying about throwing money into the bin. Without purchasing another shady port, only to sit up all night in forums, fiddling with the settings and try to optimise that piece of garbage on my own. You don’t need a 4,000$ worth of rig, just to play Stardew Valley."

Sums up the experience pretty well..  
This is what the pinnacle of pc gaming looks like nowerdays. Whomever came up with this technical approach is either purposefully trolling the customers or a complete moron (and yes, i understand the technical aspects of what is going on, but this is a technical dead end). 
There are a lot of games that use this approach out there now, but TLOU has perfected this approach to the point where you will basically spend ALL of your logged time with the ""game"" precompiling shaders (of my 7h, i actually managed to play about 15min), in fact, the games title and description should be changed ""The last of precompiling shaders"" in order to not misleading potential buyers."

My setup: RTX 3080ti, AMD Ryzen 7 5800x, 32 GB of RAM and playing at 1440p.

Even though I have not come across any crashes yet, the performance is absolutely terrible, framerate drops from 110fps to 40fps in the first sections of the game and then it struggles to even get past 60fps later on on High settings, I also tried playing on Ultra and High and the GPU and CPU usage remains the same (GPU at 100% and CPU at 90%), also the performance is so unstable on both that I can't even tell which settings run better.

Performance aside, Naughty Dog, Sony and everybody involved in this should be ashamed of themselves, not only is this a terrible attempt at a PC Port, but this game was advertised as a next-gen Remake ""rebuilt from the ground up"" and it also fails miserably at that, in comparison, on Ultra settings this game looks nowhere near as good as other next gen games, take Resident Evil 4 Remake for example, which looks stunning and runs smoothly at 165fps at almost max settings, hell, even Horizon Zero Dawn looks and runs way better on PC, but playing this Last of Us ""Remake"" feels exactly like playing a PS4 game, textures, lights, animations, shadows, reflections, everything looks so outdated that its just laughable.

I wanted to like this thing.   After upgrading to a 40 series GPU I thought I'd give this thing one more try.  I only had 40 mins or so of play time, and most of that was shader compilation.   
Well anyhow, this game is in a better state than it was.   But not enough I'm afraid.  It is a very beautiful game, they have really done a great job with the visuals in this game.   And the gameplay, although it does feel a bit dated, it's not terrible.  Aside from the startup crashes, which still occur randomly for me at 50% of the time, other wise the game had been running ok.   In trying to shorten the shader pre-compliation times, they ended adding more stutter back into the game, and seemingly more instability.   After playing about 12 hours into this, enough time to get invested in the story, I was willing to look past the rough edges.   But after reaching a checkpoint in some watery tunnel, I am officially stuck, and can go no further.   As soon as I load into the game now, it starts me in an underwater cut scene, and as soon as I grab Ellie, it hard locks, every time.   I've tried moving back to previous state, etc..., and I cannot get past that point.   That was the breaking point for me.   I'm uninstalling this thing for the last time.   If this long after launch, they cannot fix the stability of this, well I'm just done.   My review still stands.   Stay far away from this train wreck.  For what it's worth here are my system specs.

By the time I got around to trying this turd,  I had already passed the 2 week mark, even though I only have 37 minutes of playtime, Steam wont refund this.   What a load of garbage.   As soon as this loads up, the characters look like some kind of abortion of ugly graphics that don't render properly, long shader build times, what can I say that hasn't already been said.   If you own a 30 series Nvidia card, don't even bother with this.   Either Iron Galaxy is so incompetent that they can't fix this, or they aren't willing too.

The game is not well optimised, even with low settings the game performs poorly. I am able to play other new games without these issues and my specs are in excess of the recommended requirements, yet running the game at high settings will max out the resources to an unacceptable level.

Also I don't understand why it needs to build shaders when first starting. I've never seen this on a normal PC game, only emulators. Why is this necessary on a modern PC game?

I did not enjoy the gameplay either. The gameplay is constantly interrupted by unskippable scripted events which take away control from the player, with occasional tedious quick time events. The first hour of the game is completely on-rails, with many forced walking segments and unskippable cutscenes. This makes repeat play throughs very long and boring.

The encounter sections are OK, however, often the game refuses to progress until all the enemies are killed, rather than give the player the choice to sneak or run past them.

The game is also very unbalanced on higher difficulties. Enemies may fail to drop ammo even if you DON'T HAVE ANY. The AI also cheats as they know your exact position without seeing where you went. Enemies will also randomly kill you when you punch/melee them even though you struck first.

I've also never managed to complete a full play through of the game without at least two crashes. I know other people who have experienced the same issue so it's not just me.

The story is OK I suppose, although if you're not invested in the story (I wasn't) then there's not really much for you here.

Good things to say, the checkpoints are fair for the most part. The speedrun timer is useful but you still have many unskippable cutscenes and scripted events which makes it an absolute slog to try and speedrun the game.

So why did I play it for over 100 hours? A friend wanted to race the game and told me the game was awesome. This turned out not to be the case. So I deliberately grinded the game to ensure that I would have a good chance of winning the race and taking vengeance for having to grind the game in the first place. I uninstalled it immediately after the race was over.

If you like the idea of this game and you're thinking of purchasing it, I would recommend getting Uncharted instead.

I played it first when it released on PS3, then I bought the remaster on PS4 and now I bought it on PC. With the state it is now, I cannot recommend it to anyone that wants to have smooth gameplay or a stable framerate. 

Usually I really want to have smooth gameplay but I forced myself to play the game and even had some fun. But every time there is an update or files are corrupted (which happened two times for me for no reason at all) you have to build shaders all over again, for almost an hour, if not even longer. 
There is almost constant stuttering and no matter on which settings or even resolution I tried playing, this game was just a hot pile of garbage performance wise. Extreme framedrops from 50fps to 30~ish out of nowhere, most of the time I had around 40-45 FPS when playing. 

Once they fix up the broken performance of this game, I will change my review to a positive one, but not in this state. Please Naughty Dog, don't partner up with Iron Galaxy anymore.

Yes, I waited for the shaders to be created. And yes, I also tried DLSS and this AMD trash...
Forget it. Even with 4090 and 13700k, you can't get The Last of Us to run smoothly.
16GB VRAM! Are you kidding me!? For what? For a PS3 remaster? Sure, the game looks fantastic. But so fantastic that it pushes high-end computers to the limit? Hell no! 
Other games, for example, look a lot more extreme and, uh, run better and don't put as much strain on the system by far. Cyberpunk in Overdrive mode runs better.... With less FPS, but smooth!
After about 60 minutes of setting up, I had enough and am considering refunding this garbage.
And this is a console port after all. So why is the controller control (lol) so bad? The stick is tilted almost halfway and you're still in the dead zone. Wow!
However, I don't forget that TLOU is actually a great game.

Just please fix it.
FFS!!
Edit: Patch 1.0.4
Still runs like crap. Stutter stutter stutter stutter.......
You can get rid of the strange stuttering if you set the FPS limit to open end. But then the PC always runs at full throttle, which of course makes it very loud.
But I like to limit the FPS down until the PC is quiet. Unfortunately, then the stuttering starts.
In addition, the still extremely lousy controller navigation. PLEASE decrease the Dead Zone!
Still not recommended, but a step forward. VRAM usage has also dropped by 5GB on Ultra.

The times I've been able to play it between crashes have been great but since it crashes frequently it's impossible to separate the quality of the game from the quality of the experience playing it, which has been a nightmare. I have tried every fix that has been suggested and nothing has helped. My system is better than the recommended setup and still apparently not good enough to run this game cleanly. To make matters worse Steam knows how bad the port is (they can read reviews same as everyone else) but still refuses to give me a refund because I've played the game for too many hours. Steam has a different definition of ""playing"" than i do. For example, I exceeded the number of played hours just in the time i spent waiting for shaders to build when I had to reinstall the game multiple times. Leaving the game running while i go and do my grocery shopping, coming back and still finding the shaders at 85% is not ""playing"" anything. It would be worth the wait if after all the time the game played smoothly, but it doesn't. I tried making my peace with the crashing but everyone has limits. A great game ruined by a trash port. Pre-ordering this game before the reviews were in was an expensive mistake I will never make with Steam again. It's too late for me; save yourselves!

Edit: Steam asked if I wanted to edit my review since I ""played"" the game for more hours. Ok, sure. After trying every single fix suggested online and several patches and an update from AMD specifically to handle this terrible port i will say it has upgraded from a complete trash fire to ""playable"" It's not great, it's still a memory hog and i had to move it to it's own SSD just to make the load times bearable (because even though the recommendation was 100GB  available it needed five times that just to load in less than a minute and not stutter at every checkpoint). So the game was bearable enough that I was able to finish it (logging in roughly three times as many hours as an average playthrough on a PS4). No I still don't recommend it, certainly not for the amount I paid for it.

If I have to make a comparison with titles that use much heavier engines, like Unreal Engine 5, I could take as an example Banisher or Lords of the Fallen which at maximum details achieve excellent performance and with excellent details; in The Last of Us it's not like that because this game absorbs an enormous amount of resources unnecessarily and has never been patched because the foundations are broken and irreparable, you can't fix something that is damaged at its core, because dev's wanted to save money on conversion.

🎀Imagine having to reach only 80 miles per hour with a Ferrari with the handbrake on; I don't think a Ferrari is necessary to reach such a low speed. But this game requires high-end hardware without any sense and it will be your hardware that has to compensate for the development mistakes.
Well done, you've reached the low 80 miles with your useless RTX4090 2000+ dollars card and you boast about it!? 
But you've been fooled/scammed twice!
The forum section regarding patches is closed to user comments, so you can't even expose what doesn't work or what should be corrected. Obviously, it's closed on purpose to avoid useless complaints; but it's not a good sign nor a good practice for marketing. Technical support for this game has long been abandoned.
https://steamcommunity.com/app/1888930/eventcomments/

The Last of US is not worth the full price at which it is sold and what has been said has nothing to do with the type of game or the storyline.

The best choice Sony has ever made is to entrust Nixxes (company purchased by Sony specifically for PC porting) with the conversion work for Horizon Forbidden West and for future PC porting, cutting off Iron Galaxy from everything and an excellent job has come out, Horizon looks like a native PC version, it doesn't look like a port and this should be an example.

On launch shaders ""only"" took 45 minutes to load instead of the commonly cited 2 hours - the fact that I'm even chalking this up to a win is ridiculous.  Beginning of the prologue playing as Joel's daughter was totally playable, not perfect performance but thoroughly playable.  Heck, I'm in the 40% club!

Wrong.  As soon as we get to Joel carrying the daughter in a more graphically demanding environment I drop to about 2 fps.  Yeah.  2.  Even getting to the menu to quit (instead of alt+f4) is difficult, and I'm still running at 2 fps in the menu, the heck is that?

It's no secret that this PC port was SERIOUSLY fucked over by something or the other. I'm not privy to all of the behind the scenes nonsense that may have screwed it over, but, I can sure talk about the results.

The game is BEATABLE - but performance hitches are heavy, almost to the point of a literal slideshow (I was checking my phone during hitches, talking to my friends over discord. This was with TLOU being the one big program I had running). Outside of those, the game runs at a muddy, but playable 30-50 FPS at most times, which checks out, since my PC falls below min specs.

The game plays shockingly well with KBM, and thanks to a recent update, you now no longer have to use more than the 1-4 keys to use the weapon cross, which is a personal saving grace IMHO. I've always liked cross-style favorites selections rather than hotbars because of this. If you've played it on playstation, it feels even better here with more precise control input, and the story is still great. Not the ""greatest video game story ever,"" like some marketers would like to pretend, but it's a nice, refreshingly real feeling take on the wolf and cub story.

I'd say in the grand scheme of things their were only a few segments in the entire game where i had major fps issues/stuttering combat was always smooth, Cut-scenes were fine etc etc. And yes as you've probably already read the Shaders took so long.

I'm not talking about whether the game crashes or not, I'm not talking about the hardware requirements or how the game was ported to PC. I'm talking exclusively about the game itself.

It's probably because I had totally different expectations.
Audio-visually, the game is truly phenomenal.

However, I don't understand how people here can write that the gameplay is equally phenomenal. What is so great about a game that is strictly linear? The game is divided into segments, and the essence of each segment is ""get from point A to point B, using a straight path"", without any choice. Ok, to get to point B, you have to kill a certain amount of freaks and/or soldiers and possibly move a certain object to the appropriate place - to be able to climb, descend or jump over something.

Simply put, the concept of the game is too simple, linear, one-dimensional, moron-friendly and as such - the game is totally uninteresting to me, it doesn't pull me to play further because it's not challenging (I'm not talking about the difficulty).

So, when we are speaking about gameplay - just compare it with Dying Light 1 & 2, Days Gone or Resident Evil. It is probably visually ahead of the mentioned ones, but gameplay (from my personal point of view) is incomparably worse.

Who cares about the visual impression - any recommendation for the game.

My experience so far: 2hrs download, launch, pop up due to older driver version (4 days old), crash, 20mins driver update, 58min shader compile, start game, fps stays at 120 (I get hopeful), get out of the intro cutscene and the frames go into the bog, the game says it's running at 80fps but I see maybe 30-40 actually displayed (massive frame times and stuttering), I look at the settings and try lowering them - I gain like 5-10 fps, I max them out for fun and my pc bluescreens.

EDIT:
So after several patches, the game was playable and I was able to finish it. I had 2 or 3 crashes during my playthrough but overall the gameplay was smooth and FPS were stable @2K ultra settings.

I had never played TLOU before the PC release. I bought it in preorder after seeing so many positive reviews saying that the game is a masterpiece and a 'must-play' title. I was pretty sure that I would enjoy it just like the others said.
The first 2-3 hours were indeed very good so I was excited. Unfortunately, those were the best moments for me because the game became repetitive pretty quickly. Maybe except for the graphics that I really liked, everything else was just okay/meh: story, gameplay, levels... There is no potential for the second playthrough because you don't make any choices that change the story.
After all the hype surrounding this game, I expected much more. I don't see any element done so brilliantly that would justify those 10/10s. The 'mixed' grade would be more adequate but since it is not here, I have to choose between yes/no and I go with thumbs down."

I'm used forcing games to run at a limited framerate like:
-Evil Within 1
-Nier Replicant
-Resident Evil 5
-Dead Space (2008)

I'm also used to downloading fan patches to get games to properly function like Resident Evil 5, Tomb Raider 1-5, etc. 

But the thing is, once that's all said and done, I can reasonable run the game at a stable framerate with no crashing. The port for this game is just as terrible as people are saying. I'm honestly left speechless and Naughty Dog and Neil Druckmann seemingly released this port without ever testing if it ran well on a PC at all. My hardware is more powerful than a PS5 and even if I put the settings on low and render the game at 720p the game REFUSES to reach a framerate of 60FPS due to their mind-boggling lack of optimization when it comes to compressing and streaming textures on PC.

Now, normally, I will see games with reviews like these and experience little to none of these problems. However, I am experiencing ALL of the issues including random crashes at inconsistent points in the game. Good luck EVER doing a permadeath run in this game because Naughty Dog put less than the bare minimum porting this to PC and let Iron Galaxy take the fall despite the port being mostly in-house.

However the current state of things is god-awful. I'm fortunate enough to have a very powerful PC, so when it runs, it runs fairly well. The issue here is that it lacks stability. The game crashes nearly once every two hours or so, and while that's annoying, the most debilitating part of these crashes is that the game will often force you to verify files afterwards. Once you've verified files, you've got to recompile shaders, which can take upwards of 45 minutes! And, to top it off, the cherry on top is that the game will often then crash WHILE COMPILING SHADERS, forcing you to begin the entire arduous process all over again.

Ironic that naughty dog preaches social justice and act like their the moral high ground yet they knowingly sale this unfinished trash to the public at over $60 . Of course they tested it and knew of all the issues yet still sold it because wanted to see how many people would buy it because of the show and make a quick buck then have audacity to blame the consumer they not have powerful pc. I have a 3080 I9 32 ram and averaged 50fps with crashes and long shader load times. 

Graphics are ok but do not see a huge difference to justify the vram costs.  The acting and story is great but the combat it utter trash. Got good reviews because of story but people overlooked the combat. Unless you shoot enemies in the head they will still come at you full force. I shot human enemy 3 times and still came at me, this is the same throughout the game. Stealth is a joke, enemies will spot you then know you exact location and swarm. Becomes tiresome.  

Notice none of the top game sites have reviewed the pc version to warn us. 100% sure if game ran great the sites would review to tell us how great it is.

This is my first time playing The Last of Us. I'm about 2/3 to 3/4 through and everything about this game is perfect.....except for the performance. As is apparently standard practice for game studios these days, the PC port receives little to no optimization and runs horrendously. I have an absolute beast of a PC (RTX 3080, 32-core 3.50 GHz Threadripper, 128 GB RAM) and the game runs at like 20 fps on Ultra graphics. The only way to play at a decent framerate is to lower the graphics to the point where it looks worse than the original release. However, the game is just so darn good I accepted the situation and played anyways. But now I've had to pause my playthrough because the most recent patch actually made the performance worse, to the point where it's absolutely unplayable. On the LOWEST graphics setting, it runs at less than 10 fps. 

I'm astounded at how little support this game is getting, considering how beloved the original is and the hype around the HBO show. I'm especially disappointed because I have LOVED the game so far.

It's just terrible that about 3 hours of my play time went towards building shaders for a game that requires medium-to-low graphics to run anywhere close to smoothly on a RTX 2060.

- Crashing may not fully crash your PC

- There's tons of crashes
- Starts the game and it crashes

- Performance issues (maybe related to crashes) on a Ryzen 7700X CPU and Radeon RX 7900XT GPU with 32GB RAM

I mean as a movie I'm sure it would be amazing, but the moment to moment gameplay is fucking boring. Even some of the game mechanics just don't seem to work. For example, holding a button to move silently while crouched - or even just sitting still - for some reason still alerts enemies that supposedly only ""see by hearing"" even a modest distance away.

The game needs to communicate much more clearly what it wants you to do. Trial and error-ing my way through Dark Souls or Elden Ring is easy because the game communicates everything very clearly. This game is - frankly - fucking dogshit in this respect. It doesn't communicate what's necessary multiple times. There's a point where you need to dive underwater, but the game just doesn't prompt you to do so despite it being the first time this mechanic is introduced. I've seen people complain about the ladder/plank carry puzzles, but those were the most straightforward part of the game. At least those are puzzles that you, as the player, are supposed to solve.

I'll say it again: this game is fucking painful to play. I want to like it so much but I just don't. I'm so disappointed. You'd honestly be better off just watching a compilation of the cutscenes on Youtube because that's EASILY the only part of the game that actually makes you want to keep going."

By the third restart, it prompted me to recompile my shaders again which I am NOT doing just for it to crash upon booting. Completely unplayable do NOT buy this until there's a real fix.

If it keeps crashing for you, try sacrificing looks for performance until it's (hopefully) fixed.

Camera jitter, that they claim has been fixed in 1.0.2.1 is still present for me.
Setting mouse to raw input and locking the framerate to 60 helped to reduce it.

That's what we get when games are being developed primarily for inferior systems.

I spent almost 2 hours starting the game, clicking new game, and get to building shaders just for the game to crash randomly; whether the shaders were built 1% or (the best one) 98%.

I’ve played other PlayStation ports (Days Gone, Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War) and didn’t have any issues. I was hoping Naughty Dog LLC would be able to keep up with other publishers, but they can only produce a game that was poorly ported to PC (30 series NVIDIA GPUs specifically had a problem, what the actual f*ck? I was on this list, btw). Nonetheless, the rancid hot garbage this game doesn’t seem to be fixed after Sh*tty Dog LLC pushed out FIVE (5) patches since release and the date of this review. Are they trying to compete with other certain ‘big title’ games from other companies that pushed a game out too soon that ended up not being playable on old generation consoles? Seems like Sh*tty Dog LLC is in the running to win….(5 hot fixes/patches in 2 weeks compared to other company's 5 hot fixes/patches in 2.5 months).

Additionally, the other company managed to send an apology to gamers about the mess at launch. Sh*tty Dog LLC? Nothing. Not a word. Just pushing out hotfixes that….let me check….still didn’t seem to fix anything from recent reviews.

Don’t waste your money.

Not like PlayStation and Sh*tty Dog are going to lose money on releasing a game on PC that was originally on the PS3...back in 2013...and then again on PS5 in Sept 2022, they don’t care about PC players.[/strike]





Leaving my prior review up for accountability. Even though I am now able to play the game and have enjoyed it thus far. I 1) got the game for free when I purchased a new AMD GPU for a SFF PC I was making, and 2) upgraded my GPU to a 4090 [though I did play shortly with my 3080]. Another AAA was recently released *cough - space themed game* that was an utter dumpster fire due to the lack of play-ability on most (99%) PCs. I sadly, was a dumba** and preordered both of these games.

Companies need to stop selling trash games upon release that are not optimized. PC players need to stop preordering (fool me once...) until they know the game is in a playable state. Naughty Dogs and PlayStation need to get their sh*t together and take the time to make a game playable day 1 instead of pushing a game out too soon.

Yes, there will be more PS games coming to PC. Yes, I hope they are good ones (GoW, TLOU part II, etc.) but I [b]will not preorder these games under any notion[/b] until I know they are playable or are on a severe discount."

When it unfroze it didn't sync up with the audio that was now several seconds ahead and instead just resumed playing where it had stopped originally, so now there was a several second delay between game audio and the image that was shown on the screen. Game was also installed on SSD so that most likely wasn't where the issue was.

2 hours playtime? 1 hour 50 minutes waiting for shaders to build. New patches make this process happen again. It never gets faster. Crashes often even just doing this.

Start playing, it runs pretty poorly for a 6700XT and a 5800X with 32GB DDR4 backing it.

Since the update, luckily I've only crashed once but the low fps at times is just frustrating to play a game where one minute you're ~100 fps then drop to as low as 3 fps, especially when you have clickers or something rushing you, I'm hoping others had better performance after the update because it's gone backwards for me, there's plenty of reviews saying don't get it yet anyways but I'm just frustrated with how this has gone so it has to get a negative review in it's current form."

As much as I love this game, like many others I can't recommend it in its current state. It's great if you have high end hardware like me, but I can definitely see this being an issue for the average gamer.

Running this on a 4090, i7 12700K, 32GB DD5 RAM and NVMe, the game itself runs great. I'm over 100 FPS at almost all times with DLSS off and most things maxed (shadows I keep on Med/High). That being said, this game is definitely a CPU and RAM hog, not to mention the VRAM. I'm currently playing at 1440P, so that may or may not be the same case for you. There are a few micro stutters here and there when turning (could be a CPU bottleneck for me or could be the game), but it's nothing annoying or even immersion breaking.

The game looks beautiful and there is nothing better than playing it M+K, but if you are running with any kind of card under a 3000 series you may see some issues. I personally have not had any crashes whatsoever, but I did suffer the dreaded ""Building Shaders"" timesink. It took me about 15 - 20 minutes to get my shaders built, but I know there are folks who have had it much worse. The game is definitely poorly optimized. If they get this patched out, it will be great.

On launch it told me i was using a previous version of my graphics card driver and that i should update it and even listed a version number.  I checked Geforce Experience and the Nvidia website, bothof which told me i was on the most up to date driver.  A driver with a lower number than the game had told me i should use.  Great start!!  

Should have booted the game sooner it turns out, as i then had to sit through a 45 minute shader cache process.

Eventually started the game up and played through the prologue and was pretty impressed to be honest.  Haven't played the game since PS3 so was blown away by how good it looks now.

Until i got to 20 years later,  as soon as the cutscene had finished and it dropped me into the game in the alleyway, there was a graphical issue that made it impossible to see literally half of what was on screen as it was like i was looking through a grill and could only see parts of the game (in beautiful shades of grey) through this grill.

Immediately turned the game off as this turd still needs a lot of polishing before it becomes even a shiny turd.  At the moment it is just a regular old sloppy turd.

Don't waste your money for now. Maybe they will be able to get it in a half way acceptable state some day, but i don't think that day will be any time soon!

Good job. 

My fellow consumer, this negative review shan't leave the graces of this steam store page just through patching here and there, 'nay. My fellow brother (Or sister we're all good in the hood) my complaints are directed towards the company itself and their business model oh yes.

1. This is a port, ladies and gentlemen. This is not a remake, nor a remaster. No. This is a port, with minor enhancements. Minor, enhancements, sire. A port takes way less effort, time, and resources. So, my fellow gentlemen of the digital realm, how was this port handled o' so terribly?

2. The Last of Us Part I is an extremely linear game. Yes, art teams and level designs knock it out of the park, but, in the end, it is a linear game. Now Batman Arkham Knight I understand, big AAA game, with a large world, and it is indeed a *multi-layered* world, with numerous side activities. Iron Galaxy's major mess with that is totally understandable.. But TLOU? Extremely linear, uni-dimensional, how could you mess up this badly?

3. People reading this with high end rigs: Do not purchase this now. If you see positive reviews as of this time stating that the game is playable, that is because these are probably users playing on 1080p or relatively close. Playing this game right now on 4k and above will absolutely gut your VRAM. It eats it for breakfast. 

4. This is a disservice to the fans that actually left positive reviews for your game during this time:

There are numerous people that actually endured the harsh bugs and crashes, immersion breaking errors, just to play a game they really enjoyed. You as developers releasing a game in a half-assed state, serving those die-hard fans who *truly* cherish your games is an absolute disservice, so don't go around spewing that ""Oh sorry this isn't the Naughty Dog experience you're used to"" nonsense because honestly that is both aggravating and highlights your sense of entitlement. 

Again, this is not a review that is negative for the ""bugs"" that will be patched out in a couple of months (Yeah surprise they'll need months to patch the bugs for PC builds of all ranges, surprise.) but it is one that is targeting the business model itself. This greed for the almighty dollar and blatant disregard to your fans time and resources is quite memes, and you had to do this to TLOU 1. This isn't even the Woke of Us Part II man."

On the one hand, the game is very addictive and fun. Story is interesting, gameplay is versatile, likable characters.

On the other hand, the game is very predictive, the majority of your enemies are humans and not zombies, and there are couple of instances where you should be able to pass certain sections undetected but the game does not allow you to. I pointlessly wasted time trying to stealth my way through.

The elephant in the room is obviously the performance and optimization. Playing on 1440p all low with a 12700K and a 7900XT results in a framerate of 100-130, sometimes dipping as low as 70. Needless to say this is completely unacceptable. 

The ""building shaders"" time takes between 45 to 50 minutes with the above-mentioned hardware and a Gen 4 NVMe while Resizeable-Bar is enabled. Loading a save/reloading a checkpoint can sometimes take up to 3 minutes. In addition, sometimes the game has to pause in the middle of the action to load up to 2 minutes. 

The game has clearly not been play-tested at all, and was released in an unacceptable condition. I highly recommend purchasing the game ONLY after all of its issues will have been fixed."

This has been my favorite game of all time since it released on PS3 and I used to play it over and over and over again just because I loved it so much. The game itself is an amazing game but Iron Galaxy really take a shit on this game. Naughty Dog, if you care about your fans and one of your biggest games ever, you would fire Iron Galaxy and fix this port yourselves, because this is truly disgraceful.

I am 10hrs into the game at the time of writing this review to make sure it was just as bad as everyone is saying it is. It;s worse than I thought. I have had a total of 7 crashes, one of which required a full PC restart. The game somehow deleted my graphics driver from my computer causing me to have to spend an hour or two figuring out how to manually redownload it and the game changes my sensitivity back to default every time I open the game. (Btw 10hrs in and ive only just reached the Hotel because building shaders took about an hour and a few times it wasnt responding and I had to wait.)

I cannot say this loud enough. ***DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET*** Iron Galaxy took a massive shit on my favorite title and it should not be allowed to stay like this. If Naughty Dog appreciates their fans even a little bit, theyll do something about this because this is simply unacceptable."

Positives: the graphical updates to this game are jaw-droppingly good (currently running everything on high). Everything from the rubble strewn about post-apocalyptic Pittsburgh to the water rippling & churning at the dam to the eerie cannibal lodge to the sunset-bathed town of Lincoln--everything just works & builds this very believable world. Also, slight tweaks to the bow-and-arrow mechanics are smart and very much appreciated. Some of the skins (like Ellie's ""Game of Thrones"" t-shirt and Joel's default pistol and shotgun) look great. And most importantly, the story remains untouched and just as gripping as it was when I first played it in 2013.

Negatives: I'll never, ever understand why developers ask $60 for a remake. I didn't think it was justified with all the Resident Evils nor Dead Space, so to charge that much for titles that are a decade-plus old? Be reasonable. Also, graphical glitches like characters getting soaking wet at random intervals or Joel sprouting sasquatch eyebrows might be just as hilarious as the naked T-pose on vehicles in Cyberpunk 2077, but it does get old after a while. My biggest issue in this regard is the water reflections looking whcky as hell at medium distances and appearing like Lego blocks are being reflected back to me. And just because some of these issues have gotten patched doesn't let the developers off the hook. I busted out laughing when one of the first screens greeting my newly installed game asked me to ""help us build the best PlayStation experience."" I mean, come on guys...that kind of proofing / auditing / game checking is kiddie stuff and just reeks of laziness. And while the game ""only"" crashed on me twice in 30 gameplay hours (currently on 2nd playthrough), they had occurred at some pretty godawful times which then required having to re-do massive stealth areas. Also, what's with games these days eclipsing 130+ GB? Seriously, they couldn't condense that code any better & require that much hard drive space? I get Call of Duty and some other titles are even larger, but that still doesn't excuse the fact that it's lazy programming that could've been done better. Devs should want to do better as this would make their game more readily accessible to a wider audience. God help the poor souls trying to run this thing on anything other than an SSD. There's probably more that I'm forgetting to list here, but I think I've made my point.

Bottom line: this is a very amazing game that I want to recommend to everyone. But it's *NOT* worth it at this price and *NOT* with all the myriad of technical issues presently plaguing it. I hope Naughty Dog stays committed to fixing this mess and doesn't chalk it up to PC player-elitism or some other b.s. reasoning. Because this is a worthwhile game & I'm glad it's finally released to the PC...just not in this broken state. Please be better & give the PC community a better experience."

---

My review is essentially an echo chamber at this point. The game itself is excellent. I have gotten solid performance for the 2 hours I spent actually playing it. The problem is that I needed to leave the game running in the background for 94 minutes the first time so I could compile shaders. So of my 4 hours I have recorded, only about 50% of that was spent actually playing the game.

The second time I loaded the game, it decided to compile shaders again. Between my work and family responsibilities, I only have a few hours per week to play games, so waiting 90+ minutes on EACH load to recompile shaders is absolutely asinine. Sony, Naughty Dog, Iron Galaxy, and all other personnel responsible for this port should be absolutely embarrassed.

If this game wasn’t gifted to me, I would refund it and wait a few months until the publisher and its development team can get their act together, because this game is basically shovelware in its current state."

I have owned the Last of Us on both PS3 and PS4 where I enjoyed multiple play throughs on each console. Now, eagerly awaiting the launch of this title on PC only to be met with a mediocre start to the game. Within the first 30 minutes of the game I had a GPU related crash to desktop. Normally this would be a problem but considering the state of most games upon launch this can be forgiven but not forgotten. Oddly, this game has moments of looking visually incredible but then other moments the game appears to be running at 720P, during these 720P moments the film grain effect makes it look like you took your PC monitor into the bathroom during a hot shower due to the pure blurriness. Disabling film grain leaves you with an image that appears as if disabling film grain just turned the slider up on color noise reduction. Meaning that the image looks blurry and smooth (not in a good way). Overall the games frame rate goes from okay to dog shit at the drop of a dime. To the games credit I am not running this on a super computer which is arguably the only way to get it to not be a stuttery mess but even that appears to still be a problem. What is most alarming is that required specs far exceed the console counterparts this game was originally released on. All be it on PS4 it ran at 30 frames, it didn't have nearly the same problems that my middle tier PC seems to have due to piss poor optimization. Again, as i previously alluded to, this just seems to be the state of gaming lately and i am hopeful additional optimization patches come out and correct the performance issues. For now I don't recommend but each patch seems to fix some overarching performance issues.

Edit: Upon playing the game more I have noticed numerous graphical glitches that are funny to see once and down right infuriating the second time you see it. The main killer one for me is a weird glitch that causes characters hair, including eyebrows, to render incorrectly causing all characters hair to look like their hair is made of trapezoids and their eyebrows to closely resemble Oscar the grouch.... funny once, completely unacceptable the next 18 times it happened over the course of my game play (including almost every cut scene). The hair issues are most commonly seen on Ellie while the eyebrows can be seen on Joel, where Joel's green flannel really illustrates the similarities to Oscar the grouch..."

But, when it comes to this port, right now it is not the optimal way to experience this game for the first time. For example, approximately 10 of the 14 hours I have spent playing were in fact just idling overnight letting the shaders compile. 

Once the initial shader compilation had finished I almost immediately ran into issues with the game just crashing to desktop before loading the prologue. After a few attempts, I was able to get ingame and progress to the first chapter, and get my first taste of the improved graphics and game engine - which are, in fairness, very impressive. I then updated my GPU driver to address a few reported issues, and following this had to wait another 5 hours for the shaders to recompile...

I would suggest waiting a few months for a couple of patches to drop to address some of the more critical issues. If you are desperate to play the game and do not want to wait this long (perhaps you've been watching the HBO show), and happen to own a recent PlayStation console, the experience on that platform will undoubtedly be better right now. Plus, you can find the first remaster that was released back in 2014 at a pretty steep discount compared to this."

Looking deeper at the log files on Windows 11, the reboot was due to the game causing lower level issues with nvidia drivers. This affected the hardware fan controller functions. The GPU was essentially overworked for no damn reason, and the drivers just shit the bed. Everything was up-to-date. 1 Soft crash back to windows, followed by a hardware level system restart was all I needed to blatantly say, ""DO NOT BUY THIS"".

But i am gonna be honest here. Everyone involved in movement needs to be fired. How is Sony still so bad at movement? Immersion is not an excuse to make garbage movement.

You are supposed to be playing a person, yet you are playing a fucking BOAT. Everytime you want to turn or stop it will take half a century.

Also, the ""quick turn"" movement is absolutely hilarious, the game just needed you to be able to backpedal at a snails pace instead of turning and moving at normal speeds. This is a complete joke.

AFTER patch 1.0.2.0.
Played time 12 Hours.

The Last of Us Part 1 on PC is a true disappointment. Hold off on purchasing this game until the issues are resolved. In addition to the previously mentioned problems, the game is virtually unplayable due to constant crashes. What's worse, the save system doesn't work properly, forcing players to repeatedly go through the same sections of the game.

I cannot describe my frustration with these issues. A game that should be an amazing experience is impossible to get through because the constant crashes and save system issues discourage playing. Save your money and your nerves until these problems are fixed.

I cannot recommend The Last of Us Part 1 on PC due to its numerous issues. As much as I love the game's story, the poorly optimized port severely hinders the experience.

1 - Bought the game.
2 - Downloaded over 70GB of data.
3 - Waited around 20 minutes or more for the shader process.
4 - Finally started a new game, only to face around 5 minutes of loading time.
5 - Game starts, watched the first cutscene, gameplay begins, performance seems smooth, and then... CRASH!
6 - Restarted the game, tried to continue, faced another 5 minutes of load time, cutscene ends, and CRASH!
7 - Restarted the game in safe mode, another 5 minutes of load time, skipped the cutscene, played for 10 seconds, and CRASH!
8 - Verified game files on Steam, restarted the game, faced another 20 minutes of shader processing, followed by another 5 minutes of load time, and yet another CRASH.

While I have been eagerly anticipating playing this game for years, the PC port is a huge letdown. Despite having a decent gaming setup, the game runs poorly and crashes consistently. It's hard to enjoy the game when it is plagued with such issues. The lack of replayability and corridor-style gameplay further diminishes the experience.

I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game on PC unless you have an extremely high-end setup or until the optimization issues are resolved. The Last of Us Part 1 on PC is broken. While the story is great, the constant crashes and texture bugs make it nearly unplayable. Save your money and time until the game is fixed.

Until crashes, performance, and overall stability is corrected, this review will remain negative.

That being said, I feel very weird about the release of this title. I waited to play it for years and now that I have the totally redone version on TLoU pt 2's engine, I'm both elated yet disappointed. I don't know if I was expecting more or maybe I was spoiled by open world titles that encouraged dumb fun. Make no mistake, I am a huge fan of narrative corridor shooters, Bioshock and the Metro series being among my favorites, which makes it weird that I'm not totally floored by this game. For me, the entire appeal of this game is the story and while I did love it, it cannot uphold a game alone. Pt 1 is plagued by being a relic of it's time but also having the upgrades of the sequel, I desperately tried to find more reason to explore the game's world or refine my combat or stealth approaches but it's soooooo handicapped by the corridor-style gameplay, there's not much space there for you to experiment, it's either Option A vs Option B or just straight up Option A. Now, this game's been around for 10+ years so there's really not much to say as it's all pretty well known at this point. The game is good, don't get me wrong, it just features virtually no replayability to me and it's why I am awaiting Pt 2 to come to PC because while it does butcher the story of the first game, it nails the gameplay much better."

I think now the smart play is to wait a couple of months after release and then buy the game, once they fix all the game braking bugs. that goes double if your pc is not that powerful.  ITs annoying ...... they should make the game cheaper on release cuz of all the bugs and once they fix the game they should charge full price because the game is now complete ... i feel like that would be more fair .......   what we need to do is not buy games on release anymore so these game devs get the message... hit them where it hurts people ..... their money .. vote with your wallet  make them scared to release a broken game   cuz if we keep buying broken games then they will keep selling us broken games..... its sad how they messed up the release on this amazing game"

Bioshock and The Last of Us are my favorite games of all time so I was looking forward to writing a very positive review when this game released. I saw the hate that the game was getting because of all the technical issues and decided to wait a couple of weeks to see if the bugs were worked out. I had seen a patch helped some and was willing to give it a shot. 

This game looked better on PS3. I don't know how this is possible, but I clearly have a better system than that and it just looks bad. The performance is just not where it should be. Sony get Nexus to fix this and steer clear of whomever you used to port this game over!

EDIT: So I've played an additional 8 hours of game-play. This game doesn't crash on me like most have complained about. However, as I said before, the game is horribly optimized. I would suggest waiting until they have all the bugs fixed. There are far too many texture blurs. If you do decide to get the game....As people have said before, wait for the shaders to load on your first playthrough.

I don't have a state of the art system but I'm working with enough. For those that are curious I'm running a Legion 5 RTX 3060 6GB and Ryzen 7 CPU. The game will work, it's just not optimized properly and I don't understand how it was allowed to be released in this state. 

AFTER UPDATE, patch v1.0.3 4/15/23:
To think that the optimization couldn't get any worse....This patch has made the game almost unplayable in my opinion. Now the shaders are taking even longer than any previous patch and ANY OTHER game on the market EVER! Sony has really messed this up and they should give us our money back. After waiting an hour for the shaders to load, the game plays worse on my system than it did before. Will update should anything change, but this is unacceptable and I would NOT buy this game in the state it is in!

After patch v1.0.04, 4/28/23:
It looks like they finally fixed it. So after owning the game for almost a month now, they finally were able to fix it. This game is the best game of all time (my opinion), but released in the most poor quality possible. I am going to put a thumbs up on this game because it really is a great game. However, I don't support what the studio did by releasing this game in the state it was in. I'm sure it's still not where it should be. Lesson to everyone out there and even myself: DON'T PRE-ORDER GAMES because we the consumers are being taken advantage of by corporate gurus that just want our money. This game is a perfect example but if this isn't enough look at the newly released Jedi Survivor (I know not the same studio, but it's a perfect example of what corporations are doing: charging higher dollar for lower and lower quality). Again, thumbs up for the game but thumbs down for the way in which it was released. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

UPDATE:
Well....I thought they fixed it, but once I reached the sniper portion (I don't want to spoil this game for anyone so I'm being vague) the game slows down to 6 fps. Not going to beat a dead horse. Just wanted to let you guys know that the game is just not optimized."

But you can't get to all the good stuff because it's so broken. My specs are over the recommended and I run it at 720p and it still has stuttering. Stutters that don't even show on the fps counter. Nothing is being maxed out. I also get told when I launch I don't have the right driver when I'm pretty sure Nvidia knows better about what's the latest driver then the broken game does. It's vram requirement is absurdly high. Apparently a weaker card than mine according to them should run on high at 1440p, and to get to high on my card I need to go to 720p. I should be able to at least hit the equivalent settings to a ps5, especially with dlss. But apparently having textures that hold up to me even glancing at them takes a ton of vram. I get not being able to run at the max, but I wasn't expecting to. I expected to be able to use textures that didn't look like the ones from the ps3. The recommended environmental textures I got were worse than the ps3 ones and the dynamic textures didn't look much better. PC players had to wait nearly seven extra months for this. At the moment is barely runs, and for some people it doesn't. Every fix they have seems to be dancing around the bigger problems in favour of small ones. Even though some of the issues in the patch notes don't seem to be actually fixed anyway. I spend more time in the settings than playing it. The PS5 does not have over 40 gigabytes of combined ram in it. Why do I need that much to run at the same settings at 720p. I am certainly not preordering from Sony again. PC players shouldn't still be treated like second class customers that you throw a broken product to half a year later to scoop up some extra money. You keep sending out stuff like this and people will just not bother buying from you. Hell it doesn't encourage me to get a ps5 if your quality assurance didn't flag ""barely runs"" as a problem. If the game not starting for most people isn't a big enough issue to be flagged before release I don't know what is. At the rate the next big Sony release will probably smother me in my sleep, and they would still blame my drivers."

Btw running on a Ryzen 5 5600X, 32gb RAM and RTX 3070 TI. 
The VRAM- Okay so the Vram in the menus is just complete cap. It says i am over the limit at 9.3 GB with everything on high/Ultra and DLSS on Balanced but task manager and the ingame vram counter that you can turn on say only 7.7 GB. 
The performance- Other than the glaring issue of it not being properly optimised the game does run around 60 fps sometimes 40 if in larger areas on high/ultra DLSS Balanced and 2k resolution with the only issue being that my cpu is 100% most of the time. But after all that said the game is great both story, combat and exploration but i dont think it is advisable to buy it yet."

Even on 1.0.2.0 in SOME areas (eg slums, up the stairs) there is stuttering/ fps drops no matter the resolution settings etc, it will stutter (frametime spikes when panning the camera) and drop to 84 fps max (720p low!).Capping the framerate doesn't help.Other areas seem fine.
Clearly there is something fundamentally wrong with this port.
Hard pass until (if) they fix it.
Edit: patch 1.0.3 still microstuttering in many areas. Restarting the game fixes things for a while(which is absurd) until it starts stuttering again. Always under the vram limit. Things go from buttery smooth to microstutter hell mostly when i enter a new area. 4k dlss quality ultra settings (except environmental textures  high in order to stay under the 12gig vram limit)
Hard pass still, unless you like to play 60-70fps with constant microstuttering (in some areas).

I'm curious what kind of QA Testing is being done before any release for this game. It runs worse than Cyberpunk with Raytracing on.

Frequent crashes especially when loading cutscenes, or when starting the game.

Quality-wise the worst game launch I have ever personally experienced by an incredible margin. Launching this pile of shit at a price point of 70€ is customer abuse at best.

Of my listed 7 hours, I have spend close to 5 compiling shaders, because of various issues in game and driver updates.


Update July 2023: 
With the most recent update (1.1) it is finally playable, the framerates are more stable, and compiling shaders still takes way longer than almost any other game (15-25 minutes) but is more reasonable. It still doesn't run great, but will work fine with reasonable hardware, set aside the stutters and how incredibly CPU bound this is for no sensible reason.

HOWEVER after the most recent patch all the visual bugs seen on youtube are all gone at least for me, i have had 4 crashes in total all of which were early game and 60% of the time i was running the game at 80fps - 100fps with the lowest it got was 45. So why still leave a negative review? because i have; a 3070, 32 gigs of ram and a ryzen 9 5900, i know my machine is not what most people will have and even with my hardware this game struggled.  

the game itself is fantastic, the story is amazing and the game play (at least on keyboard and mouse) if so fun, the gun play has a weight to it i rarely feel in other games (even if it is just stealth gears of war), Each connecting melee hit from Joel has weight behind it that makes every hit have a deep impact.

This game is amazing, and i am glad that it has come to pc (i cannot wait to see what the mods for this game are gonna be like) but i cannot in good conscious recommend it in this state, i recommend waiting until it has more stability patches OR when it goes in a big sale.

The game plays really well for the most part I played through with Ultra High graphics and it was smooth as can be with one exception, there are some scenes that are definitely not optimized and you can tell when they begin and end. As soon as a fight started and a series of sneaking and fighting was expected through the game it started to drop frames to below 20 FPS, I changed every setting I could and does not matter what it was on, it continued to be below 20 FPS. I tried everything from Ultra to lowest and anything between and it did not change a thing which tells me its either needing a driver update for the Intel A770 or the game is needing a patch. It was so hard to not get distracted by how bad the frame drop was that it really robbed the fun factor to experience of the game. But as soon as the 'scene' ended the Frames went completely back to normal like nothing happened and the game was a great experience until then. Only other complaint I have other then this is I was using an Xbox controller and It would not let me shoot the pistol until I changed to my mouse and shot once with it, went back to the xbox controller and it then allowed me to shoot going forward after that. Odd Bug. I have not played through a large portion of the game only about 2 hours worth so far (1 hour of play time so far is building the shaders twice because it was patched and had to build shaders again after the first patch). The game itself is fun and I would definitely give it a buy assuming the bugs are still being worked out, as of now if things stay the way it is I would not give it a buy."

As far as the game and story line are concerned, great if not a little cliché . 
Story is pretty decent, and never having played  the original or sequel it's well narrated.

These are my current specs not the best i'm sure but far from the worst, and I can run some of the newest games in full ultra settings at 1080/1440p with high frame rates no problem yet in this game I quite frequently drop below 60 like well below 60 especially during combat sequences. 
Not only that but it feels like it has motion blur turned on even though its off in the settings which I find quite jarring and its giving me a headache trying to play it. 
I've not been able to play the game much I am just past the point of 1st meeting Ellie I can't play it anymore due to the issues I noted. Its really not good when Sony's and Naughty Dogs flagship franchise is this bad on its PC debut. 

Another issue I had and I know many others have been in the same boat but 3.5 plus hours to compile shaders is just outrageous I have never known a game take so long to compile shaders before and speaking of knowing stuff I have also never known a game throughout my 30+ years of gaming for a game to require almost oll of my Vram, 11+GB out of 12GB of Vram just to play and my settings are not even maxed out like how can a 10 year old game require so much Vram.

This is the only way I have found to make it work smoothly to some extent.

Wow.. There is no denying this seems to be built like a house of cards waiting for a slight blow of the wind. From shadows to the characters hair. I took a screen shot of the hair, if you want to see. I am pretty sure it is the first shot I took. Looks like clay. 

To be fair, zero crash so far. But it is only an hour (well, 40 min) playtime. I have just under an hour left before a refund. I stopped and decided to download the ""hot fix"". Boot up aaaand it seems the shaders have apparently reset. So.. if I am lucky, I have forty minutes left. Already tired, I'll try again tomorrow. 

So far though? STAY AWAY. There has been I think three patches and this 30 series ""hot fix"" (a lot of the comments under the ""fix"" state it didn't help, well one person said it did...so.. there's that). But considering I do not care and I have time to refund, I downloaded this ""fix"" to see for myself if anything seemed better. I'll try tomorrow and update. I can say this though, your GPU should have at least 10gb. The 8gb under the RECOMMENDED is, at least for now, a straight up lie. 

Predictions For Tomorrow?

NOT A F**KING CHANCE.

UPDATE! 
So shaders finished.. again. In about the same time if slightly less at 15 minutes. The hot fix is 100% required. It actually did help. ZERO crashes for me thus far. Game graphics are very clean after hot fix. Still a stutter here and there but I actually mean here and there. During checkpoints / saving. Outside that, didn't notice. I felt something was off but I remembered a ""fix"" i found a while ago when PC gaming. If you're running higher frames, don't forget to crank up your sensitivity if using a controller. I moved it from 30 to 65. Which cleaned up this ""off"" feeling I had. I knew time was running out (still upset about the shader thing) and so the final test I could do. I shut the game down and booted again. Will there be a third time for shaders? FIND OUT NEXT TIME ON! Kidding. No. Not sure why it needed it twice. Maybe the hot fix, I do not know. But this time I loaded right in. Load times are > = 60 seconds. Something like that. Kind of long for what I am used to. 

Is this a be all end all? No. Look, the sharder thing is a massive issue. Taking up VALUABLE time the player can verify if this is good for the money. I was only able to pop the first firefly trophy (very beginning) and take down ONE enemy. The rest is story set up and you guessed it, shaders. 

So in the end, this is a tough one to call. I HATE modern companies spitting on consumers. Its as natural as laying off bottom rung and working your way up. So, I STILL have to say, stay away for now. Do I think they'll fix it? I do. Batman proved that and this IS TLOU. Sony won't let this go. I have to admit, I am still thinking of refunding for now. I do not have 2hrs, I have 117 min. I am low key worried of the next 15 hrs of play time for ANYTHING to crop up. 

However, after some patches and a hot fix for the GPU, and let's be honest, most do NOT come back for their reviews, I wanted to give y'all an updated look and see where it is now. Playing the guinea pig. It is a great game (played on PS4 years ago). It is actually the first game ever to get me to replay it. My ex and I would sit down a year (drought), and replay as she watched. It's a great drama with fun enough game play. 

Not to be mean, if Iron has this reputation, why would Sony hire, I do not know. I didn't even game during the Batman PC fiasco and even I heard of that. But here we are. Careful with this one. If you get it. Play it as I have. However, go for the hot fix first. This could save you valuable time in the long run. Give an updated review. 

UPDATE 2
Two crashes. One in photo mode (4/6/23). The other, while playing. Not sure whats happening but the error states something wrong with the files. So I am now verifying the integrity of the download. This is happening after the big 4/7/23 update. I tried going back in first and it won't even load my game without an issue. We will see if verifying fixes everything. I'll update once it is done. 

UPDATE 3
Verifying fixed it. Great session. Then today happened. Game looks like drivers need updating, but they don't. Back to verifying. This is a weird issue. However, resetting fixed it. Best way to describe is it made Joel look like a werewolf detective off of that TallTale game years ago. 

After Beating
Wait for sale. Although the game is much better, this optimization crap has to end. I don't even care for Part 2 if this is what we will expect (also the story goes to ish). I am thankful to have one of the greatest on PC, but to treat it this way? Seemed we appreciate it more than the ones who own it. Good game, bad port. Basically, same ish, different day. 

Update (4/13/23)
Updated drivers... Any driver version other than the one Iron Galaxy told you to use STILL causes massive issues (two weeks from release). I actually beat the game on the version the patch notes recommended (531.60, something like that). I was thinking it must be fixed by now. I started a NG+ and as soon as I saw Sarah's hair (looks like worms),  that's when I knew, I f**ked up. 

This is why the thumb is STILL down. 

UPDATE 4/14/23
Still not fixed after latest patch. Runs even worse. I joke you not. I am running the same settings as before, I instantly drop to 10/15 fps. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. 

Update 4/26/23
After patch, validating shaders (for the 6th time). I expect that now. Done within 15 minutes as usual. I loaded in and looked good. FPS was good too. Outside the shaders, it seems most issues are fixed. For the issues it had, get on sale. Gotta prove a point. 

Update 5/13/23
I am happy for another patch but tired of sharder's having to reset. Come on man! 

Hope this helps!"

But onto the review...

Decent game, story and gameplay wise, but it is buggy. However, the big issue for me, is that the graphics are too all over the place for it to be really good. DLSS and TAA share massive blows and sharpening in many areas is overdone and makes DLSS look great in some sences and bad in others. There is so much work that needs to be done for this game. Movement brings with it slight blur and texture smearing even with DLSS enabled (though its far less than TAA). Its plain as day that the flaws of taa are present here no matter what scaling option you choose. This port is clearly a lazy cash grab. Textures are too far apart quality wise for this to be flawless (a major telltale sign of console games). LOD Is terrible even at ULTRA because a lot of textures suck and this game really needs a good texture pack or at least better quality than what they give us. Trees and a lot of foilage are super low rez and that breaks immersion immediately when you see it compared to the sharper objects (hence why the base image is so blurry w/ taa). Sharpening filters are overdone for a reason. A default ""built in"" sharpener exists for TAA. And if you use DLSS, its active on top of the DLSS sharpening.  So DLSS looks oversharpened in many areas even if you crank DLSS sharpening down to 0, and all I got is eye pain from trying to focus on low detail objects that are oversharpened. Cranking the sharpening down is a must for DLSS, or disabling the default sharpening is what i would suggest if you're going to use DLSS in the first place (but this has to be done by modding the EXE file). Its not hard to understand why its easy to see these flaws as only PC gamers could because consolers have been fooled for so long due to how bad the hardware is and how little devs care to produce proper games even for them. One major reason why ill never own an XBOX. I dont want devs telling me what looks good. Otherwise no games will ever innovate as the markets will become too complacent.

Performance is bloody terrible for what little the scenes really have to offer. I have a 3090 and it runs mostly between 45 and upwards of 80+ fps. Totally nonsensical. Companies get so lazy these days with all aspects of designs.  They think sharpening filters is enough to make a good immersive game, so they skimp on the detail of objects and all you get are grainy images after you add sharpening to it. TAA OOTB is blurry as all hell (no change there) and requires lots of sharpening for it to be playable (hence why at default DLSS not only has sharpening in the game, but also has additional sharpening that sets itself to 35 everytime i enable it). This is the fault of consoles and the markets going to try and dupe people rather than try to fix the issue of having low res textures (gotta be able to charge you twice for the ""enhanced edition"").

Honestly, they deserve every ounce of criticism and negativity they are getting. I hope they learn from this, but the way these lazy cash grabs are going its probably more of the norm and i highly doubt anything will be done in the near future.

Not only do i recommend caution for anyone who might want to pick this up (especially if you're sensitive to blur and bad anti aliasing), but i probably, personally, wont even bother picking up the second part. DEEP SALE or at least a 6 month wait to see how much they care to fix any of this."

My Review
Coming from a background of playing both games on PlayStation I was incredibly excited about the game releasing for PC. Uncapped frame rates, improved graphic options, same epic story line, what wasn't to like?

Unfortunately as with many recent ports from console to PC so much has been lost to gain so little.

You don't need to look far to see the numerous issues with this release but from my perspective

Shader problem
Shaders building after install is crazy, either do it as part of the actual install before we run the game OR have a specific extension to the steam refund policy that the developers will cover claims against, mine took 25 minutes to install, crashed twice during it at the main menu at which point it reverted me back to 0% again, so it total approx 45 minutes stuck at the main menu before I could even play it

Optimisation 
Again you don't need to read very far in these reviews. I fail to understand how so many developers struggle to port a console game to a PC and bump into the same repeat issues each time, stuttering, crashing (Frequently) and frame rate drops are common. I'm not running an average rig, its well above the recommended specs and well within the ultra settings but you need 14GB of VRAM to run this game at max, it eliminates a massive portion of your potential audience getting to enjoy it how its meant to look. TLOU was already a very pretty game on consoles, so I abjectly refuse to believe it requires such a massive increase in graphics power for what you actually get, plainly put its simply not good enough and massively unoptimised.

Crashes
Frequent, frustrating, I experience at least one per hour of game play, sometimes more. Today over a 20 minute play-through I had three of them, each time setting you back to the last save or checkpoint. There is a game mode involving permadeath and no manual saves. Good luck trying to do that one until this is significantly improved!

Stability is non-existent. Its painful, because what little you do get to play looks stunning, the same amazing story but with superior graphics, I want to play it! But each crash just adds to the frustration and reset progress means you end up giving up. I can see the huge effort that went into making the game look so much better for PC players but its annoyingly locked behind crashes to desktop that become so off-putting that you give up. I had a spare hour today I'd have loved to dedicate to the game, in the end after those 3 CTDT I quit after 20 minutes, and probably won't be back until its undergone some major patching 

When it works its spectacular 
This is the major annoyance. TLOU isn't a bad game. Anyone who has played it on PlayStation already knows this. So the thought of those uncapped frames and graphics options should make this a done deal and a massive seller. And when you actually get into the game and can play it, it really does exceed expectations. Shadows, lighting, reflections and water effects all look a million times better than the console version. I spent an actual 5 minutes just playing with the light coming through a window to see how it reflected off the pools of water and walls, it looks that good, simply lost in my own little world admiring the efforts of the devs to make this the best version of the game.

But as mentioned, this immersion is broken far too frequently by stuttering and crashes to really have the opportunity to enjoy it.

Conclusion
I love the series. For me its a perfect example of where entertainment meets immersion meets fantastic storytelling to really get you to care about the characters. I wanted to love this version of the game, I want to play it.

But the lazy port they have made, the stability issues, the simply bad decisions they have made such as shaders and constant crashing, these all just leave a bitter taste in the mouth.

When you can get it to run and can spend longer than 5 minutes just in the moment of the game, its truly an amazing experience. But you just know that the next scene is going to not just be a test of your stealth skills to get past the next clicker, but also a test of whether the game will decide to keep running or fall over in a heap.

Because of that I cannot recommend it right now and the sour taste this has left means I'll wait for the next console port of a AAA title before going anywhere near it, its simply not worth the hassle or damage to your enjoyment of  a long loved series.

The poor optimization also makes loading screens incredibly long. I don't mean like a couple minute, either. I mean like 10-15 minutes in some areas.

It's like they forgot to program the beginning of the game.  No character development to speak of.  I assume we're supposed to suspend disbelief because of our focus on the TV series or books or something.   Game play is poorly designed.  It looks like an open world, but it's not open at all.  You go through a pre-defined maze of obstacles killing off everyone you run into and it's not clear why.  These people aren't infected.  Not even close to being worth the price.  It doesn't keep me engaged.  It's boring running around killing people.  Perhaps this was programmed by Grand Theft Auto zealots."

My rig is  an Intel 8700, rtx 2080 and 32 mb RAM. This is well within the official ""recommended"" requirements for 1080p 60hz at 'high' settings and the game auto default to high settings and native 1440p. The performance is drastically improved but I played thru the prologue and got about 40-45 fps. I also experimented with DLSS at 'quality' and 'performance' mode and saw a small buff to fps, but not too much. I tried 2160p and 'performance' mode DLSS and got about 30-45 fps. One scene that involved heavy rain during the night TANKED performance and couldn't get anything above 40 fps. Finally, I played thru about half of Bill's chapter with naive 1080p resolution and 'default' AA, whatever that means and got 55-60 stable FPS with a few drops to 50-51. I am not super sensitive to frame drop so this was more than playable for me personally but, I would still much rather have a stable 60 fps especially when I am told by the Dev that my computer can run this game 60fps. My 'benchmarking' was eyeballing the fps counter in the corner of the screen so it is nothing too serious but still, I'm pretty annoyed. 

Oddly, there are a number of visual bugs that definitely weren't present at launch. Joel's eye brows would get very bushy and would flicker. His hair and beard would also get very blocky and Ellie's hair would look like plastic. There was also broken floor textures that would look like matte black.

Unfortunately, I won't be finishing this play through because these just ruin this AMAZING game and my fun. I'll just play it on PS4. I still don't recommend this game on mid range hardware, at least until they fix the visual bugs."

I will say that under the horrible quality of the port that the game is genuinely great and that's why I kept [u]trying[/u] to play the game even with the stupid amount of crashes. There would be times where I wouldn't crash for about 30 mins - 1 hour and was really immersed in the game but then of course it would crash which would throw me out of the immersion then proceed to crash multiple more times quickly after. There was times when I couldn't get through an area due to crashes just not letting me. 

I will say that I haven't finished the game, but I can't see myself actually being able to finish the game with the state it's in. I would suggest not buying this game right now and maybe just wait a year or two until the game is HOPEFULLY patched enough to be stable.

-I do a DDU on my display drivers. Get the latest drivers re-installed via a fresh download. Nope. Game crashes again; however, not before taking longer to crash in an effort to clearly trick me into believing that this game was finally going to load.

- I did a, “Verify integrity of games file.” All this did was trigger the game to build shaders again, and after rebuilding the shaders, it was kind enough to take a little longer before crashing.

Gameplay itself is fair. While I do notice odd visual issues fairly often, they are usually in reflections, or in demanding scenes. During the prologue, my screen freaked out and I had thought my GPU failed. It was a rainbow stream of colors and I've never seen anything like it in any game ever. Genuinely had me scared for a long time. The story is unlike the show, however this game precedes the show by 10 years. Visually the game can look like borderlands, or even gta5 at times. I wouldn't consider this the remaster Sony advertised in the slightest. The performance of this game is absolutely horrendous. My Ryzen 5950X runs at 88C while by GPU runs at 64C, mind you this is high settings. However I have never had any other game, especially one from 10 years ago use all my GPU, and CPU, while creating waste heat the way this game does. I would refund the game if I'm being entirely honest. I watched for hours on twitch before deciding to purchase it as I hadn't encountered any of the issues that were there on launch day. However after the reviews and the way I'm not the only person who has these issues, is a little bit troubling for a game that is again, 10 years old.

I played it only on steam deck so that is going to be the point of view of this review.

Some time ago neil druckmann actually mentioned that the deck would be consider on the port ( https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1601694903724953600?t=yc0YZG93IKw5sBgoiw-ieA&s=19 ) and well... The game is now released, let's see how it turns out...

Turns out ND actually took in consideration the deck or at least on the settings menu and the haptics (when you use the deck instead of another controller it adds a haptics configuration to the settings).

Now on optimization I'm going to say is garbage, I was targeting 40 fps, even 30 fps would be playable, I had everything in low and I tried with fsr and all, even with cryo utilities and it was running at 25 fps.

So, if you really want to feel the cinematic fps experience of the game the deck is your way to go.

I don't doubt that they are going to patch this mess but if neil druckmann says something even on a tweet he better keep the promise next time.

TL; DR: if you want to experience it on deck do not buy yet and wait for patches, it runs like dogshit.

Edit: it seems that update 1.0.4 makes the game more playable at 30fps with some drops, I've been quite enjoying the game but still needs more polish, when you enter into the big building on act 1 the performance still struggles to get to 30 fps so I still can't recommend to buy it yet but give it a try if you have it, is overall more stable than before on steam deck.

Edit 2: Finished the main game and left behind dlc campaign from start to finish on steam deck, I actually enjoyed the game on the deck but sometimes in buildings or heavy action scenes I still found fps drops that were between 20-29fps, I found rare graphic glitches and little artifacting in some places. The game still needs more optimization if it was promised to run on the deck but at least you can play the game from start to finish on the deck if you don't care about occasional frame drops on some parts of the game. Still wait for an update or at least buy it on sale at this state but I suggest you still wait for patches."

It doesn't suffer from ""Stutter"" like a ton of other ports unless you max out the VRAM usage in the settings and I think that's great. However, it crashes randomly on many configurations and the CPU limitations suggest you need a 12900k to compete with the the PS5 and I don't need to explain how insanely silly that is to the veteran PC users that know how strong the hardware is but to everyone else : It's *ridiculous*

Good game but a horrible port; a story I keep hearing more and more since around 2021 started. I remember a time when ports were mostly being praised for a few years for all being well done and taking advantage of the hardware in a PC.. Ah oh well. Go buy Resident Evil 4 instead"

On top of an almost 80 GB install size, the game took nearly 2 hours to compile shaders while at 100% CPU. Heated the room up exponentially. When the shader compilation finished, I started a game and the performance was pretty bad but I thought I'd stick through it since I played the original 10 years ago at 30FPS. CPU was still at 100% after the shader compilation and the fans were going crazy. 10 minutes into the opening scene, my game hitched and crashed right when i got into the truck. This is not the launch I expected out of a Naughty Dog game. Fix your game and care more about PC ports. Many people are switching over to PC and this is not the treatment we deserve. I'm sure I can speak for the majority of players that were excited for this PC port by saying it was beyond disappointing and a frustrating waste of time. 0/10 until they do something about this mess.

Edit: Upon updating my game with the v1.0.1.7 hotfix, I now have to reinstall shaders again. This will most likely take another 2 hours. What is Naughty Dog thinking? I am not going to wait another 2 hours for a hope that the game stops crashing. GET YOUR $H!T TOGETHER AND HIRE PEOPLE TO FIX YOUR MISTAKE.

Edit #2: So I try launching it after their 3rd ""patch"" - v.1.0.2.0. I was met with the infamous shader compilation for the 3rd time (I've been all caught up to date on my drivers) and I decide to go out and take a drive and get some shopping done. I get home about 30 minutes later and it crashed mid shader compile at 22% with a dialogue that said to verify the integrity of the game. I am now on the 4th shader compilation attempt. This is highway robbery, Naughty Dog. You owe your dedicated fans/playerbase an apology and compensation for this unplayable mess.

Edit #3: shaders...after...every.....single.....update.............

Optimize your games before thinking that making a single player game require a 30 minute download of shaders after every single update would be a good idea."

In my few hours of game-time I have not experienced a single real glitch or bug and I haven't crashed a single time, nothing like that. Where the issues are for me is just the performance. The game doesn't stutter much for me, but the frames are very sluggish and the settings I choose don't make a lick of difference. My computer is definitely not top of the line, however it is far from bad and the specs they released prior to release would indicate I should still be able to run the game at a stable fps on decent settings, but this simply is not the case. On top of this, having to wait over an hour for shader's to load simply to play the game semi-smoothly is honestly not acceptable.

The game will be great when they fix it, but right now it seems to be a lottery as to whether your PC will be able to play it (and it's not down to specs).

My system (Laptop - Lenovo Legion 5 15ARH7H):
[list]
    [*]AMD Ryzen 7 6800H
    [*]32gb DDR5 RAM
    [*]RTX 3070 Ti 8gb
[/list]

Now I realise this is a laptop, but it's not ancient, and it has decent specs. The game is unplayable. I expect ""ultra"" to be out of the question due to VRAM usage, but both Medium and High settings are within the limits (according to the games own settings menu) - however with either preset, I get constant crashes. Only playable for 5 mins at a time before a total crash.

When the game works, the performance is acceptable (>60 fps 1080p).

There are also oddities, such as horrendous graphical glitches when you make settings changes and don't restart the game, even though there is no prompt to restart it.

finally, the 1+ hour shader compilation is ridiculous, but i can live with that since it's a one off.

Just be very careful if you choose to by this game on a system that  is on the lower end of the specs as that shader compile can eat into your 2 hour refund time.

I love the Last of Us games, I've played in the past, and i'm sure this can/will be great... eventually. If that is the case, i will update my review.

Until then, there's no way I can recommend the game right now and to be honest, it is a disgrace that the game has been released in this state.

Anyway, I’ve had no issues with the game other than random fps drops. It looks beautiful, I play on ultra settings with a Intel-i9 13900K, 4070ti. I believe this my specs are probably the reason i’m not having as many issues which is a load of FRICK because NaughtyDog advertises the game to be able to be run at way lower specs. Again, shade to you NaughtyDog, do better. 

I do recommend the game. It is a wonderful game with a lot of story and there is nothing that competes with the rich storyline. however, I do not recommend buying the game until it is completely optimized for all the specs they claim to have optimized it for.  That’s why I’m giving this game a thumbs down. I love the story but if you’re going to f$&k people out of a game, at least give them some protection first."

I waited until the first patch because Sony has a track record of poor launches. The wait did me no good. I'll list the good, the annoying, the bad, and the system killing:
THE GOOD
1. Game looks fantastic. This is where most of their effort went, but then again, they did do the re-re-remaster for the PS 5, so how much credit does this team get? 
2. The sound is fantastic.
3. The writing is excellent for the little I will play of this game; more on that later. 
THE ANNOYING
1. Keyboard layout, I am sure you can take the time to remap the keyboard but come on, some actual thought should go into this; I know it is meant to be played with a controller, but this is the PC build people will use a keyboard and mouse. There is no excuse for having the pickup/action button be E and the put-down button be Backspace on the other side of the keyboard.
THE BAD
1. I could go on forever but will boil it down; Call it an hour of playtime. All but 15 minutes of that were the game-building shaders and a loaded scene to the tune of 30 minutes. 
2. Game crashed after all the shaders were built, load scenes loaded, and the military shot the daughters. After all that, the game crashed in the very first scene 20 years later. A hard crash also locked up the entire system; more on that later.  
3. It is a resource hog, this game taxes my system, and I am well over the recommended specs. I have an AMD 5800X3D, RTX 3080ti, the game is installed on a PCI 4.0 NVMe, and I have 64 GBs of DDR4 RAM for poos and giggles. That isn't a brag; that is to point out that my system should have no problem running this game, and yet it does. So unless you have a 40 series GPU, you should wait until they patch this game a few more times. 
THE POSSIBLE SYSTEM BREAKING
1. This game changes lighten profiles for some RGB software environments or at least did with my iCue ecosystem. That's good, but in my case, it also changed my fan curves; whose fault this is Corsair or the game can probably be debated, but I wanted to mention it because thermal throttling/crashing might be a few other people's issues. Not to say that it could damage hardware (it isn't likely, but possible) with your fans running lower and not keeping up with the obviously increased heat output. 
In closing, the game looks fantastic and will run amazingly shortly, but at the time I am writing this (4/2/23) is a different day. If you decide to buy it, you can disable the RGB function in the menu system, and I recommend it unless you are sure it isn't messing with your fan speeds/curves."

Restarted game, hit continue, the gameplay bit immediately after the first cutscene started, game crashed again after roughly 2-3 seconds.

Also, what in the world is being rendered here that would use up all 12gb of VRAM. I know it's not quite so simple, but honestly, there are games that look better than this and don't put much of a strain on a RTX 4070TI at all.

Nice going, guys, well done! I'd slow clap but I'm currently typing away.

 It's strange though - presumably this game was developed on PCs, so you'd think that, at some point during its months and months of development, someone at least accidentally had to have launched the game and noticed that there are some hitches. I know I'm not even close to being the only one who's had issues, so it's not like some obscure thing that could have been missed with even a modest amount of playtesting (if indeed any was even carried out). 

Or maybe every single person who worked on the development of this PC port for who knows how long was just super lucky with their combination of hardware and software/drivers and, entirely by coincidence, they didn't run into any issues and decided this is ready for launch. What are the odds?! The technical wizards at Iron Galaxy should play the lottery with that kind of luck!"

However, the long-awaited PC port of The Last of Us is ESPECIALLY awful. I'd compare it to the disaster that was Cyberpunk, but at least that game wasn't literally unplayable at launch. 

It took four hours, over a dozen crashes, and nearly 100% of my entire CPU usage for the shaders to install, which is unacceptable to say the least. However, when I finally get to play the game, I wake up, I walk downstairs and wouldn't you know, the game crashes yet again, telling me to verify the integrity of the files. Not realising that this would lead to me sitting through the shader installation again, I did. After about 7 HOURS of similar problems, I finally got to play the game properly... well, that is when it wasn't crashing literally every 20 minutes. On medium graphics. 

It's not like it's even a hardware issue. While my PC isn't 100% top-of-the-line to today's standards, it's still decent, with it being able to run similar games on way higher graphics settings. Games like Uncharted, the other Naughty Dog game ported from the PS5 to the PC. So how did they fuck up the port this badly? Why can I barely run the remake of a PS4 remake of a PS3 game?

The only reason I didn't refund and persevered for as long as I did was because I knew that underneath it all, there was an amazing game waiting to be experienced... but even then I felt a bit let down. Don't get me wrong, this game is really good - definitely one of Sony's better titles. But I don't know if it was a combination of the technical difficulties eviscerating my hype, being spoiled over time, and a decade of people constantly hyping up the game to make it sound like it would cure cancer and bring about world peace with how good it supposedly is, but I wasn't really feeling it as much as I would've hoped.

Although somewhat overrated, this game is worth your time and money, and when the technical difficulties are fixed I'll change my review. But as it stands now, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Don't give Sony your money for a fundamentally broken product. And fuck Iron Galaxy."

Therefore, I have a view that I am prepared to receive clown awards for; The Last of Us is an objectively good game – but one that I subjectively did not enjoy – and one that is most definitely overrated from the genre-defining masterpiece I had heard it to be. This review contains minor spoilers.

Story

When looking at the story directly, I simply can’t help but compare it to the HBO adaptation of which I preferred in every single way. TLOU’s game story feels less powerful and less emotional with little depth and development of characters and storylines, along with like-for-like scenes simply being done better in the show. The general plot is the same though, and it certainly is a good one with adequate pacing and time skips that hit harder as you can only assume the way a chapter concluded. The finale is a morale choice that is not black or white with Joel being a great example of flawed human character who must make an impossible decision. Voice acting is great along with character lip-syncing – which is important as a lot of scenes contain only dialogue as music felt very rare. Given the age of this game, I’m not going to go over exact parts, but generally the story is engaging and varied enough to be the sole reason you would play it. It is a good story. I don’t know if I could stretch it to be more than that.

Gameplay

Whilst I recognise Part 1 is a remaster of a remaster of a 2013 last last gen video game, gameplay wise it holds up. I loved the way your character moves in combat – especially when running through infected – rather than them getting near you and instantly attacking, their attacks felt fair, and it is possible to weave in and out of their paths in a way many games simply do not allow you to. The human enemies smartly flanked and called out their intentions to allies, with general combat difficulty and encounters appearing well crafted and balanced. Movement is generally dynamic, and the flexibility of crafting was well done, along with the upgrade system of your character stats or your weapons at a workbench through items collected in the game world. Having to watch every single weapon upgrade animation – some of which were literally just Joel rubbing the gun with a cloth – got quickly annoying though. I enjoyed scavenging for supplies, but the gameplay sandbox simply never demanded enough of me to use most of them – so I was almost always full on what I had crafted and how much I could store. Shooting was setting-accurate but frustrating to engage with, yet I got through it as it was simply the most efficient way of playing as stealth just wasn’t worth the effort due to the soft cover system being too finicky. The game had a fair balance between combat and puzzle / traversal sections, though I would have liked to see just something else to vary things up; there was no side content outside of collectibles for the sake of achievements.

Left Behind

The prequel chapter was something again that I played after watching the show’s version first, and once again I preferred the show. As something included with this edition, it was a good side story and did give provide further depth to Ellie’s past. Like the main game though, it just left me underwhelmed as it was a short and simple experience that didn’t offer anything different than what I had already played. The split between past and present honestly ruined a lot of the narrative strength this could have had, and I think it would have done better being one longer story set with Ellie and Riley exclusively – just like the show.

Graphics and Performance

The game looks good for one that is originally based off a PS3 title, and it holds up well even now in 2023. The variety of graphics settings were shocking – so much so that I just set a preset and was happy enough with that. At launch, right now, the game has been negatively reviewed due to the quality of Iron Galaxy’s port. I do not believe it is as bad as the Internet narrative has shown; we know that games are getting more VRAM intensive, and it’s clear that many people simply do not understand the right settings to use for their system. In my experience, outside of numerous crashes, the port ran well on high settings with the only real negative being occasional stutters (yes, I did wait for shaders to compile). There are obviously areas where this port can be improved, but so long as you are reasonable, it’s a perfectly playable experience.

Overall

My conclusion here is the same as what I said initially: The Last of Us is a good game, but not much more. It does everything well enough but did nothing great enough to truly be of note. To me, this title is massively overrated from what I had expected it to be; whilst others may enjoy it, I simply cannot recommend it. Maybe I will just fall into the minority group of people who prefers Part II…"
3126,3,0.3543,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make",The stuttering in this game is so bad. It's almost impossible playing on keyboard and mouse. I found it stutters less when you use a controller. Changing graphical settings makes no difference. I have a 3080 Trinity with 24 gigs of VRAM and running this at 1080p/1440/4K it's all hovering between 30-80FPS. The drops are terrible as well. Having played this game on PS5 several times it's not something that ruins the experience for me. But I cant imagine being a first time player to this on PC and having to deal with these problems. How Naughty Dog let this get released without checking it first is beyond me.

Played this game on the PS3 and while consoles are OK I grew up using a mouse and keyboard.  That and of course the ability to upgrade hardware for better performance should make this this best version of The Last of Us right?  Fun fact: the PC version has a unique feature that will let you know when you have been playing too long.  It will automatically just crash to the desktop usually when you are in the middle of an important encounter.  All in all I was able to make it through the game and in a way the constant crashing has its benefits.  Instead of hitting esc and selecting exit to desktop it really just takes no effort to let it crash out. It tends to take a little longer to fully crash but no effort on my part.  I bet the game has decided I was done playing more than I decided I was done playing by a factor of 10.  Can't wait for them to port over Part II!"

Why not delay it for another week/month? Considering this game is 20-30 hours worth of gameplay MAX, it's even more important that you get it right the first time around.

You say it plays like ♥♥♥♥, I say it's smooth like butter. We're not the same.

Loading up the first time, waited for shader decompiling to finish, changed settings to high (was ultra by default) & used DLSS at 4K. This game has a slew of settings to tweak, take that into consideration. Rebooted it, then started playing + streaming for about 2hrs. NO CRASHES, I repeat, NO CRASHES.

7950x/3080Ti ; It plays like butter

Also take the <1hr playtime reviews with a large grain of salt. Especially when some have sub-par hardware as well. I understand there's also people with high end rigs that have the same prob but give the game a break. IT JUST RELEASED A DAY AGO.

Thank you Naughty Dog, you didn't have to give us this game but am thankful for it. To be refreshed with higher fidelity is a god send for anyone who's been a fan since its original PS3 debut. Will continue to enjoy this treat & anything else ya'll improve will just be the icing on top. Happy gaming peeps

My repsonse to this review was
I'm glad you're able to play the game, however saying ""IT JUST RELEASED A DAY AGO."" is a very terrible when you are spending so much money on a game. It's quite a harmful mentality to have for products in general but especially gaming.
Something you paid for should work. Bug can exist but the game should be playable start to finish at the bare minimum.
Defending a company releasing a badly coded game because it just released is a bad opinion and anti consumer and they double down on this bad opinion"

3.

what is naughty dog thinking. just scamming ppl. the person who did this maths of VRAM requirements should be fired from the spot. Common its a PC, 1 GB VRAM will always be taken by OS + Apps. how can they make such a bad maths mistake.

Its clear that Naughty Dog n Sony has made it up their agenda of offering bad PC ports to make PC community feel that PC is bad and PlayStation is good. This makes me shit on PS5 more and more.

So onto game play, the game frequently crashes before you even to the title menu, once you get there it frequently crashes when loading your saved game.  Once you’re in the game it frequently crashes when crafting an item or at random times.

I’ve been looking forward to this game for years, and this has ruined my experience of it.  I’m getting 5-6 crashes each hour.

3190,0,0.3254,"story, last, also, character, gameplay, feel, instead, present, hype, find","TL;DR: I am torn, because the game in and of itself is a refresh of a masterpiece, but its launch was absolutely horrendous on PC, and can't blame anyone who gives it a negative review. Let's get to it.
EDIT: I'm changing my review to negative until the performance issues get fixed. No amount of good story and gameplay should be held back by a horrible port.

I first played the remaster of the original on a borrowed PS4, so I knew this one was a good one beforehand. What I wasn't expecting was the myriad of problems the game had/has at launch.

From the beginning, I spent nearly the entire refund period just trying to last longer than a few seconds in the main menu while precompiling shaders without crashing the game. I would watch the performance tab on my PC to see RAM usage peaking at about 28GB before crashing, which is insane.

Nearly an hour later, I managed to launch the game, only to find abhorrent performance; almost impossible to reach 60fps even at 1080p on my 2080 Super, with horrible stutters and jittery camera movement. That same day I found a few possible fixes and tweaked the settings, which let me bump up the resolution to 1440p (w/DLSS) with possible crashes, or 1080p at nearly rock solid 60.... until it doesn't anymore. What I've found is that the game is heavily CPU limited, to the point where even a 12core 24thread CPU (Ryzen 3900x) gets capped to even 30FPS at times because of streaming data. I would understand if this happened because I'm running it on an old HDD, but I have it installed on a 3500mb/s NVME drive...

Outside of that, I didn't find any game breaking bugs as others have, so I don't have any comments regarding that situation.

So... what's left is the gameplay, graphics and the story.

Graphics are, as expected, superb. The engine rework is worth just based off the face animations alone, the rest is a huge cherry on top, with material rendering that makes every element in the scenery feel grounded, which is sadly still not easy to accomplish. Animations are reworked as well, based off Part 2 (which I hope lands sometime soon). This on top of excellent sound really do make sense in terms of just BEING, it basically revitalized the franchise so as to have a level of graphical consistency with Part 2.

Gameplay is excellent, if not a bit antiquated. You see, the gunplay is excellent, and the AI and level design allows for a very quick change of pace; slow and methodical, slow and stealthy, balls to the wall, or extreme aggression, and that makes combat REALLY fun. However, level design pretty much delineates just how combat is going to pan out to the point where I found myself saying out loud; there's a shootout incoming, and I know there will be at least 3 alternate paths. At the same time, the ""puzzles"" are nothing more than an annoyance, and wish they at least had varied them a bit more for this remaster. 

Story is ultimately what drove this one to excellence and what prompted the series IMO. The search for meaning of a broken, silent and lonely man with a girl who fears being alone and loves to talk takes for a great dynamic, which is expertly exploited all throughout the 20 or so hours it may take you to finish the game.

I will most likely play the DLC later on, but my review still stands. Were it not for the amount of issues it has/had at launch, this would have probably been an ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviewed game, but as it stands, I think it deserves the negative criticism."

After installing shaders I attempted 3 launches all crashing within 5 minutes of playtime (Adjusting settings made no difference). Alongside it's strange that I was seeing the PC key-bind HUD overlay on in-game objects when I'm playing on an Xbox controller. The problem isn't people playing the game prior to finishing the shader build process, the problem is the game was optimized by a company who has a track record of poor optimization. If you attempt to run it make sure you to keep your playtime under 2 hours (that way you can get a refund). Good luck."

It has soooo many visual glitches, like the met eyebrows glitch, missing textures and textures just not loading in. 
There are a lot of physics glitches which make parts of the game unplayable until you do a restart. 
There are sound glitches where the sound goes all static and horrible till restart occurs.
When first starting up the game you have to wait like an hour for the textures to compile.
It is really un optimized and has lots of lag spikes... Like I will play at like 50-60 fps and then every 30 seconds this deadly 1 fps drop which happens at the worst times like sneaking behind a clicker or something.
Yea, kinda burns cause I have always wanted to play this game and this was my first opportunity to play it... I pre ordered because I was so excited. But no, just no. Valve, please fix, I mean naughtydog.

UPDATE:
So the FPS is getting better and the glitches are lessening a little. Still have bad FPS occasionally and textures breaking after a couple hours of gameplay and the occasional major stutter and the occasional straight crash. Nearly gone through my first playthrough of the campaign now so that is good on the bright side. It has only taken me months to get to Tommy in real time because of how stressful the game can be when it is just not working. But with every second update or so I do see some improvement. Keep it up Naughtydog, not perfect, but you are getting there and I am sure I will be able to complete the game soonish. 

ANOTHER EDIT:
After some hard hours and determination I finally completed the main campaign.

In light of having a few more hours under my belt, I wanted to update my original remarks.

None of the following points contain explicit spoilers, but I do mention character names and traits. You have been warned. :)

THE GOOD:
- The game is indeed gorgeous on the PC. The light shafts, the dust, the shadows...it's definitely immersive. Sound design is similarly great.

- The interplay between Joel and Ellie is interesting, especially during the quiet moments.

- Given the more-then-usual difficulty of the game, the checkpoint system is pretty fair, often depositing you very close to the point where you died (and you WILL die).

- There are a couple good twists (but also a couple horrible ones).

THE NOTE-SO-GOOD:
- CPU utilization still seems high, though not as high as before. Shader compilation after a driver update takes LONG time...up to fifteen minutes. The consequences of skipping that process are not clear.

- Joel is often a jerk, as are many of the people you encounter. I get that he's been through unimaginable troubles, but this is a game, after all. Traits I would understand and accept in a real human are sometimes annoying and grating in a game character.

- This isn't necessarily a universal point against the game, but please be sure you understand both the pace of this game and its core gameplay motif. This is a contemplative zombie shooter. If you don't like zombies, pass. If you like lots of continual action, pass.

THE HORRIBLE:
- I hated the ridiculous add-on Left Behind. Ellie and Riley's ""story"" is a story only in the strictest sense of the word. In reality, it was a transparent attempt to wring some pathos out of a friendship we already knew was doomed, with a touch of sociopolitical agendatainment thrown in, because that's what media creators do now. Hard pass on that garbage. I wish I'd just cut my losses, finished the main campaign, uninstalled, and never looked back.

BOTTOM LINE:
- The word ""classic"" occurred to me many times during my play through, but ironically...because so many people say this game is a classic but ""saying it don't make it so."" After finishing the main story and beginning the add-on campaign, I have to sadly assert that this game succeeds only at making me depressed and angry.

I will grudgingly admit (grudgingly because of all the technical frustrations I encountered and because of some of the poor writing) that I did enjoy the slower beats. It's actually fun to explore abandoned towns and similar areas, looking for scraps and upgrade fodder. Those quiet moments also allow the player to get to know the heroes better. The combat, however, is clunky and difficult, even at the easy settings. If you choose to fight often (instead of using stealth) you will also choose to die often. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, and some of the hidden stuff is TOO well hidden. I'm not sure this is a game I'll want to replay in order to scoop up anything I missed.

- I'm grateful to be able to play the game at all, from a technical perspective. Read that again. The game industry MUST enforce better accountability when games are released in the state this game was released. I bought a product that was almost instantly unplayable. Where is my remedy? Any acknowledgement would be appreciated: a coupon, a bit of free DLC, even an explicit apology. Instead, I shelled out a lot of money to...wait. Wait for an explanation; wait for a patch, never knowing a timeline or the actual cause of the problems. Very frustrating and non-customer-centric.

- If you loved the original, you'll probably want to play it again...just know that you may experience residual technical issues on the way to enjoying the gorgeous visuals. If you've never played this game, go in with the understanding that this isn't Call of Duty or anything like it, and you may feel deep disappointment and even betrayal at some of the story choices.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

This is an early review after about 90 minutes of playtime, after which the game crashed over and over and wouldn't allow me to progress. Technologically, this game is an absolute piece of malware garbage. The shader compilation took FOREVER...I'm not even sure it was finished by the time I started playing.

The CPU vs. GPU usage is completely out of whack...the game seems to depend on the CPU for an inordinate amount of rendering. And then, of course, there's the story and the characters, which I can sum up with two words: depressing and unlikable, respectively. And, mild spoiler, if you do end up liking a character, there's a pretty good chance he/she will die. Horrible waste of money; unbelievably over-hyped.

Plus, I'll also throw in the Covid comparison. This game is infinitely more upsetting after having lived through the last few years, when we all got a tiny taste of how unprepared society is for a global health crisis. This kind of bleak scenario is no longer pure fantasy. Some people really do devolve into horrible versions of themselves when faced with disaster.

Bottom line: if you remember this game from your PS4, you'll probably want to replay it. If you've never played it, run like the wind. There are SO many better new games out there, such as Dead Space and Forspoken. In my opinion, this isn't worth your time, either from a technical or storytelling standpoint."

Visually the game looks good. 

Stability/optimization if you're playing a GPU with 16GB+ Vram it works pretty good with no FPS drops or anything, but that's an IF  condition at the moment of writing the review.

Story is good, but it's not that perfect thing Sony fans tried to make it up to be. Good =/= Perfect

Gameplay, even if this is a very remastered and 2023ed game, the gameplay is FUNish, but it's a bit shallow version of the 2013 tomb Raider, without the cool climbing mechanics. 

The bad.

Even if we had loads of fun and making fun of it on stream, the load times are a huge minus for people who wanna play the game for themselves and enjoyment. Randomly 2-10 min load screens cause why not? RE4 Remake had 0 at max settings + RT, cmon man...

For streamers, turn off Real time reflection and set your streaming program to above medium priority or it will be causing huge issues to your stream.

Even if I exprience 0 crashes, which is mostly cause the 6800xt is 16GB, I've seen and read a lot of people with 12GB Vram and less having constant crashing and issues, which is not normal.



Overall, Good game, not perfect, but good! Horrible port. Fun to troll around on stream, unpleasand experience to play for enjoyment."

First, be warned - this is not the ORIGINAL Last of Us (Part 1), it is the remastered version, which in my opinion ruined the weapon and vitamin upgrade mechanics. The title should have listed it as the remastered version. Like I said, this is my personal opinion, which most players won't care about, but I thought why not mention it in case anyone else is picky about this too. 

Secondly, I too ran into shaders problem everyone else has. I chose the suggested solution to disconnect from the internet and it did go much faster (only took about 30 minutes total).

Lastly, and most importantly, are the games crashes. From the beginning to the part where Joel and Ellie meet Henry and Sam (where I stopped for the day) the game crashed over twenty five times, sometimes 3 times in quick succession. The good news is, I didn't lose much progress each time. The bad news is, how long it takes to reload each time. Hence I spent a day of reload after reload instead of actual game play. At least that is what it felt like. 

Very disappointing as it is now. Save your money until it's fixed.

UPDATE:
Installed all updates as of 4/9/23, including updating graphics driver as recommended for my Navidia Geoforce RTX 3080 computer.
Also, used another player's suggestions to turn off V sync and lock FPS at 70. 
     
Results were:
Shaders still took 30+ minutes to load even though I did as last time and had my internet turned off.
Load times are better, but still takes longer than it should.
A crash-free game for 4 hours, whereas before I would have crashed at least once an hour.
However, GPU still ran hard, though not as bad as before, so I did not play as long as I wanted, in order to protect my computer. 
There is now a weird look to graphics. It's hard to explain, but I can see texture of what's being displayed, mostly for larger areas of same color (like seeing the brush strokes of a painting). It was very noticeable at first, but I guess my eyes adjusted and I stopped seeing it as I continued to play.

So, while there is improvement, more needs to be done in my opinion. Older gaming computers will probably still have severe problems running this game.

So, my recommendation will remain negative.

Update 2:
32+ hours playtime now and nothing has changed regarding performance. Game continues to make my computer run so hard that after a few hours it crashes (always at a cut scene). I have completed the game and the DLC but the struggles to do so made this game a complete waste of my time and money. Another update is out of course, but these updates take so much of my computer memory, I'll probably uninstall the game and go back to replaying a favorite like Prey, Stardew Valley, Maid of Sker, or Resident Evil Village."

And I am not a person who actually writes reviews.
This is one of the best games ever made, but the port of this game is a complete disaster.

I can see through the long shader buidling waiting time. It was annoying to wait like 45 minutes.
But, at least the game ran with a hick up here and there until it crashed when I took control over Joel in the opening scene.

Well, after each crash I can not restart the game anymore without rebooting my whole pc first.
Also here, rebooting my computer just takes a minute so, sure why not. Let's try again.

But now, if I even load into the game the fun part begins.
As soon as I press on continue, the game crashes to the desktop.

I think it is a very negative trend that so many companies release games with so much issues these days, but this is quite extreme in my opinion. I have not encountered many of the problems mentioned by others, simply because I was not able to get as far to run into them in the first place.

That is pretty sad.

3259,0,0.2681,"story, last, also, character, gameplay, feel, instead, present, hype, find","Let me start by saying that I did not play the original game, and haven't watched the show yet. With that being said, I am completely intrigued by the story and the world building. The visuals are completely breath taking and keep me coming back for more.
A few hours into the story, I feel so overwhelmed with the game's atmosphere that I find myself actually terrified and shocked at times. I've found myself sitting on the edge of my seat at points, and I've grown to really care about the characters. Overall, I am completely enamored with this title and so thankful it finally made its way to PC. Unfortunately, that's where my praise ends.
This port is obviously based on a gem of a game, however, I am quite disappointed that my introduction to this franchise is mired by technical issues, including a seemingly never ending shader cache, poor optimization, and insane load times. Let me address each of these issues in more detail.

1. Shaders: I opened and closed this game around 30 times in an attempt to build the shader cache, let it sit over night with no progress, and eventually gave up. I've made it through an awful lot of the story at this point, all the while wondering if the visual experience (which can be truly breathtaking) has been altered or impaired by the lack of a complete shader cache. I frequently find myself blown away by the visuals in this title, but I am always wondering if it could have looked a bit better or if I could have gotten a few more frames.

2. Optimization: I like to think that with an R7 5800X, 32GB DDR5 RAM, RX 7900 XT, 1TB M.2 PCIe Gen 4 SSD, 12TB of HDD storage and a tiered caching software solution, I have a fairly high-end PC. In my humble opinion, I should have no issue getting a solid 90-120fps in a game like this. I DO NOT. This game is stored on my SSD to give it every opportunity to really shine, but it simply doesn't perform well. On Ultra settings, with AMD FSR 2.0 set to quality (I would prefer an FSR 2.1 or 2.2 implementation as 2.0 leaves something to be desired and causes trailing artifacts that detract from the otherwise gorgeous visuals, but I haven't found these options in any menu), this game barely keeps an average 60fps with the occasional dip into the high 40's. Obviously, this port needs a few more optimization passes!

3. Load Times: I cannot speak to the load times on the original title as I never played it. I do not own a PlayStation, but I understand they rely greatly on texture streaming. I can see an argument for hardware differences between the SSD in a PlayStation and a PC hard disk being to blame for the downright atrocious load times. However, I have the game stored on a Gen 4 M.2 SSD, and use tiered caching to vastly accelerate read speeds on my storage media. This is done by caching both 6TB HDD in a RAID array to a large chunk of my SSD (L2 Cache), and caching SSD data to 8GB of RAM (L1 Cache). Even with a cache hit rate around 90%, my load times from the main menu to the in-game world are measured in MINUTES, not seconds! After several minutes of staring at a loading screen, I wouldn't expect to have anymore issues, but between each ""level"" I still see ""Please Wait"" while the game attempts to load the next area/region. I say ""attempt""; around half the time I see a loading screen, the loading process clearly times out and the loading screen never disappears, requiring me to close and re-open the application. For a story driven, and highly immersive game, this is gut wrenching. It reminds me of watching a crummy Netflix series and getting to the end of an episode only to be left with a cliffhanger, except with far more frustration.

All in all, The Last of Us Part 1 is fantastic game that was poorly ported and needs a lot of work. At this time, I can't recommend spending $60 USD on this title. Hopefully, the dev team continues to patch the game and get it across the finish line. If they do, and the performance issues are solved, I will gladly update this review. Until that time, you'd have a better experience watching a Let's Play on YT."

I genuinely don't understand how Naughty Dog and Sony even looked at dumpster fire of a PC port and thought to themselves ""Ah, yes, it's perfect, boys its time to release!"". My PC isn't really carrying the bleeding edge of technology when it comes to running games at a perfect 60-120 FPS every second a game is running, BUT my PC is just as capable as any other high-end set up when it comes running games that are graphically demanding like RDR2, CP2077, etc. 

Pardon my french but HOW do you fuck up a PC port this badly??? ND had like more than several months to get this ready for consumers, and yet they couldn't optimize this dogshit of a game before launch?? 
First of all, it should NEVER be taking this much of my VRAM to begin with in the first place. 
To play this at high graphics already made it push beyond my VRAM limits, actually insane. 
Luckily as of this recent patched version at the time of writing this, It's lil less laggy, and is kinda playable??
BUT still, after around 20-30 mins of playing, it already froze and crashed on my PC. 
Also, I had to wait 4-5 hours for this game to finish building Shaders so I had to keep the game running while I slept 
in order for it to be done with that. 
I honestly just don't get why it lags at like 25 FPS at HIGH graphics, when I can run RDR2 at like Ultra graphics with a near constant 60 FPS?

The game functions well graphically speaking as well as the game mechanics themselves, no issues with NPCs, crafting, UI, etc. It's a great game at heart, it's just REALLY REALLY unoptimized and badly performing. 

But hey, at least this current version of the game doesn't have Tess T-Posing in the fucking air compared to when it first released.

Honestly, if you want to buy this game, PLEASE I highly recommend that you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME until ND has fixed all the issues that should've existed in the first place. Wait like maybe 5 months? Maybe 5 more?? Who knows cuz at this point Naughty Dog's Support Team are scrambling like headless chickens to get all these issues fixed."

Played on Arch Linux and Fedora with these launch options:
[code]DXVK_NVAPI_DRIVER_VERSION=53179 %command%[/code]
Proton Experimental is recommended if you want to use DLSS.
Medium settings and FSR Quality.
[strike]Zero crashes so far, but the CPU usage (around 98%) just by decompressing assets is insane, resulting in bad stutter. Can be partially resolved on Linux by using different CPU scheduler like EEVDF, but you will be CPU limited anyway.[/strike] Fixed by v1.0.5 patch, only experienced one crash
[strike]VRAM usage is also bad, just changing textures to medium will eat my entire VRAM.[/strike] Fixed by v1.0.5 patch

[strike]EDIT: If you want to prevent this game hammering your CPU just by decompressing assets, then you can try faking your CPU topology on Proton with this command:
[code]WINE_CPU_TOPOLOGY=6:2,3,4,5,6,7 %command%[/code]
You can change it to any amount and specific threads you want. Everyone's CPU is different, so I can't say which threads are best for you.
This will of course lower your performance, but it's better to have CPU usage under 80% than 98% all time and have unusable system.[/strike] Insane CPU usage is fixed by v1.0.5 patch
[b][strike]EDIT (5/10/2023): v1.0.5 patch fixed most of the issues. It's still not perfect but it's finally playable. On the Steam Deck you need to increase swap (CryoUtilites can take care of it easily) to prevent crashes.

Gonna change my review:

Last of US is the new Crysis.
======================

No crashes. Frame rate varies from 80 to 140. avg 110. during cutscenes, during gameplay much lower around 60~80fps. CPU on 80% load on all cores. GPU draws 180w of power and stays 43 degrees celsius cool. first 30 minutes in no crashes or glitches

my system:
r7 5700g
rtx 4070ti
32gb memory
run the game at high settings.

I do have qualms about borderless windowed, this jeapardizes mouse movement. days gone supports fullscreen, why doesn't uncharted and last of us. we must demand fullscreen. borderless windowed is ass."

3317,1,0.391,"run, setting, pc, fps, performance, port, even, low, still, well","6 hours in and here's how its gone for me running a 10700 with an RTX 3060ti:

1st, the forkin' shaders took a solid hour to finish caching.  Absolutely no reason for it to be this bad. I appreciate letting them compile before starting the game, but an hour to get it done is absolutely ridiculous.

Once I got in game, I seem to be able to hold a solid 50fps if I set my max frames. Its not ideal, but its mostly smooth at that point.  Some random drops and hitched that seem to be coming from enemies being spawned into the game world.  Also get a bit of stutter when transitioning from brightly lit areas to dim, but nothing too bad.

My biggest gripe, besides a few CTD's, is the texture loading.  I have the game installed on a 7300MB/s SSD, and I see constant pop in or just low res assets being loaded with no high res textures in site.  This seems to affect items at random as replays of any particular section will have textures at their reduced quality in one run, with different items popping up with reduced textures in a replay of the section.  The most obvious example of this was when I came through a door, and the brick wall on one side of the door was full res, with the texture on the other side being very low res.  It was the same brick wall.  Just on opposite sides of a doorway. Waiting to see if they'll load seems to have no affect.

As other have pointed out, the VRAM usage is way higher than it should be for what we're seeing.  CPU usage is also way too high.  Expect to have both chugging along nearly maxed out at all times.  The bonus here is that it's cold outside where I am, and the extra heat my rig is throwing off is keeping my house nice and toasty.

You should definitely expect to be running with DLSS (or whatever equivalent you may be able to run) active from the outset.  Without it running I was having issues even hitting 30fps.  With, I can hold the aforementioned 50fps.

I can forgive a twenty minute shader compile time if it eliminates stuttering; the problem is it doesn't. Not so much framerate but frametimes are all over the countryside. The game looks over-sharpened and has a hard contrast look even with the sharpening set to zero. There are numerous small bugs I've noticed despite not playing past the prologue which I've seen several times while trying to fix the issues with the game. I'm not going further until I decide whether to refund.  
There is no exclusive fullscreen and the game runs in a borderless window. Borderless windows are always a bit janky but while you can get away with it with RTS and strategy games, less so when you need smooth movement. Turning on motion blur does hide some of the frametime issues but it a poor substitute for a smooth framerate. I'm running 5950X and a 4090 so I'd suggest if you're on lesser hardware hold off until it's fixed.  
Horizon Zero Dawn launched in a worse state and eventually they fixed it and I'm hoping this will be a similar story. It's worth mentioning the game also comes with a slather of spyware that you can't turn off; only select less or more. As is, hard to recommend; a poor port to cash in the game's good reputation.

My stable PC even bluescreen during shader optimization at one point.
Eventually it got past shader optimization.

Keyboard/mouse control rebinds have a variety of impactful issues.
The Weapon Cross(represented on a controller as the digital keypad), uses the keyboard's arrow keys, and you cannot move the weapon-cross keys elsewhere. The result: If you rebind your WASD movement to the arrow keys, you simultaneously start switching weapons as you move around the world.  Only 3rd-party keymapping programs can fix this.

Certain functions stop working at all when remapped to Numpad keys(Numlock on), like switching to your melee weapon on backpack, scanning for items, scanning for enemies.

Some of the multi-use buttons make sense on PS controller when there are a limited number of buttons, but on the PC, combining Reload/Quick Throw/Use or Weapon Swap/Listen does not make sense, and is awkward.  Fumbling around to find a key in a non-standard location is frustrating.  Another game that DOES do controller-versus-keyboard keybindings well is Call of Duty, seperating or combining functions for keyboard rebindings.

When the game does run, keybindings aside, it runs great.

First of all here's the positives, the game is a technological marvel in terms of graphical fidelity and sound design, Gustavo Santaolalla has done a phenomenal job with the OST, and the acting performances are stellar.
And that's about it.

[b] GAMEPLAY: [/b]
The overall game design is middling at best, and monotonous at worse, I don't mind slow paced games, many slow paced games are my favourite, but it's really boring in the sense that aside from combat encounters, the majority of the game is walking whilst mindlessly spamming the pickup button, moving a ladder or garbage cart, and to keep things fresh.....move a wooden plank when getting through a water level. It lacks the sophistication of traversal or puzzle solving in a game like Re4 or Re2 where each location is interconnected with one another forcing the player to create a mental map, where each item or tool you find is unique to one another and rewarding in terms of progression. As for the combat, it's serviceable, some quality of life improvements have been made to make it feel a tad bit more fun, but it's still void of any depth when it comes to human enemies, in regards to Clickers it tries to make things interesting(isn't rlly) by incentivizing you to crouch past slowly with the help of hearing button(making the monotony even worse), or use craft-able shivs, the bloaters are just clickers on drugs that shoot projectiles and that's about it, also worth noting that your first encounter with a bloater is a 1:1 ripoff the Dead Space 2 train segment where you're stuck hanging upside down, but without the build up that made that segment earned. It really doesn't help that the intro of the game takes 2 hours to start, ya know, being a game. The enemy encounters are placed so predictably, & there's no overall change to the layouts of encounters like something in DOOM for i.e, and there's very little level variety. Speaking of which, most of where you go next is not that different from where you were before, there's only one chapter in the game where there's a change of environment in a fresh way. I don't think I've read a single review that mentions this jarring flaw. And it's not that ND doesn't know these are factors of what make their games, heck an ex-ND employee literally mentioned the their games are focus tested to hell, if there's ever a segment that requires the player to use less than half a brain cell, they'll immediately simplify. I don't think that's inherently bad, but it's a problem when it's like this for the overwhelming majority of the game. Perhaps TloU would be a better game if the countless times you move from one building to another is at least cut short to focus on the combat, or if the buildings themselves were made to be engaging labyrinths. But hey maybe ppl like this. Oh and I must not forget, there's an inventory/skill upgrade system that's there to just exist I guess. There's 0 managing of survival items you find throughout the game, there's little decision making required in terms of the skill tree too, the weapon upgrades at least look cool I guess.

[b] STORY: [/b]
And so going back to that point where I mentioned that Dead Space 2 segment, this is a big problem with TLOU, it copies other pieces of media without understanding why certain things happen in other games & movies, and so I'm puzzled by the crazy extent of critical acclaim this game received as an ""achievement in video game story telling"", nothing regarding the narrative is reflected in the gameplay, and the gameplay itself is doing nothing special and isn't even executing it better than it's contemporaries even at the time of 2013. And in regards to the story, there's nothing stellar about it, as it's a blatant ripoff of Children of Men, with a bit of it mimicking Y The Last Man, but with the post apocalyptic backdrop of fungal zombies(so that it at least looks a bit different when it's borrowing TWD's plot points). Now there's nothing wrong with taking inspiration from several places, the issue I have is that nothing I'm experiencing here is unique, it's an amalgamation of the media it's remixing. A lot of things happen in the story because, well the writers want it to happen, rarely has anything happened organically in the story, and sometimes that can cause plot points to feel rather disjoint, for example in the intro where [spoiler] Joel reaches a check point, a soldier is ordered to gun him & Sarah down. Why? What's the point of the checkpoint if you're gonna shoot 2 helpless ppl? [/spoiler] Cuz calamity struck & humans bad 🗿? Seriously how cheap and derivative, I love it when films show more and tell less, but this fil- I mean game isn't even showing. You'll find numerous examples like this throughout the campaign. And what was depicted in that scene is kinda what bothers me, the game has not much else to say aside from the father daughter aspect that humans are just as worse as the zombies when calamity strikes, there's this misanthropic air throughout the entire story, which shows a clear miss-understanding of the story it's copying, in-fact I find it kind of disrespectful to Children of Men as that film's iconic long shot through [spoiler] the hospital building(which TloU also aimed to mimic) [/spoiler] was a scene intent to show that deep down inside humans are actually loving and selfless, and that they're not inherently hateful and violent, they're driven to be made that way via bad politics. Just recently the devastating earthquakes in Syria & Turkey for example, people dropped whatever they were doing and rushed to save as many of each other as possible, they were more loving towards one another than they were in their everyday normal lives. You won't see that in TloU, you'll see people eat each other apart, or make factions where everyone's a fascist. And yet Niel Druckmann claims that TloU is a study on the human condition and that it has something important to say. You can see how far up his own a** he has to be to say than, when 1. this is not how humans are, this is a POV presented in a psychology book by Le Bon in 1895 that every world leader during WW2 loved, Hitler, even Mussolini, the idea that humans are ready to erupt into anarchy whenever things go wrong, a concept that has been proven wrong multiple times throughout history.
2ndly, most of the game's story beats don't even come from a human place, they come from, well, other stories, like oh jee I bet nobody saw [spoiler] them cannibals [/spoiler] coming.

The some of the characters other than Joel & Ellie are often just literary devices to provide trauma fuel, rather than being actual people. And when it's not borrowing from other media, you get a contrived moral dilemma near the end that is too vague and unexplored to properly be called a dilemma and is an very dehumanising analogy for the 2011 freeing of an IDF soldier in exchange for some Palestinian. So basically Neil asked his dad what he thinks about the situation, his dad says this it's bad for their country, but he'd do it for his son, dawwh that's kinda touching isn't it, & what's gross about it is that it's very dehumanising in the sense that [spoiler] Joel saving a kid he's attached to at the cost of no cure for humanity, leaving zombies out & about, is akin to letting some Palestinians go home and be out and about [/spoiler]. On the surface it's a story about the love between a father & child (Just like The Road directed by John Hillcoat💀), but upon close inspection it's misanthropy disguised as a study on the human condition. Wrapped inside a game that shines due to it's polish rather than craftsmanship.



Thank you for reading as I've poured my heart into this review, for those that love TLOU, I'm glad it brought goodness to your lives."
3381,3,0.3062,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","TLDR: Amazing game that got ported horribly. Unless you want to wait for loading times lasting 5+ minutes - wait for a few months after release and read reviews again if problems were fixed.

Let me just state that I love The Last of Us. I've bought it twice on PS4 and PS5, I played through 2nd part multiple times. It's the game that makes me sad that people who aren't into gaming won't be able to experience the same story and emotions that I did. It is one of those games that you get console for.
Now let's talk about execution of this port:
Pros:
- It looks good, very good. The character models, environment textures, the lighting - looks incredibly good. And this game supports widescreens!
- The performance is adequate. I'm running mid-level rig (ryzen 5600x, 32 GB RAM, RX 6800XT, 2k monitor), which is ~10% above the requirements for 2k resolution that was posted by developer. And 95% of the time I'm getting steady 60 fps. But there is a problem with loading time, read below...

Cons:
- Performance. I don't know how and why this happens, but even having game on M2 drive doesn't save it from loading time. It's so comically bad that I had to time it. I'm 80% done with the game at this point and I've spent: first 2 hours compiling shaders in main menu (because if I tried running the game before it was done - game would crash and imagine trying to refund this game afterwards, since your 2 hours of refund time ran out while you were staring at the main menu), during ~10 hours of gameplay I've stared at ""Please wait"" loading screen for 42 minutes. Sometimes I had to wait for 2 minutes for a game to load a 10 second cutscene and then I'll be facing same ""Please wait"" screen while the game was loading. What the hell is that?! To load up the game from main menu you also have to wait for around 5 minutes (had to wait less when running TLOU 2 on PS4 on HDD). My PS5 has less problems running the same game in 4k and you telling me a superior hardware can't do it? This is simply ridiculous.
- Bugs. I've played a lot of ND games, obviously most of them on PS4/5 and I've never encountered as many bugs as in this game. Don't get me wrong, it's not like it happens every 10 minutes, but when it happens - it breaks the game in a bad way. On multiple occasions: Ellie didn't jump on a float and Joel got stuck next to her. Had to reload the previous checkpoint. The workbench weren't usable even when the prompt to use it was showing, so I had to either ignore it or proceed to reload previous checkpoint;
- Controls. It got a little bit better with recent patches, but still feels weird. The mouse doesn't have a smooth motion, when you move it - it's as if you're not using a mouse, but rather you mouse emulates the gamepad stick. It moves in a ladder diagonally, almost pixel by pixel, which makes it look like your camera can't move in two directions simultaneously (either X or Y, gotta choose one). Some of the keyboard keys utilized are just weird, J to shake a flashlight? Very convenient, when I have at least 3 keys around WASD that aren't utilized."

[spoiler]Let me tell you a story about a boy whose one of the major hobbies was video games as he was growing up
He would also spend time with his friends outside 
But as he would comeback home from friends or school he would either boot up his pc, his x360 or ps2 (that was all he owned and still owns it to this day)
One day in 2013 he finds out about a post apocalyptic game with an emotional driven story and as soon as he saw the gameplay he was blown away
He then started googling websites and see if he could download the game, he couldn't because it was only on consoles. He then went to online stores to see if he could order a physical copy of the game for his x360. He then found out that the game is only ported on ps3, something that he didn't owned and couldn't own because ""your room is already filled with pc and two consoles, you really don't need a fourth platform"" - said the parents. He eventually grew into his teens and desired the game more and more and started envy anyone who managed to already play it by now. He asked his parents if he could get a ps4 since it's more modern and has more modern games than a ps3 and a remastered version of the game but the parents still said no. Time passed by and that boy is now an adult, has a well paying job and a girlfriend, but the game he desired for almost a decade by now is nowhere to be found in his steam library (getting a console for one game is pretty stupid now that I own RTX 3050). One day around the fall of 2022 the guy who was once a boy, gets one of the best news of his life. The game he wanted to play since the childhood, is getting ANOTHER remaster and this time it is being ported to the pc. He patiently waited and waited, day by day with excitement. The day finally comes on March 28th 2023 (pretty much 10 years later by now lol). The guy install the game, unpacks the game and builds shaders which makes him wait another several hours. But after those few hours he gets to finally touch the game for the very first time in his life. And in the first 30 minutes of his gameplay, all of his smile, excitement and happiness gets shattered into pieces.[/spoiler]

I honestly don't even know where to start...
Guess I'll start from the very beginning
As soon as I went to options and saw that I have 4 VRAM and the game requires atleast 5 on lowest settings, I already had a feeling that the game is NOT gonna look great or even good before even starting it
In the first 30 minutes I saw: 
terrible looking character models
pixelated mirror reflections
few ""please wait"" texts popping up on my screen
even more terrible looking face models that were also missing a lot of detail
And I saw Tess literally having the time of her life by stroking up and down while T posing in front of me (that was the exact moment when I just didn't knew what to do anymore so I simply facepalmed)
Keep in mind that this was only 30 minutes
Later in the game I discovered ""cyberpunk"" areas (those who had this glitch will understand exactly what I mean)
Water that looks like oil 
Joel's thick, black eyebrows (surprisingly I didn't experienced black Joel like some people have)
And more ""please wait"" that extended way longer and forced me to just re-load my save file

The next day I continue this...torturous journey (yes I was really desperate to beat the story for the very first time in my life)

I say fuck it and decide to test out ultra graphics (keep in mind I have 4 VRAM). This is where I get a mini heart attack because the game immediately crashes and doesn't let me in because even the loading screen crashes (but I minimized my screen resolution to the lowest and managed to get back into the game)
More missing textures, more please wait and more ""cyberpunk""
And also encountered several crashes 
Oh and almost every letter, whether it's in pause menu or main menu or notes that you read in the game or subtitles or pretty much any letters that appear in the game are missing and that was another problem that I had to overcome in the game because in some areas I would get lost and would need a hint but couldn't read it because 90% of the letters are missing so I am forced to pretty much restart my game
The game is basically more of a struggle and less of an enjoyment at this point
But I finally manage to reach an end of the game after many bugs, crashes and ""please wait""s
Oh and you thought Left Behind was gonna get better right? well lemme tell you something, it was worse...

None of the issues I mentioned has to do with the story or it's characters. In fact some cutscenes would load up just fine and I would get to enjoy the emotional scenes without any bugs interfering. But it is a one big nasty interference of my enjoyment of the gameplay and in the end I ended up more disappointed than happy, because this was the game that I waited for 10 years (read the real life story with spoiler text to understand the context better)

Don't know when they will fix the game or even fix it or when will I own a PS5 because I really don't see a reason spending 600$~ just to play one game, but I know one thing that this whole experience was just sad...and my sadness has nothing to do with the story of the game..."

Until then my review remains NEGATIVE.

Patch 1.0.4
NVIDIA driver update pack 531.68

Started the game over again for the X time, to see if it helped. Game wouldn't even start efter the patch. Veryfing files found an error.
Back to building shades from hell......

Rendering is better.
But after the patch, the game freezes every now and then for a few seconds. Then the xboxcontroller stutters, or stops responding.

Find it hillarious that I've supposedly played the game for 14 hours now, according to stats... LIES... I have spend time reinstallaling the game twice, adjusting settings, and waiting for the shade building. Not even once have I managed to get more than 45 minutes into the game, before I rage quit.

This release is a disgrace. 
The game should not be avaialble for purchase at all. We should all be offered a refund.


---------------
04-20-2023  Nvidia upgrade out so I thought I'd try again. Naive I know.
Couldn't even start the game. Un- and reinstalled. 
Then the same stuff obviously - 45 minutes worth of building shades and I lack words..... 


................................

Patch v1.0.3
NVIDIA driver update pack 531.61

And what's the change? Absolutely NOTHING - RIP to this game - once again building shades - force quit the game at 32%.

DO NOT buy the PC version, unless you have a monster PC gaming rig. 
Much better option, if you really want to play this game - buy the PS5 version.


.................

The patch v1.0.2.0 has helped a lot. 
Still not to the point were I can reccomend the game, but it's a start.

Combined with the NVIDIA 531.41 patch, there is now a visual difference. Still stuttering and odd rendering. Hair still pixelated. Slight blur if you make your NPC spin and turn fast.

Xbox controller now works.

Shade building after the patch started at 98% and it only took 5 minutes until I was able to start playing.
VRAM usage seems a little less heavy. CPU is still plenty busy, but not at 100% all the time.

Wating for the next patch. 

..................

Never in all my years of gaming have I played a fully released game that uses 100% CPU for over half an hour to build shades. 
I moved the game to a separate SSD to see if it made a difference. It did.... somewhat. Before the move, the shade building took almost 1 1/2 hours. At least now i ""only"" have to wait half an hour plus.

Game is supposed to have full controller support - it does not. 
My xbox controller that works fine playing other games, simply stops responding.

My character constantly gets stuck on inivisble objects, or simply stops walking all together. He can reluctantly be persuaded to run a litte faster than a turtle. And that only for ultra short bursts before he get's stuck again.

Getting my character to crouch, I have to spam my B button several times. Same with getting him to stop crouching.
Applying bandages only works half the time - and trying to fight the infected gets old fast.
Wierd rendering, stuttering and so much more. Having now tried to start the game 3 times, and NEVER even getting much further that a few mins into XX years later, I give up.

This is ridicolous.
I have never played a full release that performs so badly - even the worst ea game work better than this.

Can't even get a refund because I have ""played more than 2 hours"" - no I have not. I have waited for shade rendering, and have tweaked settings. As to actual gameplay 45 mins max."

Why didn't they make a PC port that's at least similar to Uncharted ?! It just doesn't work, shaders that take several HOURS to install. Loadings every 3 minutes (some of which crash). But above all, the game is absolutely NOT optimized, I struggle to exceed 25 fps on low settings whereas I could run Uncharted on high settings at a pretty constant 60 FPS, it's just ridiculous. And I haven't even mentioned the bugs... Anyway, wait for a fix or don't buy it at all.

POST UPDATE: 
After several updates and fixes from the developers on the game, I can tell you that it's still a SHAME. I have never struggled so much to run a game. It says that I have played for more than 30 hours, which is absolutely false, I spent three-quarters of that time installing ****** shaders that take forever.

Guys, seriously, if you have a configuration that is just below the recommended one (but still well above the minimum), it's not worth it, DO NOT BUY IT, IT'S A RIP-OFF. I would really like to get a refund."

Iron Galaxy is considered to be a low end cheap porter if you just want to port your game without worrying about cost, and yeah, the multi billion dollar company chose to do that one. But do you want to know what really annoyed me? You see, playstation (who in this I will be addressing as Sony), bought out a company called 'Nixxes', famous for there perfect ports, for example, if you have played The Amazing SpiderMan on PC, games owned by playstation, so they used Nixxus, and it was a AMAZING port, sure, it had its issues here and there, but for the most part, I had no complaints whatsoever, now, I'm assuming Nixxus had other things they were porting, but this is probably the biggest port of the year, I was roughly 13 (Or so) when TLOU came out in 2013, I watched a markiplier video about it, and I wanted it so badly, but all I had was a rusty laptop, I checked literally everywhere, couldn't find it on my laptop, I knew it had to come in the next couple of years, it did not, so you could say I was waiting for this for 10 years. Now, here are the bug I encountered. Crashing: Happened often during changes of lighting, explosions in cutscenes, often when I am fighting with a gun and I shoot somebody when the gore comes I often crash, I crash when I die sometimes, I crash when there is a new sequence. Number 2! Loading! It takes me roughly 5 minutes to just load in, roughly 3 minutes to skip a cutscene, roughly 2 to restart a cutscene, and roughly 10 seconds to start a cutscene. Number 3: Cutscenes! Cutscenes if I lag will not skip to the point where I should be, rather finish the frame and then continue off of there, and not stop the sound, so it will be extremely out of sync with me managing to have a clip 15 seconds after the voice line has been said, say it. I find even in the most dramatic moments, it can turn into something hillarious, with people T-posing left and right, either that or glitching through something. When Tess was giving up her life, she was bald. BALD. There are so many other reasons why this is a horrible port, but I am going to stop it here. Thanks!

Thank you naughty dog, you turned Last of us Part 1 into an Idle game.

(Edit) The developers/porters used a bugged release of the Oodle decompression library (2.9.6) which has confirmed memory leaking issues.

I moved a DLL file named (oo2core_9_win64.dll) From a Warframe install into the Last of us part 1's directory and the performance has increased quite significantly and the shaders were able to finish building in under 10 minutes compared to 76 minutes previously.

Not sure if this will work for everyone, people have reported that the DLL can cause audio issues or even more stuttering frame rate.

Hopefully this helps some people actually get in game let alone play the game they paid almost $100 for."

I have watched a playthrough of this game 3 times before it came out on PC. I even decided to give the show a watch, while not as good as the game, I think it deserves it's own praise for what it tries to do. I was absolutely stoked when I heard that The Last of Us was getting a PC release. I would finally be able to play my favorite game that I never got the chance to play, or so I thought. So far, I have spent almost 4.5 hours building shaders, building more shaders, adjusting video settings, building more shaders, and crashing to destkop a total of 3 times in the first 30 minutes of the game: twice in the prologue and once right after. I have spent more time ""getting the game ready"" and dealing with it's issues than I have actually playing this game. 

I really want to give this game a good review. I REALLY do. I know Naughty Dog have put their heart and soul into the original, so it pains me so much to see it butchered like this for a PC port. I'm running a 3070 ti on a pretty beefy gaming PC, and I STRUGGLE to get a constant 60 frames consistently without stuttering and CTDs. I thought Cyberpunk had a bad rap for it's poor optimization, but let me tell you, I can run that game with ray tracing on high settings (albeit a bit framy), fairly consistently after its fixes in its current state. This game? Not a chance on even the basic medium settings.

I would give a lot to play this game (even now I'm currently debating upgrading my graphics card again just to get the extra vram that I need to make up for some of the issues), but I just can't justify anyone wanting to experience this game at a moderate level to buy it in its current state. I'm not sure if it's a driver integration issue, optimization, the porting team, or what, but I can tell you for certain, you won't enjoy the issues, and you are extremely lucky if you haven't encountered any yet.

Wait until the game gets fixed. As of now, Naughty Dog has released two patches for it in the first week of its release, and while I can't say if it fixed any of its original issues (as I haven't even had the chance to play it because I've been building shaders and working this entire week), they still exist. For the sake of the reputation of this game and new people wanting to experience it because of the show, I hope that the dev teams figure this out. This is still my favorite game, and I will still continue to try and play it, but I hope that it gets the love and care that it deserves and not this kind of treatment.

EDIT: After upgrading some hardware, it can be run without crashes. I believe the issue lies with how much VRAM the game consumes. With a large VRAM overhead buffer, the game seems much more stable and can be run without stutters or performance problems."

Lemme go into more details:

The inventory system is bad and finicky. For example, if you have a rifle in your hand and you quickly want to switch to a shotgun, because a clicker is running towards you. You have to press and hold the 1 button and scroll up to select the shotgun and then Joel will get it out of his backpack. But by then the clicker will be in your face and they can insta-kill you. And if you don't have any good melee weapons at hand it's game over.

This kind of weapon select system was good in the PS3 era when you had a controller which only had a few buttons but the PC version it should have been solved better. Like for example with a weapon scroll wheel like in GTA games.

Secondly, there's the cover system. When Joel takes cover behind cars, crates ..., he sometimes faces the wrong direction and you have to maneuver him around to make him turn to the right side which can be annoying due to the fact that your camera is facing more towards the direction in which Joel is looking. Sure you can press aim button and tab button to make him switch hands while aiming a gun but if let go of aim then he'll revert to his old position facing the wrong way. 


I played this game on my old PS3 and hoped that the PC version would have better mechanics, more suitable for PC gaming.

Lastly there are the performance issues that everyone is complaining about. I mean, open world games with better graphics run better than this, so what's the deal here? The game isn't even using raytraced shadows or reflections (you will notice that you sometimes can see your own reflection in mirrors but not on other shiny panels, like glass, water ...). So why does this game need so much system resources?

It is entirely due to the bad optimisation, not your GPUs or CPUs. And no, you should not have to overclock your hardware to run this game if you meet the minimum requirements."

After that I cranked the settings to medium (well exceeding my cards VRAM) but I experienced no crashes. Textures in medium settings are very inconsistent, some textures like the floor were at times hyper realistic but I was consistently taken out of the world by textures that did not meet the same standards.

This release in it's current state should be avoided at all costs. You'll most likely spend more time trouble shooting and loading than actually playing the game and it creates a very frustrating interaction with the software.  Performance is very inefficient, in fact I cannot get this game to perform nearly as well as the console release and this has been my first experience like that. If you own a PlayStation 5 console, for now,  that is most likely going to be your best avenue to experience this masterpiece of a game.  Will update this steam review as fixes are released but if you feel like you NEED this game on PC, use third party shops to get it heavily discounted.  Google Cheapdigital downloads, day 2 there were many copies that were around 50% off retail price.  You may have better luck with this than I have had, but do your research.

• RAM: 32GB DDR4
• GPU: 4080 16GB
• 1440p

The Last of Us was one of my favourite games on the PS4 and I was excited to play the remake. For the first couple of the days this game worked well for me (for the most part) at 1440p with all settings maxed out at Ultra. I had major stuttering throughout the opening sequence and was nervous to play the rest of the game but everything settled down and played smoothly after that. I had a few minor graphical glitches but nothing more and had 0 crashes. In addition, the game looks beautiful with these settings but has a considerable drop in quality if you lower the textures.

After the first patch all of those graphical glitches seemed to have disappeared and the game continued to run smoothly. After the second patch the game became UNPLAYABLE. While everything was still smooth, the audio wasn't and was constantly crackling. None of the audio settings seemed to fix the issue, nor did restarts.

At Ultra settings, the game uses over 13GB of VRAM which is insane and is likely the cause of issues others are having. It seems you need high specs for this game and any GPU with less than 12GB of VRAM probably won't run well on Ultra settings. I have seen this game use 6GB of VRAM with graphics set to low.

In conclusion, I can't recommend this game, at least for PC. This is a masterpiece with an extremely shoddy PC port. As people continue to have issues, other things may break so it may be wise to wait until it's all fixed, if playing on PS5 isn't an option."

According to Steam, I've played the game for ""5 hours"". I most certainly have not. Why? Because the load times are ridiculous, it runs about as well as Forest Gump before he figured out he didn't need the leg braces, AND I spent well over 2 hours downloading the shaders for the game just sitting in the menu. 

The first time I ever booted it up I was hoping the other reviews talking about how poorly it performs would not affect me. A mutual friend who also loves this game gifted it to me because he knew I couldn't afford to buy it myself currently. A real pal, thanks Phillips. While in the first loading screen to start the game, I sat for so long that I decided to bust out my blueprint writing homework and work on that while I waited. Eventually, for shits and giggles and for this review I knew I'd have to write, I thought ""I should time this, it's already been a while"". So I pulled out my phone and timed how long the first loading screen took me to even start the game. 4 minutes, 20 seconds, 5 milliseconds. THE longest loading screen I have ever sat through and no, I still didn't get to play the game at that time. The game promptly crashed. The second time? Loading screen was 1 minute 39 seconds. A lot better but still pretty long. I could forgive it if it meant I got to play one of my favorite games though, so I trudged on. Like the naive little bitch I am.

I like to think I'm capable of putting up with a lot. I don't have the fanciest PC that's ever run currently. It was a beast when I built it 7 years ago but of course now it's just a fine PC. Nothing to write home about but it's more than capable of getting the job done. However, I had such a horrible time playing through the intro that I stopped playing as soon as the game gave me control of modern-day Joel. So that was maybe 15 minutes of actual gameplay in? And that was no stealth, no combat, just walking and cutscenes. My average framerate was 28 FPS with frequent stutters and dips into the lower numbers. And yes, it got worse once the game picked up and more started happening on screen (ie. the car crash, explosions, infected running around town, etc). It got to the point where the dialogue no longer matched up with the animations, the game would freeze about every 10 seconds into cutscenes, and was extremely choppy. For lack of a better word. I wasn't expecting to be able to play the game on super ultra beautiful mode, I just wanted to enjoy one of my favorite games on the PC since I don't have a PS5 and now I'm left feeling as if I can't even do that. I hesitate to try it again, but I'm sure I'll try to play it again sometime this weekend. It just saddens me that this is the standard of gaming these days. I'm old enough to a remember a time when you could rush home from Gamestop, Hastings, Walmart, Target, whatever on the release date, plop the game in your desired console, maybe wait for an hour (depending on how far back we want to go..) for it to download and you played as much as you wanted without crippling issues till you got the red ring of death or the console sounded like a jet engine on a plane trying to take off. I miss those days.

Definitely do not buy this game and play it until it is fixed, if ever. Also, I too had to turn off the ""film grain"" option in the menus. It gave the game a weird look and it hurt my eyes. Just in case that helps you out as well."

I originally played it on the PS3 and it was a marvel of its time to end arguably one of the greatest generations for the consoles. That being said this PC port of the title doesn’t do the game justice. To put it bluntly, it runs terribly to the point of being unplayable. 

Now you will see reviews of people memeing and saying just get a better PC, but I have what is considered to be a high-end build with a Ryzen 9 7950X, 64GB of DDR5 6000Mhz Ram, a RTX 3080TI MSI Gameing X Trio, and all SSD storage. 

First loading in(after letting the shaders build and restarting), the game was utlizing over 12Gb of VRAM at 1440P Ultra. This wasn’t too much of a issue as I was getting roughly 80FPS with very small dips down to around 45FPS. For this style of game that was very playable and it lasted this way through the beginning prologuge. Then fast forward to meeting Tess, the game performance got dramatically worse when with larger dips. The dips occurred at scenes that didn’t matter though so I kept chugging along until just after the first introduction to the spore scene where it was unplayable. I dropped the settings, to try and conserve VRAM and get a more stable FPS when I experienced a hard crash. 

I have a RTX 4090, that I finally got around to ordering on the way mid April, but wanted to write this review for any interested in saying that this game is not playable at 1440P with a RTX 3080TI. Your milage, may vary if you force the resolution to 1080P with the same card.

That being said, I think this game when it was working looked beautiful, and I know it will be worthwhile to play once they fix at the very least the hard crashes. I am running the latest version of the NVIDIA drivers which at the time of this review is 531.41 so its also possible this may be a driver issue that hasn’t been reported yet..

From a optimization standpoint the game is actually well optimized for PC in the sense that it is making full use of the hardware, including benefiting from having a SSD, however its not translating well to ingame performance. I feel bad to say, but I would not recommend this game to anyone at the moment until, ether a combination of patches fix hard crashes, microstutters, etc. Alternatively, NVIDIA, comes out with another driver release to see if further optimizations for the game can occur. I will also just say that if your card has less than 8Gb of VRAM you should not buy this game.

I will update my review at a later point when my new GPU comes in but for now not recommended as well I can’t play the game.

Things to consider if you end up buying it at its current state:
If on linux, shader building seems to happen every time there's an update patch (from experience), regardless of how small, which gets annoying. There are some other issues such as the game not reading your total VRAM correctly either, but there are workarounds and you will need a bit of tinkering.
For windows, some people report having no issues other than shaders at first, but given the overall reception the game has gotten, I would still wait a bit

This was meant to be better than that and the steam deck I play on is meant to be along the same lines as the ps4 ""power"" but this game looks awful and if you try to put up the settings it's fps drops and jumps like hell. 
If they just put the standard remastered edition on the pc it would have been better than this. I'm guessing they will optimise it in the future. But they should have not released it until it was truly ready.
I'm putting it as not recommend at the moment, until they fix it. Then it could be amazing.

On first launch, the initial config didn't display until the game was tabbed out and back into, and building the shaders took the better part of an hour while grinding everything else to a halt by pegging the CPU at 100%. Patch 1.0.1.5 addressed those problems, but even on an NVMe SSD, load times range from 2-5 minutes; it loaded faster on the PS3. While the opening cutscene looks stunning on Ultra, Vsync didn't work at all until forced on through NvCP, and the game runs no better and is just as likely to crash on Low. And when it crashes, it brings down the whole system, forcing a hard reset. Most of my ""play time"" was spent (re)building shaders and trying, with no success until Patch 1.0.1.6, different graphics options to reduce the constant crashing and omnipresent stuttering. Right now, it runs smoothly until it crashes, which it does with alarming and annoying regularity, and it still takes way too long to reload.

And this is just a few weeks after Sony whined to the courts about Microsoft/Activision leveraging platform exclusives or sabotaging competing platforms with buggy releases.

Edit: I did manage to eke out some extra gameplay by downgrading my graphics driver from the latest, which has a known issue of crashing TloU on 30xx series cards. It ran with some minor visual glitches but otherwise flawlessly for about 6 hours, after which point it just continued to crash over and over again.

Also, I just want to add that, as I wrote this review, Naughty Dog posted that the next patch is expected to be released on April 4. While Steam has been offering refunds, regardless of play time, Naughty Dog and Iron Galaxy let the game sit, broken and unplayable, over the first launch weekend.

1.0.1.7 resolved nothing, even with the Nvidia hotfix driver.

However, this isn't a review of The Last of Us, this is a review of the PC port of The Last of Us. I have been waiting for nearly a decade (this game took way too long for Sony to port to PC) to play this game for myself as I never saw version exclusives as a reason for me to buy a console when I've been gaming on PC for over a decade. When I heard this game was receiving a PC port, I was ecstatic. I'd finally get to play one of the greatest games from the early teens. If only I knew what I know now: we'd be receiving a very shoddy port job courtesy of Iron Galaxy :). I don't want to cause anyone to stray away from this game (as it truly is one of the greatest, story-rich games of all time), but in the current state the game has been released in, I simply cannot recommend anyone buying it. If anything, wait for a sale or wait for the game to be released in a (hopefully) fixed state. Granted if you're really impatient, I hope you're okay with dealing with the game crashing every 30ish minutes or so. I still intend to play through and just suck it up and deal with the crashes, but this has been an eye opener that, even with ports unfortunately, it's best to wait and see how the quality of the port is prior to making a purchase. Again I reiterate, this review is only negative until they fix the crashing issues. 

TL;DR: An amazing, story-rich game unfortunately marred by constant crashes.

Update: I learned they've extended their refund policy for this game and have since refunded and gotten my money back. I will either use that money on the game at a later point in time after the crashing has been patched or (more likely) spend that money on Star Wars Jedi Survivor when that comes out at the end of the month. Whichever (probably the latter) comes first."

Artifacts are there left and right, like several scenes where out of the sudden everyone gets dripping wet for absolutely no reason, Tess having an extreme hair loss (only have her hair are there, she looks as if it's all white and you can see her skull through it), FSR has extreme ghosting and shimmering.

The worst of all is the ridiculous loading times. Over 5 minutes IF it loads. Many times it hangs and stops loading, others it just decides to quit.

[b] This is an apocalyptic failure [/b]

Sony trusted one of the least like or respected companies to port us a masterpiece after seeing the hatred the community has against Iron Galaxy for previous works. First we suffered Days Gone rendering horribly, then HZD and its fps stutters and now MY MOST ANTICIPATED rerelease, and you spit in my f**kin' face? 

Sony (and Naughty Dog) you know we love your games, clearly. We keep giving you our money for your games, so why are you not taking the upmost care for the community patiently waiting for you to get your head out of your ass and release your IPs on Steam for PC. Yet you've done nothing but ruin it nearly every time. 

You blew it out of the water with the Marvels Spider-Man and MM. You and Nixxes did it, you were amazing. Now you've managed to ruin any hope for the future of your releases all because of Uncharted and The Last of Us. You keep letting this happen and you need to stop. 

All I am saying finally to this is if Bloodborne, the diamond in the rough that I am hoping to see SOON releases and suffers the way the past releases have been, I can maybe at least say for me and a decent majority of your supporters will never trust Sony as a valid hope for PC games. 

Take your time Sony (and Naughty Dog). Fire Iron Galaxy and never fu**ing work with them again. You guys literally have Nixxes. Its proved time and time again that it works better.

I’m running an i9-13900KS on an X790 motherboard with an ASUS Strix RTX4090 OC Edition graphics card and 32Gb of DDR5 6600.  I consistently score better than 99% of machines in all 3dMark online benchmark comparisons.

And yet at HIGH graphics settings and DLSS enabled in PERFORMANCE mode, the game has a coarse, choppy, stuttering frame rate with fairly frequent pauses even after a complete shader compile.  Its absolutely immersion breaking, and very disappointing.

In every other game, I’m wishing and searching for graphic setting better than Ultra, and in this game, I’m hunting for things to turn off to make this title as smooth as it should be on my machine.

if this was $19.99  I might let it slide, but at 3 times that price, this title should have been perfect out of the gate on PC."

How is that that the Updates just make the game more unstable???
Even longer loading times.
Sometimes the game wont even open at all!
I was beginning to enjoy the game.
Then you broke it again!

Thumbs down for DONT GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW! But thumbs up when all the issues are fixed!
This would be a real shame for such a massive game to flop here on PC


The game has just had 2 updates, since launch I noticed the game was unstable, dropping in frame rates ect but the game was still playable on my ryzen 9 rtx 2080ti.

Sure the Shaders took ages to load too but i continued to play the game while they were installing. Didnt seem to be an issue.

The bigger issues now are the loading times and now before the updates, they werent so bad, yes they were long. but now!! after two updates the game is no longer loading! or takes much longer to load making it unbearable to wait to even play!.

The Last of Us Part 1 is a highly anticipated game that recently released on PC, and as a fan of the original console version, I was excited to dive back into this post-apocalyptic world. However, since a recent update was released, the loading times have become unbearable and make the game unplayable at times. This is a huge disappointment, as it significantly impacts the overall experience of the game.

Aside from the technical issues, The Last of Us Part 1 is still an incredibly well-crafted game. The storyline, characters, and world-building are all expertly done and draw you in from the very beginning. The gameplay is smooth and satisfying, with a mix of stealth and action that keeps things interesting.

As for my PC system, I have an AMD Ryzen 9 with an Nvidia RTX 2080Ti and 32GB RAM, which should more than meet the game's recommended system requirements. Despite this, the loading times are still unacceptably long and detract from the overall experience of the game.

In conclusion, The Last of Us Part 1 is an excellent game that unfortunately suffers from technical issues that make it unplayable at times. I would highly recommend waiting for a fix to the loading time issue before purchasing, especially if you have a similar or lesser PC system to mine.

Definitely wait! until its all fixed.

Once I get into the game, it's stuttering like there's no tomorrow. Every other second was a second of a frozen screen. This is after the 2 hot-fixes, by the way. I get to the part where the car crashes, literally 10 minutes in the game, and I turn it off. I look up for solutions online, and I do everything, including fixing the integrity files. And guess what's the first thing I see on the bottom right corner? "" BUILDING SHADES 1% "" NOPE, NOT WAITING 16 HOURS AGAIN.

Due to Steam's totally fair refund policy, I'm already over the 2 hour timer (only 10 minutes of actually being in the game, the rest of the time was sitting in the main menu waiting for the shaders to build), and I pre-ordered the game during Christmas. I refuse to even attempt to play this game until I get consistent frame-rate, no stuttering, and all of the other issues in the game. I also refuse to wait another 16 hours for the shaders to build (that's not an exaggeration btw, you hear most people waiting eh, an hour, maybe 2..

What was originally a poorly optimized but overall bearable experience has now become borderline unplayable. Hair textures on all characters do not load properly and are stuck in the lowest level of detail and quality. Because of this character models and custscenes look LAUGHABLE and genuienly looks worse than simply just playing the original PS3 version of the game. Entire areas of the terrain and flora have similar issues or are missing textures altogether. Micro stuttering is still a persistent issue. The game still eats up as much RAM as it can get its hands on. This port is a joke. Disregard any semblance of positive sentiment in the rest of my review bellow. I no longer have faith that Naughty Dog and Iron Galaxy can fix this mess in a timely manner. I am frankly baffled they even tried to port this game in house if this is the highest quality they could achieve given their resources. The executives behind the management of this port should be ashamed, or even just fired altogether.

[outdated]
I decided to roll the dice and purchase it anyways and I sorta got lucky. The game runs okay. The stuttering is not as bad as others have reported it to be. I run the game on medium settings at over 60 fps pretty much the whole time. The only times the game feels like **** is when it starts to stutter real bad and the frame times become incredibly inconsistent. This doesn't happen most of the time. I'm hopeful they will patch the game and make it more playable but for those looking to play I would just wait. This port is the worst port out of all of the Playstation ports thus far."

I actually own it on PS4, but the overhauled graphics and such on a much more powerful system one would figure it would get better. The launch reviews were rough, and I thought I had made it through with a good install. I waited the 1 HOUR AND 15 MIN for the shader compilation processing. Everything was great, no graphical corruption, or any of the crashes I have seen about online and in other reviews. That is until about 3hrs in and I hit about 8 stuck spots in total. Every single time the NPCs would path into a choke point and I could not progress the story without restarting each of the segments. This last one, I cannot even work around it by rolling back to the check point. Elle popped into the path in front of me and is just standing there now. I would have to restart the entire section/chapter, which I was just about at the end of. The graphics overhaul looks amazing, the fluid simulations in the puddles (actually all water for that matter) look amazing. The Keyboard and mouse controls are actually quite intuitive. Which normally I would praise, but not when I can't play the game without speed running it always staying in-front of the NPCs, or constantly reloading back at checkpoints and having to re-play through them so I can stay in-front of the NPC's. I am over the time for a typical refund but this seems to be the trend for this game. I should have listened to the reviews. I have also recently refunded Days Gone for how horribly that was ported. I also ended up purchasing and returning a Sony branded gaming monitor because it was so poorly built, and has borderline false advertised features. I was very excited when Sony decided they better start stepping into the PC realm with their games/gaming centered brands. I exclusively buy Sony TVs, and was ready to expand that over into my PC life as well. I am done buying just about anything Sony at this point however. In the last two years I have seen their quality flat out tumble to nothing except the TVs, just so happens my Sony headphones just crapped out this week as well.

I bought this game after looking at the reviews so I knew I was gonna have a rough time but I at least thought the problems would start after I opened up the game, but to my surprise whenever I tried to open it said that windows 10 or higher is required (I have windows 11) after about an hour of trying to fix it I finally got the game to start. Got into the main menu and I made sure not to do anything before the shaders were done installing (to ensure my CPU wouldn't explode) which took as long as you think it took. Then I created a save and started playing and took a look at how my memory, CPU, and GPU was doing. CPU was consistently at 100 percent even though i waited for shaders to download like everyone said to do so this doesn't happen, of course it did anyways. To my surprise my 3070 was at 98 percent and my memory was at around 80 to 90 percent which is okay compared to the rest. Keep in mind I am on medium settings not even high. Then i switched it to low and it didn't change at all. At this point I didn't care and continued playing and surprisingly it ran well up until the 20 years later chapter and I had insane visual bugs, I can't even explain how bad it was so i restarted the game and nothing changed. For everyone looking at these reviews, it does not matter how good your specs are, this game is a joke and most of these reviews are going very lightly on the game.

I do get very high framerate playing the game, but the framerate goes all over the place. In some area connecting close to next area, the framerate goes from 120 all the way to 80-90, with GPU is being relaxed and CPU not even maximized.

More pathetically, the game feels unsmooth unless you set your framerate target to be 60 or 120. this is something even gsync/freesync couldn't save simply because the camera logic is broken outside of targetted framerate.

**********************         TLDR        *********************

So far Ive been playing on my 2021 Razer blade 14 3060 on Low-Medium settings, DLSS on auto. When it was unlocked Frame Rate I was getting an unstable 100FPS and while it mostly felt smooth enough, the quality looked so downgraded so I locked it to 60 and it looks much better as DLSS isnt working so hard top achieve max FPS. Seems to help but from one area/ cut scene to another, things vary from ""pretty **cking good"" to ""did this look better on PS3?"" in regards to textures being so smoothed out and low level detail on both environment and characters. Overall playable though and mostly locked at 60FPS TBH. 
I LOVE playing TLOU with mouse and Keyboard! this is the way it should be played being able to flip the camera behind you  quickly while running away from runners, Im embarassingly bad at aiming with a controller so this is the best way to play for me. But still, I cant help but feel like the PS5 version is the definitive way to play this game with how badly optimized this port is. 
That being said, THIS IS PLAYSTATION and they're flagship IP, I  don't see them sitting idly by while people and critics rip it apart. They're more then likely going to throw resources at this to save face ASAP... And hopefully by your next playthrough it will be the best way to play TLOU P1... Im being very optimistic here, but mods and player fixes will definitely enhance the experience in th future. But the fact it was even released in this state baffles me so who knows what PS is thinking.
*** I Have had a very different experience with my desktop (2070 - 9700k - 32GB RAM) So the first time I loaded shaders it crashed and lost all progess. After the second attempt i got impatient and loaded the game with 17% shaders compiled, then crash to black screen until I reset my PC. so finally I got the shaders loaded it took almost 2 hours to finish this last time.

You know that PS4 port called Days Gone to PC? You ever noticed that the port from Days Gone to PC worked great??!!!?? I have over 100 hours in that game. Its an amazing port from a console Sony PS game. I never had crashes, graphic glitches, etc.

Whoever they chose to port Last of Us Pt 1 to PC was the WORSE CHOICE ever and I hope they are never allowed to port a game ever again. I mean come on. ITS THE LAST OF US! (Yet we all know they will port another game and do this all over again because AAA ports just break). 

Days Gone didnt get a sequel due to Sony saying it had poor sales - which is complete NONSENSE. Days Gone was a great game. 

The Last of Us got a TV SHOW and a SEQUEL game!!!!! Plus they wanted 3-4 weeks to polish the game because of how popular the show was. But what do we get? We get the #1 crashing game I have ever played. The game requirement specs are just off the charts it seems. My MSI 2022 gaming laptop has not had any game yet challenge it. (And I did upgrade the laptop)

Did they TEST the game?! Like actually play it on different computers with different processers and video cards? Because its pretty OBVIOUS they didn't!

This better get better. 

Does not matter what setting you play on - IT CRASHES.

With that said DO NOT BUY THIS RIGHT NOW. The game is poorly optimized and crashes consistently. Most machines that are over the recommended specs (mine included) can not play this game reliably. If you really want to buy this game (and don't own a PS5) then I would suggest waiting a few months to see if they ever got this thing fixed. If you do own a PS5, just buy it on there as, unless your machine was built this year with the most expensive parts money can buy, you won't be able to run it at the quality of the PS5 version anyway. 

I want to see this port fixed, I want the PC community to be able to play this game that is so dear to my heart, and I want to see what modders will end up adding to this game. But as it stands now, as much as I hate to say it, do not purchase this game right now, you will be disappointed."

AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core Processo  3.80 GHz
16.0 GB RAM
Geforce RTX 3090

As you can see, not a bad PC but this game crashes, stutters and literally locks my PC after 10 minutes of playing, if not earlier. NOTE; This is after 2, what I would class as emergency patches from the devs, qand its literally unplayable still.

I watched the series after seeing the PS games and wishing for so long that it would come to PC. Lo' and behold it comes after the TV series and it's absolute garbage.

I have refunded my £60 for obvious reasons and i'm lucky that I can because some people have already exceeded the Steam play time refund limit just from trying to load into the game or building shaders. 

The devs and ports company should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves for releasing a game in such a bad way. Leave the gaming industry, you shouldn't be in it if this is the quality that you're happy to release. GTFO.

I cannot recommend this on all honesty and this is the first time in my life that I am going  to review this on a digital magazine as strongly negative and put me in front of the line against Sony itself but I need to be honest with my readers.  This is in no way production ready.

First, allow me to state my specs so you understand why I'm not recommending it:

Basic Specs:
- Core i9 13900K
- 128GB DDR4-3200
- RTX 3090 Ti Custom Water Cooler
- 1 x 2TB WD SN850 as boot drive
- 2 x Intel RAID0 - SN850x as gaming drive
- SoundblasterX G6
- LG C1 OLED TV

Now onto Refrigeration:
- Lian Li O11 Dynamic XL
- Top: Watercooler for CPU: Liquid Freezer II 360 with fan's replaced by 3 x Phanteks T30-120 running at 2000RPM max
- Side: 3 x Intake Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM
- Bottom:  30mm Corsair XR-7 360 Radiator + 3 x Phanteks T30-120 running at 2000RPM max
- Rear:  1 x Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM
- Extended Heatsinks for each M2 on the system.

Now onto performance:
- CPU at full load during this game:  66C celcius
- GPU at 4K + DLSS on Balanced averanging 90 FPS at ULTRA settings:  59C celcius
- 41C for the main M2 drive
- 44C for RAID0 drive1
- 45C for RAID0 drive2
- No overclock on the CPU
- No overclock on the GPU
- Average Cinebench performance for my CPU:  41250
- Average Read/Write speed for my Gaming RAID0 in CrystalDiskmark:  14420/12950

As you can see, my system runs beyond normal parameters, with extremely low temperatures taking into consideration the hardware at hand.

The first time Building Shaders took 10 minutes with all CPU's at 100% -> completely unacceptable.

First time playing the game, got 10 freezes and 3 crashes in just 1 hour of gameplay, could never go past the prologue.  After researching over the internet, it was found out that the libraries for: 

nvngx_dlss.dll
oo2core_9_win64.dll

Have issues. I've replaced both and the game magically stopped crashing.  I was able to start playing it, for real.  That is until yesterday when the crashes began once again.  

Reason:  a new patch got out and it took me some time to realize that the actual patch overwrote those files again so naturally the crash-fest started.   I've overwrote those files again and naturally, everything started working again.

Today the crashes began once again and sure enough, a new patch was out.

Conclusion:  Even with all this time they had on their hands, they managed to keep introducing crashes because their current libraries are bugged.  This may not crash for some, but for others like me.. this is totally unacceptable.

I'm running a high end PC with last Windows 11 22H2, rock solid with no overclocking and an extreme cooling solution for both CPU, GPU and M2 units.

Game still runs like garbage and they still refuse to replace the broken libraries.

Now, taking all of this aside and considering that I've managed to fix it by replacing the libraries (as most people did), the game moves like crap over the mouse.  I've tried every possible solution but mouse movement is like moving the mouse through sand,  it is almost unplayable unless you force your refresh rate to 60hz and enable vsync, which will totally kill inmersion for me as I specifically built this PC to be able to enjoy 120hz, which is also stated as an option on the main menu of this game.

They launched the game with broken libraries that send tons of PC's into oblivion taking hours to compile shaders when they could just fix that by replacing the broken library for : oo2core_9_win64.dll  which changed my building libraries from 10 minutes down to 1 and also removed all of the crashes but they didn't.  They didn't fixed the mouse movement on a game that they launched on PC where the most important attractive is to be able to move your character with the mouse for christ sake and on top of this.. they put the bar so high on the VRAM usage that most of the people without 24GB of VRAM are forced to lower the graphic quality.

I'm not engineer but jugding by the way this game uses the memory (both RAM and VRAM) I could swear they tried to replicate the PS5 memory behavior by replicating the storage on both RAM and VRAM like this is a shared RAM system, and I say this because every time the RAM memory usage goes up, so it does the VRAM.

Right now, when I have VRAM at 10GB I have the main executable using 10GB of RAM and when my VRAM goes up to 14GB, my main RAM usage also goes up to 14GB.  Pardon me for suspecting that they are actually dumping RAM into VRAM to simulate a PS5 but that is what it appears to be happening, which could explain the super slow load time, which is 5 minutes to load a map... WITH MY CURRENT STORAGE SPEED.

And with all this being said, I get constant stuttering, jitter in mouse movement, maps and sections that take minutes to load and the need to mess with local libraries for the game to run properly.

You cannot say my CPU is overheating
You cannot say my GPU is overheating
You cannot say my storage is overheating
You cannot say my CPU is insufcient
You cannot say my GPU is insuficient
You cannot say my storage is slow

So, what can I say then?.  I think the truth is pretty evident."

I tried TLOU 1.0.1.5 and 1.0.1.6. Setup is RTX 3060 Ti (8GB VRAM + 16GB Shared, 531.41 driver), i7-10700F, 32 GB RAM, 720p. Compiled shaders before starting the game (45 minutes). Game continued to crash during the first minutes of the prolog. Not to mention shader or texture bugs. After reducing from default config to high, I could at least do the prolog, but the next crash was not far away. This is no fun. And the practice of releasing broken games deserves boycott.
---
Edit 4th April: Just installed the nvidia hotfix 531.58 and the 1.0.1.7 - the shader compilation starts all over again. So suggest to wait until the patch next Friday arrives, which hopefully reduces the compilation time significantly.
---
Edit 8th April: 1.0.2.0 and/or 531.58 seem to have done the trick. The shader compilation stukk took - once again - 50 minutes. But the game itself seems to run now much more stable and less resource hungry.
---
Edit 13th April: With the above patches and hotfixes, I have not experienced crashes anymore. The only bug that sometimes annoyed me was the broken scope, which many seem to experience from time to time. The game itself is one of the best story games - visuals, sound, story writing, characters, voice acting etc. is all top notch.

3923,1,0.3648,"run, setting, pc, fps, performance, port, even, low, still, well","So I will write this by emphasizing that the first TLOU is my favorite game of all time, I am NOT writing this bad review of the GAME ITSELF, only the PERFORMANCE of it, how it runs. In the regard of the game-play combined with the story this game is easily a 10/10 to me, especially since I have already played this games remastered version back in 2013 and beat it MULTIPLE times.

So when it comes to a remaster the main thing to discuss is how well the game looks and runs. Now I run a RTX 3080 Ti, AMD RYZEN 7 5700G with 32 GB of ram. My computer is considerably beefy, and for the life of me, I can NOT get this game to run smooth in almost any area of the game. It is choppy and terribly optimized. Overclocking helps a bit but it makes the game crash faster it seems. My modded Skyrim with 600 mods runs better than this.

There is no combination of NVIDIA Control Panel settings or in-game graphics settings I can use that makes the game run well while making it look well. I would have to half the resolution to make it at least 60 FPS and even then the game is choppy and stuttering. The game looks gorgeous whenever you stand still and take a screenshot, but the moment you start moving, it turns into a mess. 

Now as for crashes I have only experienced 2, which for a single player game is not good by any means, but this only seemed to happen whenever I overclock my GPU so I just steer away from doing such and I am fine, but by no means does this excuse the countless people who are complaining about up to 14 crashes which is just unbelievable. 

Now for the question... should you pay 70 dollars to buy a game that has been optimized as good as Cyberpunk? Not right now. Sadly, we have to do a similar routine of: Game release, game runs like shit, gets shit on for running like shit, then after 6-8 months the game is actually playable. Now, to be fair, they ARE releasing daily updates about this game. I don't know what they do, but they are actively fixing it I hope. 

TLDR: DO NOT BUT THIS GAME RIGHT NOW IT RUNS LIKE ASS, MAYBE COME BACK IN A FEW MONTHS."

The release day they happened pretty much after 5 minutes of play time, now you may get to play an hour or two if you're lucky but they will come and then again it is back that 5-10 min time frame.

For Sony and Naughty Dog, this PC release seems to be money grabbing scheme in the wake of the TV-series hype, as the original game was released 10 years ago or so, remastered after that couple of times and re-released and you still dare to ask full price. But hey, that seems to be the way these days and like they say in my country, the one asking the price ain't the fool, the one paying the price is.

I wouldn't have bought this game myself but my nephew got it for me as a Christmas present 3 months ago and because of that I decided I want to experience Last of Us as it should be for the first time, so I didn't even watch the over hyped TV-show to not spoil the game experience for myself.

So far the silver lining in this is, that for some reason, my nephew got to play the game without crashes and his PC is less powerful than mine, partly made of parts of my old while I have the newer CPU, motherboard and better()?) GPU.

It seemed that the game run pretty much perfectly for next PC configuration: Intel i5-11600K, Asus TUF Z590 motherboard, 16 GB RAM, 256GB + 1TB M.2 SSD and Asus ROG Geforce RTX 3060Ti with 8GB VRAM.

For my configuration, result are the random crashes to the desktop with specs: Intel i5-13600K, Asus TUF Z790 motherboard, 32 GB RAM, 500GB + 2 TB M.2 SSD and Asus TUF Geforce 3080 with 10 GB VRAM.

Another difference is that my nephew is still using Windows 10 and I upgraded to Windows 11 sometime in November 2022, so who knows, maybe all of this partly Mickeysoft fault as well?

My advise to those thinking of buying this game, do not buy, not until it is in Steam Sale with more than 50% discount. I usually buy my games from Sales like that because last decade or so, the big game publishers have become more greedy and push their games to the public before they are finished and properly tested."

Aiming for me was a nightmare and I stopped mid-game after getting increasingly frustrated with the controls and myself.

And now IT'S ON THE PC!!! I grab a copy on release and try to play - NO! I couldn't get it to build the shaders. The game froze and crashed over 30 times during the process, building 2-4% of  shaders between crashes. Finally the shaders were built and I reduced the quality to Medium and that's with 13900KS + 4090 both LQ.

Started playing and ""enjoyed"" 4 game freezes and crashes in the first 15 minutes of the game play, not cinematics, actual game play when I control Joel. 2 crashes happened when I used the flashlight in the basement. I guess lights and effects trigger those.

it is a good story telling type game, very simple combat mechanics made for a controller. for people who believe they are inclusive, they are not for left handed people. arrow keys are locked and tied directly into the weapon cross system that they still use, they upgraded the graphics but not this system.

no choices: linear game. forced to kill even when sneaking and when it is important to kill you can't, to be forced fed a Narrative ""for the story"". a lot of story ""flaws"" but still enjoyable.

one of the worst ported games i have played, it needed more time. ND needed a dime, so the dime is on us for them to fix a port game.

as of this edit the game still has visual bugs. you can't p/u some items at times. my computer still crashed every hour after spending hours figuring a work around, patches should fix this though.

there are people playing this game with no problems( so you may be a lucky one if you decide to purchase) and of course you have the people that love this game so much that they will say or do anything to shame the people who are having problems craziness actually.

My game hasn't crashed a single time yet and the building shaders thing didn't take much longer than 30 minutes maybe. My issue is the constant stuttering. My fps are at an almost constant 60 but it keeps stuttering which is really annoying, especially in high tense and stress situations. Also my CPU usage sits at a constant 95-100% while my GPU usage sits at 10-15% which also just confuses me. It is playable for me since the stutters seem to have gotten a bit better as I have progressed more (maybe I also just got used to it) but I do not recommend it right now.

PC ports are always bad, but I've yet to have seen something as bad. I've a 3070 and an overclocked i7. Even then, I can't smoothly run the game, and somehow, the patch they released started giving me crashes left and right.

To those who still wish to play the game, you literally mod it. Downgrade from DX12 to DX11, replace the Oodle decompiler in your folder with a fixed version (nab it from any other game or google where to get it), use some DLL tweaks off of a modding page and maybe, maybe then - you can have a smooth experience.

In my case, before the unPatch, the game ran with so many micro-stutters I couldn't believe my FPS was 90. The mouse movement feels jittery and jagged, n' at parts - even on the lowest settings the game manages to look like a Roblox knock-off and still run with 30 FPS.

Stuttering, crashing, and CPU utilization at 100% -- even on the loading screen. CPU temps climb into the 90s. My PC plays all the other AAA games just fine with very low temps, but this game destroys my CPU.
EDIT: I've been playing now for a few days and some of the issues have been resolved -- including the high CPU utilization and high temps. The game still does have some crashing issues every 15-20 minutes, but I'm hoping that they fix those soon.

4069,3,0.4314,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","I originally left a positve review, but after finishing the game I will be switching it to a negative review.

The game ran fine, I had no issues there. No crashes, and it seems after the newest patch the shaders build much faster. Game looks and run great!

But after finishing the game, I'm not sure it's worth $60. The story was pretty great, and I thoroughly enjoyed it throughout, although the game play just isn't fun.

I'm not sure if it's just meant to be played on a controller, but with mouse and keyboard the combat seems far too easy even on survivor, and never really had problems with ammo or supplies. The AI is probably pretty bad even for 2013 standards (although this is a remake) and it's a bit puzzling how it was both this simple when the original released, and how they probably didn't touch it in the remaster.

Enemies ""flank"" which is basically them leaving cover to walk up for a free headshot. Other enemies sit in place and will not move, making it easy to flank them in return. The stealth is a bit of a joke, where it seems the enemies will always move towards you, allowing for easy stealth/shiv kills. You can clear entire areas without firing a shot or moving from where you are. Just throw a bottle and stealth kill away.

The crafting/looking for resources is a bit of a chore. Doesn't feel like exploring is really that well rewarded in terms of interesting collectibles/lore. A few interesting stories here and there like that of the sewer base that is overrun, but nothing too crazy.

It's by no means a bad game, but a game that is probably a bit overrated due to it's good story. I think it would be fine to hold off on this until it's closer to $30, rather than pay the full $60 if you've been waiting all this time to finally play it like I have. I don't know if I'll ever replay this as the story was the only part pulling me through, and the actual gameplay part of the game isn't great.

Much better remakes/remasters are out there. Go play RE4, Deadspace, or Days Gone which are much better games imo."

Problems started during first boot up. The water effects glitched, creating oversized polygons on impact and lowering my fps to 5 or below. Restarted the game and that fixed it. 

I played for two more minutes, got to a cutscene, game crashed. I restarted the game and played for 5 more minutes. Got to another cutscene and the game crashed. I decided to stop there. 

In total play time of 30 minutes, the game crashed twice and had one critical glitch that required restart.

To be honest, I don't mind all of the time it took to download, unpack, validate, and compile. I'm a patient person and I won't give a game a thumbs down for that. But for a game to boast how fantastic it looks and then crash even when running the 'performance' settings, that's just sloppy. Graphics to me are a nicety but are way at the bottom of the list of priorities for a good game. If a studio cares more about great-looking graphics than about stability, they failed.

Seems like playing with PS5 Dualsense is fine but oh how I'm so wrong.

The stuttering issue persists even if you're using PS5 controller but it's significantly much lesser than using the mouse and keyboard.

Shader compiling takes 30+ minutes but that's fine by me. I'd rather wait than having to play Stutter Protocol all over again. But even after shaders has been compiled, the game still manage to run like crap. The VRAM usage is inconsistent. Some scenes 11.5GB of VRAM some scenes just 9GB.

So if you would like to play this game now, USE THE PS5 CONTROLLER FOR THE CURRENTLY BEST EXPERIENCE, i guess. If you use M&K, you will be frustrated with the stuttering issues or better yet, WAIT FOR THE FIXES THAT TAKES ROUGHLY ONE MONTH (based on what they did with Uncarted).

At this point if Sony still hasn't fired the whole team in Iron Galaxy, I don't know what to say. Uncharted was once abyssmal and now this.

Edit Don't get me wrong, I LOVE THIS GAME. This game is one of the best game I've ever played on PS. The graphics are almost realistic and beautiful. The story is rich, the gameplay is very smooth and fun and the soundtracks are literally pieces of art. But this port this unacceptable.

Edit2: I was one of the lucky ones who don't have any crash issues. Now new patch just came out (1.03) and now I just can't launch the game (at all). The game just simply stuck at patching (100%). I had to uninstall the game and reinstall it and had to go over the shader building all over again. Then, the game just crashed like 5-6 times when I turn around at a very high speed.

This game crashes a LOT in the main menu to the desktop OR reboot my OS... WTF??. After many many many tries compiling shaders and seeing all cores/threads of the CPU at 100% load and rebooting my system or crashing to the desktop,  I realized that maybe is too much for the OS to handle this piece of crap, so I went to the task manager and I set affinity core/threads to all but two (meaning I leave two cores for the OS and the rest for the game).

After that I finally could finish the damm shader compilation. Once in the game, no matter which part (closed or open area), it consumes a lot of system resources 12Gb of VRAM, 23Gb of RAM and over 65% of the CPU. I mean the game doesn't look that good. A lot of low res textures and stuff, many games have better graphics with less requirements.  

If you play with no Vsync there is something weird with the mouse, some kind of laggy behavior. I don´t know... you can notice this is an excellent game but in this state, they deserve all the hate. What really piece me off is that I don't think they can fix the high Vram/ram/CPU usage, i really don't because they released a table of requirements with a 4080 for the recommended system requirements, coooome ooon.

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Lots of people have performance issues and also loading shaders for an hour before you even get a chance to play the game might instantly be a turnoff for the people who have never played this game before and don't know if it's a game for them or not. Plus people experiencing crashes or loading errors, yeah man people aren't happy with the state the game released in and they're not going to praise it even if it is a good game (which it is) mainly due to the fact PC gamers go the short end of the stick when it comes to experiencing tlou and what's even crazier is that if youve got a good enough rig you could just emulate the ps3 version or just straight up play the ps3 version without experiencing all the stutters, and crashes. It's an amazing game at the end of the day with engaging gameplay and a story you'd completely invest in but since this port is horrible think about how many people wont be able to actually enjoy this game for the first time, it's sad but reality. Personally I'm fine with capping my game at 30fps since i've always played this game on console. 

We can't be completely negative towards the game because it is of course the last of us. I do think it's great that they included the DLC idk if that's standard with the ps5 version but i think we should all be glad that we didn't pay 70 dollars for this port. The new coat of paint has me in awe at every moment it pops out, mainly in the lighting even at low settings it looks gorgeous. I can't say the same about the textures of course but that's due to the limitations of my hardware and im not gonna complain that I can't have high res textures. I don't think the graphics necessarily justify the 60 dollar price tag though.

Do i recommend the game? Yes, definitely Joel and Ellie have such an emotional journey together I've experienced it so many times since the game debuted on the PS3 and watched the TV adaptation which got me even more hyped for the game. Unless you've got a good rig or a good enough rig to play at 30fps at low if you're comfortable with that, i wouldn't recommend the game.

Uncharted 4 was, and still is, just as rough. And for those saying they are getting a solid sub-60fps, the idea of running a game like this on PC is to see how far the visuals and performance can be pushed on a platform with far better specs than the console could ever have.

While trying to get back my save I verified the game files and the stupid building shaders started again. I'm done with this game now. Will return in a few months and see if anything has improved."

Sadly, I'd discourage folks from getting this right at launch (unless they have hardware that can handle the extreme VRAM requirements). Mind that the recommended settings seem to shoot a little under what you need to have a good time. Even running 1080p looks like it eats up your card's memory.

The egregiously long time it took to build shaders is inconvenient. The fact that this thing *devours* your VRAM is kind of strange, and seems to imply poor optimization. They got this to run on a PS5, but to have nice textures you need about 10 GB of VRAM at 1440p? Low-Med settings with the FSR cranked and still using ALL 8GB of my VRAM (and then some).

Hopefully it ends up running more smoothly for folks that are having more trouble than I am.

Truth is no matter how up to date your hardware is, this game just will not work. This is a terrible port of a good console game. The loading time is slow. The screen stutters just from browsing the menu and freezes constantly. And don't get me started on the shaders! Seriously it should not take 2+ hours just to build shaders. I've never had that issue even on the worst console ports. I never got around to playing the actual game because I didn't want to wait on the shaders. I downloaded the first patch, but all it really did was make the shaders load slightly faster (and by slightly I mean it started at 11% on startup and then lagged the same way it did before).

The Last of Us is a great game. One of the best. But the PC port is downright terrible. If you haven't bought this yet, then don't. Save up for a console and play this the way it was meant to be played. As for me, I think it's time to dust off my PS3..."

I always enjoyed it when my friend let me play on her console from time to time, but obviously I never had enough time to actually finish the game in one go. So when I heard that it was coming to PC, I instantly knew that I would buy it. However, now that I have it (and played like, 85% of the game), I absolutely regret buying it. It's not about the gameplay or the story, but just like everyone else already said; the optimization. Now, I don't have a High End PC or anything, but it's also not like my PC is total crap. It can usually run any game on high graphics at 60 FPS no problem. But with TLOU, I can barely get through a building without my game going below 20 FPS and freezing every two seconds. Occasionally I can't even shoot properly because the game is just so laggy, therefore I'm constantly wasting my materials and I sometimes have to play checkpoints 5 times over because it's just so unplayable. And yes, I already tried following some optimization guides, but it only helped so much. Now I'm in the last chapter of the game and I tried to set my graphic settings to medium because I'd rather be able to play the game than enjoy the graphics for once, but before I could even apply the changes, my game f*ing crashed. I was gonna finish the game tonight, but now I just want to refund it and never think about it again.

TLOU in itself is a lovely game with a great story and great gameplay, but I recommend anyone who thought about buying it now to wait a few months until it's on sale.

PERFORMANCE 

The shaders took me nearly an hour to render and i suffered 9 crashes to desktop during that process, yes 9. I have had less crashes in my over 4,000 hrs of warframe than in just the setup phase for this game.

For those suffering from poor performance/stuttering in gameplay, let the shaders fully compile before starting the game, the compile times on anything are unforgivable but i personally haven't suffered from the stuttering issues or hitching that others have complained about.

When in game disable the chromatic aberration and the film grain, then enable DLSS or FSR in the games 'Display menu', this should gain you back some performance. After that the games graphics options are shockingly in depth and are more comparable to the Serious Sam 3 options for how many things there are to tweak so you have a fair bit of wiggle room to play with.

As a final note the load times are also abysmal, if you have the option install this game to and ssd/nvme drive, I can actually make a cup of tea in the time it takes to load this game.

Overall I got this for free with my graphics card so i can't complain to much but i don't recommend buying this until they fix it, this is the same studio that ported Arkham Knight to PC and they haven't learned a thing in the last 8 years and Sony still went with them anyway."

I wouldn't much care how it looks, except that I'm still getting stuttering and freezing on the lowest settings, and I can play games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and the newest call of duty just fine with some graphics tweaks.

Even after restarting my PC after shaders complete building, shaders start building all over again, every time I launch the game.

Also, the audio is too low and muffled when characters are speaking. Unless I turn up my headset to the maximum, I can't hear a thing. In a story-rich game like this, that is a major problem, too.

Not to mention that this game eats VRAM like it's nothing. Those of you hoping to play this on a GPU with less than 8GB, be prepared for a rough awakening - the game easily eats up to 12GB of VRAM on ultra settings.

A company like PlayStation, with such a big reputation, skimping on their top game and allowing it to release for PC in such a state is a mockery!

Iron Galaxy needs to be axed. They can't put out a worthwhile product to save their lives.

2nd Update: Fuck Iron Galaxy. It appears that LITERALLY nobody at IG ever thought testing the game was a good idea. They've put out shitty ports before, they will again and again until the company is dismantled and everyone there finds a job in another industry they're more suited for. Still have random crashes that are completely inexcusable for a full price game and a game with so much financial backing and prestige. 

*Update*: New patches are an improvement, but the game is still inexcusably poorly optimized. Game looks about on par with a late PS3, early PS4 game but even with a decade's worth of GPU improvements over the original hardware, the game runs like relative dog shit. This is precisely the age of game that should run on middling hardware extremely well and it runs like wet trash on a modern semi-beefy setup. 

I reiterate, Iron Galaxy fucking sucks.

*Updated again*: Still has major stability and performance issues even on a machine that doesn't have stability or performance issues with other games.

running a 3070 with 128gig of ram on an i7 and it crashes constantly and on the recommended settings for my rig! My entire rig feels like its about to set light to itself with the insane heat its putting out and im fairly close to throwing a bucket of water over it. WHY?........

Because this game is so poorly optimised its a joke! There was no issue with days gone being ported and graphically intensive in ultra settings but this is just a hot mess! To add that proverbial nail to the coffin making it unplayable is the controller support witch is non existent, it works...... but you cant move five feet without the character stopping then starting again whilst using the analogue sticks.

Needless to say i was excited about a masterpiece that would outshine the amazing experience i had with days gone but this is utter garbage and i wouldn't recommend until its been patched what will probably be at least 200 times before summer is here.

There's definitely some optimization issues that cause slowdown and FPS drops, but at least the constant crashing, major graphical loading issues, and gamepad input issues appear to be fixed. All of that said, I still wouldn't recommend buying it, at least not anywhere near full price. Wait until they've put some more patches in and it goes on sale.

It's really bad. Once you wait for shaders to build and the game to finally load, it still runs like crap regardless of settings. Textures don't load, lots of stutters, a jittery camera, and constant crashes. I was able to make it through the opening sequence despite some of these issues, but now it crashes every 5-10 mins so it's effectively unplayable.

I've seen a lot of others here ranting about the vram usage, system ram usage, CPU usage, stutters, and crashes. I can thankfully say after 4.7 hours so far. I haven't had a single crash, running on 4k Ultra keeping 60+ fps with DLSS on Quality. The 100% CPU usage was entirely due to the game building shaders, and oddly had 100% CPU usage when downloading this game, which is bizarre to me as I've never had a game download on steam take my entire CPU. if you got less than 32gb of ram, honestly, forget this game. It may run on systems with 16gb ram, but when you're out of that. you'll be paging into the storage for virtual memory which can hurt your storage and rapidly decrease it's life span. I'm seeing 20gb ram usage while ingame, and seems like it's not much different on lower settings. Medium settings even 1080 hogging 8gb vram which is absurd for the actual texture quality you get at that setting. Ultra at 4k takes around 13gb. Biggest thing is, once shaders are built. experience is mostly pretty ok. Theres issues with the mouse stuttering when looking. But to be fair, with my system. it's easy to say I had a relatively decent time so far with the game. But that doesn't excuse the shape this game shipped in. sitting for an hour to build shaders, CPU being hammered while it happens, and even ingame afterwards, i'll have random spikes from 56-65% to 95% usage out of nowhere for several seconds. Given it's hardware usage, I'm shocked this even got verified for deck Considering the deck only has 16gb memory which is shared between GPU and CPU. They should never have given this to Iron Galaxy to port, given their reputation with the infamous Batman Arkham Knight port. But as it is at the time of posting, I wouldn't run this on a GPU with less than 12gb vram, and less than 32gb system memory if you even want a relatively alright experience. For now. Just wait til it's patched, if Iron Galaxy even cares to. It's absurd that this game hogs so much of my PC's resources to run at all.

Constantly crashing as per everyone else's review. I do however have a possible workaround and also added issue that despite the workaround makes the game unplayable for arrow key players (not WASD players).

Firstly, the added issue that makes the game unplayable for arrow key players is that using the arrow keys keeps bringing up the Weapons Cross and this means swapping weapons every time you move. You cannot remap the Weapons Cross keys, very frustrating and a game crippler for arrow key players.

Now the good news (maybe). Long story short. I read a review that said let shaders fully load 100% and the game runs okay, but mine never did, they get to 20% and stopped.  I wondered why and according to Task Manager the CPU and GPU were running at 100% and 16GB memory maxed out also, the Shaders ran for a bit, increased a little and then crashed.  I had spare RAM and so put 8GB extra in making a total of 24GB and that worked!  The shaders loaded to 100%  and the game runs. Problem is for an arrow key player as above I cant play the game because of the keymapping problem.

Have logged a helpdesk request so fingers crossed for a patch.

In order to play decently you have to let the shaders compile, and this takes forever (I think I am 20 mins in and I am at 20%), and it looks like the compilation time doesn't change much even for super high-end specs. I played the first 15 minutes of the game until I got stuck at a splash screen saying ""Loading, please wait"" every 10 metres, probably because of missing compiled shaders, I don't know, but this is simply ridiculous, I mean not even Morrowind in 2002 had loading screens, and at this is no open-world game. On top of this the game eats up 7.5 GB of VRAM at medium texture details, plus 24GB of RAM, and this is frankly speaking unacceptable. No game I've ever played so far went beyond 16GB of RAM usage, including Cyberpunk at day one, and believe me that the graphics of that game is not comparable with this (open world game with way better graphics). This is simply put lazy and poor programming. As for me, I am going back to play Atomic Heart until the fix this. You should do the same. It's an awesome game which shows how a game should be released. I hope this ends up like Arkham Knight and that gets removed from the Steam Store, because at the moment this is just a scam.

I didn't want to waste that time on shader compilation screen so I downloaded the jack sparrow version to see if I can play it without issues. I installed the jack sparrow version on NVMe SSD and launched it. Shader compilation took approximately 30 minutes. First, I tried with ultra settings and DLSS on Quality. It uses almost 10GB VRAM on ultra settings even if you turn on the DLSS. My 2060 has 6GB VRAM but I tried the ultra settings anyways. 

I got 60-80 FPS in the beginning of the game but the first 15 minutes doesn't really put that much pressure on system. After the Sarah part ended, FPS dropped to 45-55 but when I switched to High settings with DLSS Quality, I could still get 50-60 FPS when I'm outside. I could get 60+ FPS when I'm in indoors. After I saw that I can play the game without issues, I deleted the jack sparrow version and launch the game on Steam. The Steam version's shader compilation completed after 15 minutes. I've installed both versions on the same SSD but Steam version's compilation didn't take that long. I've played the Sarah part again and I got 1 crash at the end of that car scene. I didn't get any other crashes for now. If I encounter other issues as I continue to play, I'll edit this comment.

By the way, I forgot to mention but the game uses minimum 80% of the CPU and 24GB of my 32GB RAM. I saw some benchmarks and it uses almost all of the RAM available if you have 16GB. CPU usage is also a joke. First time I see a game that uses at least 80-90% of the CPU.

My System Specs: 

CPU: Ryzen 5600
GPU: RTX 2060
RAM: 32GB 3200MHz (4x8GB)
SSD: WD SN570 NVMe 1TB

I agree that this port is poorly optimized. Especially the shader compilation and loading screens takes too much time but after you waited shader compilation, it is not unplayable imo. Maybe I'm a little lucky. 

Of course, if you are not that impatient for playing this game, you should wait until Naughty Dog release a performance patch. They said that they are aware of the problems (no sheet) and they will try to fix them (fingers crossed).

I won't change my review to ""Recommended"" until they fix these problems even though this is my favorite second video game ever. This game shouldn't have been released in this shape. Developers must stop releasing unfinished, unoptimized games. We saw so many examples of this in recent years. They also trust the upscale technology too much when developing a game. DLSS intend to be increase the current performance of the game, it is not an optimization tool.

*** UPDATE ***

I finished both main story and Left Behind DLC. FPS was not really a problem for me because I usually got 50-60 FPS on high settings. This is acceptable for me. But unfortunately, game still crashes. They released 2 small and 1 big update (around 15GB) but it didn't fix the crash problem. I found a temporary solution for this. When I play the game it crashes after 20-25 minutes but if I close Geforce Experience, I can play without any crashes. Some say Discord also cause this problem. So try to close Geforce Experience and Discord when you play the game. Maybe it is something related to apps with overlays, I don't really know but I can confirm that closing Geforce app helped me. Game also has weird graphics bugs. Sometimes characters' hairs, eyebrows and beards goes crazy. And sometimes, the ground become completely black. It usually requires to restart the game but it doesn't always help. Sometimes you just have to play that part with that bugs.

It is such a shame that we talk about technical issues instead of talking how good this game is. The game is a masterpiece but we can't even talk about that thanks to this sheety port. Well, almost everyone knows that The Last of Us is a great game, but still.

Completely recommended -IF YOU CAN PLAY IT WITHOUT ISSUES-. I still won't change the review to positive unless they fix the game."

Edit: After the patches the game performs a lot better. It is still a lot of fun, there's only a few graphical issues and lag I'm experiencing but it is still beyond unacceptable that the game was released in the state that it was.

Edit: Shortly after posting my last edit, the situation resolved itself and I was able to finish the game, I haven't looked at it since, Playing through the rest of it, it more or less functioned as it should and the Left Behind  DLC functioned just fine.

Here's another underpaid and underworked PC port by our dearest friends at Iron Galaxy, known for their fantastic work on:
-Arkham Knight (removed from steam after launch for 3 months because of how bad the port was)
-Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy (Constant option menu issues like the fps limiting itself with higher definition monitors, game flat refused to boot for certain people)
-Uncharted Thieves Legacy: (Mouse stuttering issues, same Shader loading problems as here)
-Rumbleverse (A Battle Royale that flopped on its face so hard they shut it down not even half a year after release)

All of this while Sony owns Nixxes, one of the most famously good PC porting studios on this side of the planet.

The Range of Issues in this one is so much more vast i'm fully expecting Steam to pull this off their store aswell at some point with these reviews.

Let's list a few: 
-Shader Installing takes about 4 hours, have fun refunding guys!
-Once Shaders are installed i'm about 200% sure you WILL crash upon pressing the play button (or just randomly whenever it feels like it)
-If you DON'T crash be prepared to be faced with game breaking issues such as essential NPC's getting stuck in terrain.
-If THAT doesn't happen either i'm sure you'll love all the 15 or so FPS the game will grace you with as it eats VRAM and CPU power like a morbidly obese person at a wedding
-Get past all of that and you MAY just get one of the MANY texture bugs the game still has up it's sleeve (Joel's face randomly turning entirely black for some reason, hair looking like it's made out of confetti, etc.)


Stay FAR and WIDE away from this shoddy attempted Sony Cheapout until it's worth actually spending the amount of money they expect you to pay for it by fixing the port up (if ever.)

Fast forward 10 years later and you can only imagine my excitement when I see that one of my favorite games from my childhood is being remastered for PC. I made the mistake of pre-ordering it, blinded by my nostalgia, and I paid the price in more ways than one.

The game is incredibly unoptimized, the shaders that the game heavily suggests you stay in the menu until they finish building take EASILY 30+ minutes of sitting there and waiting, the mouse/camera movement feels very rough, oh and did I mention that the game is not well optimized?

Naughty Dog had an incredible opportunity to get new PC players invested in the game that had never played it before, as well as players who had seen the hit TV show and wanted to visit the game that it originated from because they were either too young or had brushed it off when it initially released, and to say they blew it would be an understatement. Re-hiring the same studio that also did a trash porting job of the Uncharted Collection (Iron Galaxy) while not using a studio that you OWN that is known for doing a great job of porting games (Nixxes) is nothing short of a tragedy.

First, the story, writing and characters are absolute bunk. It's as if the story was written by the most uninspired Daytime TV Drama writers they could find. Every character personality is completely two dimensional, every ""twist"" or ""surprise"" is able to be seen from miles away. Nobody seems to be written with any sort of intelligence or sense, and the ""father/daughter"" thing that is going on with Ellie and Joel is incredibly bland and trite as well. As in: it's not done well at all, and is written in a way that is purposely trying to tug at your fee-fees. Refer back to ""uninspired daytime tv drama writers"". 

If the ""parent/child"" dynamic is your thing, Telltale's 'The Walking Dead Season One"" with Lee and Clementine,  and Detroit: Become Human with Hank and Connor (with Connor's Deviant / Pro Hank playthrough) do this dynamic way, way more successfully.

Gameplay-wise, the game is also incredibly middling. Generic, basic crafting system, and generic over-the-shoulder combat, fighting buggy / dumb AI. I would argue that if you want a generic third person story game / zombie shooter with crafting elements, then go play Days Gone.

For the hype, and especially for the price, I genuinely cannot see why this has received the praise it has. Maybe it was worth something when it originally released in 2013, but a decade later in 2023, it absolutely falls flat especially compared to what else is available."
4670,3,0.36,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","The Last of Us is one of my favorite games of all time. I absolutely love this game and the series. I pre-orded both TLOU2 and this the moment I could, and I planned on getting the Firefly Edition for the PS5 once I got one. 

But holy shit is this port so fucking disappointing, I've crashed three times just trying to build the shaders, and I ONLY HAVE 12 MINUTES OF PLAYTIME! It honestly infuriates me to see my favorite game be put out in such a pathetic state. This is unacceptable, especially after how great the ports for Dead Space and RE4R were. 

It boggles my mind that while Sony owns one of the most highly-rated developers for PC Ports, they choice to go with the team who made one of the most infamous PC ports of all time (Arkham Knight.)

And just like Arkham Knight, I'm sure this game will have a redemption story, and run beautifully soon. But I'm fucking sick of redemption stories in gaming. Why is nearly every Triple AAA product released in a near-unplayable state. These things should fucking work when they make it to retail. And I'm fine with a few bugs here and there, they're inevitable, making games is hard, and it's amazing most games get made. But when it's literally unplayable for most of the people who bought the game, it's fucking unacceptable, they should've delayed the game again. 

I'll probably keep my pre-order, just because I know this game will eventually be in a better state, and I do intend on playing it once it is, because like I said it is my favorite game of all time, but I would recommend people avoid buying this game for the time being, and if you already have, please get your money back. Steam offers full refunds if you have less than 2 hours of playtime. And if you're wanting to see if your PC can run it before refunding it, keep your eye on the clock because I've seen some people take nearly two hours just building their shaders."

One setup is a 7900XTX, 5600X, 16GB 4400 MHz RAM, and an NVMe high speed M.2 drive. On this machine I experienced 100% GPU AND CPU usage on the menu screen while shaders were being built. The shader build process took over an hour and a half for me. It kept freezing and crashing as well. Once this did finish, and I tried to start the game, the loading circle displayed for a couple of minutes before actually starting the game. There's significant load barriers, stuttering and crashing once in.

On another machine with a 6950 XT, 5600X, 16GB 3200MHz RAM, and NVMe M.2 drive the game hard crashes my machine. Once entering the menu screen the system freezes. It's a hard freeze where CTRL+ALT+DEL doesn't even work. Even holding down the power button on the front of my machine won't turn it off. I had to switch off the power supply to shut it down. I tried this twice with the same results. I literally cannot play it on this machine. I have all the latest drivers installed on my machine.

I know that once everything is patched, this will be an incredible game. It's an immersive experience that completely draws you in and will be worth your time. I just think that right now, at this point in time, it's not worth it. I would wait for them to patch everything so you can enjoy the game as it is meant to be played. Some people do report being able to play without too many issues, but it's really varied and essentially a dice roll. You may be able to play it, or you might experience a ton of issues.

On top of that crap, it takes 30 plus minutes to compile shaders. Which means if you walk away and let it do its thing, if you don't come back right away, by the time you start playing you are almost past the refund window. 

Apparently Uncharted was released in this state on PC and never fixed. Iron Galaxy and all of its employees should be blacklisted by all gaming devs and the community at large. F them. And F anyone who thinks releasing any game in this state is acceptable"

The game seems to be severely GPU intensive and that is where I think most people are experiencing issues with bottle-necking I get anywhere from [b]40-70fps[/b] at 1440p on high settings using AMD FSR 2 on quality with the occasional stutter but not enough to annoy me, not experienced any crashes as of yet like others have but I think that really depends on your hardware.

Hope this helps.

(Edit) Its been a few days now of playing the game and I have experience 1 or 2 crashes but nothing that didn't resolve itself and I'm pretty sure was down to me messing with some windows settings as I reverted them and didn't experience any problems since.

(Edit 2) Finally completed the game and the DLC, managed to get through it without any further issues, I'm sure that the crashes I experienced were down to my own doing and not the game itself.  Game was still running around 40-70fps usually in the 50-60 area unless I entered big areas. 

The DLC ran great was getting a solid 60fps+ at all times probably because the map is slightly smaller? Not sure but I had a much smoother experience during the DLC than the base game.

Overall I still recommend to wait until further patches, If you're running an older 10 series GPU you might want to hold off this game until you upgrade it."

I want my money back, Druckmann. You made the choice to use Denuvo and this is what you get, a overwhelmingly negatively received game. 

Don't buy this shit tier port of a game. Even if they fix it the stuttering will persist as long as denuvo is implemented. I'm trying to refund this scamware, wish me luck.

I may not have a high end pc but it should be good to run a remaster of an old game. For context i have a Ryzen 5 5600x, RTX 3070 and 32 GB 3200 MHZ RAM.

To begin the shader compilation takes like 40 min but whatever, then i have a 4k display but set dlss to performance (render at 1920x1080) and the textures on medium go over my 8 gb vram and low textures look awful (worse than the ps3 version), and since there's no fullscreen option you can't chose lower resolutions. So to play at 2560x1440 i had to set my desktop resolution to that and then use dlss (1280x720 render) to set textures to medium and even then the game performance dips all the time (from 90-95 to 40 fps). They even confirmed a memory leak among other issues.

So yeah, the last of us is one of my all-time favorite games. That doesn't mean i'll accept this poor excuse of a port. I don't care if it's day 1, games should release working fine, not after weeks of updates that fixes little to nothing. I didn't pay full price to be a beta tester."

Usually I'm more than content to wait until the reviews come in, maybe a few YT videos of actual game play. But The Last of Us has always held a special place for me. And, after they announced the HBO series, I knew I wanted to play the PC version. 

I was a little disappointed when they delayed the launch but I figured that they wanted it to be done right. So I waited while enjoying the HBO series, and even waited to watch the season finale so I could go right into the game after that. I didn't download the game until I got home on launch day. So while I waited I read a few early reviews. And hey......that can't be right. Maybe all of these reviewers are just expecting too much from a 10 year old game!

So I finally get to launch the game. And I wait, and wait, and finally the start screen of the game. ""No, I don't want to wait for shaders to load"". I've played the game enough to know what comes next so I mostly looked for differences in quality of the cut scenes, or something at least to make it somewhat better than the PS versions. I really don't see much that's different. OK, on with the game play. Wait, what's the deal with the extended buffering going from cut scene to game play? Well maybe the game wasn't fully loaded into memory yet. Yet it happens again, and again,  and again, etc.

Well, the reason I like PC gaming is better control of shooting with the mouse. So Joel and Tess start their journey to find Robert and finally, finally, I get the chance after 40 minutes of game play (because of the constant buffering) to actually shoot. What a disappointment. Yeah sure, it does give you mouse control of your aim, but with the slow response I would have been better with the PS controller. 

And after the second gun battle, I shut the game down and requested a refund. Maybe I'll try again 6  months down the road if I find out they've improved the game play. But this is not just an issue of a few bugs. Trust the other Negative reviews."

In few words, after waiting scores of minutes (close to 30mins) for a unusual and annoying compiling of shaders (first time seeing this), any video configuration (low-res, windowed, full-res, vsync on, vsync off... more than 1 hour try) lead to a blackout screen with sounds (makes birds sound a bit pricey) when launching the prologue.

So AVOID until patched and then wait for feedback from users and carefully check your config as reqs seem to be quite high for this game.

Update, so second night of playing. i had to work late so i only got two hours of free time after dinner. I dedicated both hours to this game. The game crashed the night before during the cinematic when Joel met Ellie so thats where i started. It crashed three times before i was able to get through that cut scene.

It crashed a forth time when the fedra guys apprehended them just outside boston.

It crashed again, when they were sneaking around the lights. when it crashed this time, i could not reload the game, it kept crashing during the initial loading screen after hitting 'continue' off the main menu.

Day 3

Day 3 is the day i officially gave up. Had to work late again so i only got an hour in the evening to play. i could not get past the 'continue' button off the main menu. the system crashed 4 times. I tried to load into the save prior and on the second attempt i got in i played for five minutes, and the game crashed while i was playing.

after a long hiatus and 3 updates i came back to this game.

I have a high-end PC (RX 6800 and R5 5600X) and I still have constant crashes and performance issues. The game spent HOURS building initial shaders. The menus are buggy and slow. If you do not update your graphics drivers, the game won't play above 10 FPS. 

It is also a complete loading screen simulator. I already spoke about waiting for shaders, but there is absolutely no reason a simple loading screen back into the game, when running with a PC of my specs and on an SSD should take the multiple MINUTES it does. This RUINS the experience of so many key moments of the game. It takes you out of the game, throws you into a loading screen, and your immersion is absolutely shattered. It really is heartbreaking for a game that is all about the experience.

The Last of Us Part 1 is a game about the zombie apocalypse, and if you need more than that you've been living under a rock for the past 10 years. This game made headlines in 2013 and more recently with its show release. Thankfully, Sony finally saw it fit to give us a PC port of the game, and my god what a damn shit show. Ryzen 5, 16 GB of ram, and a RTX 3060 and all I can get is a maximum of 58 FPS, which immediately drops to sub 40 and even sub 30 if you get in an environment that has any more than 3 npcs (including Ellie and Tess and any other friendly you may have following you!). 2 of the 4 hours of playtime were me sitting at the main menu waiting for shaders to download (twice, it wasn't a 1 and done thing), and messing with the settings to hopefully try and boost my performance a little bit. And I know my system isn't an issue because FFVII runs at 90 without a single hitch on the highest graphics I can get it to.

This landmark game deserves better. Another few patches are needed before I can change this review to be more favorable. steam keeps asking me to revise the review and I will keep replying thumbs down until the optimizations are on par with ps5

This game won’t even boot on my pc with an rx580 with no feedback just a crash report pop up. 

Also tried on steamdeck since Neil himself said it would work and there’s SD controller icons indicating that it’s meant to work there. Struggles to run above 22 frames in most sections even when all settings are low and FSR on ultra performance. 

Cpu cores are all maxed out at 3500 MHz even when nothing is happening on screen  I could be crouched in a tunnel looking at the floor and still cpu utilization is near 100% for absolutely no reason. 

I even took this to the extreme and set internal deck rez to 400p then did FSR on top of that so the game was working with a rez of around 100x120p. Even at that extreme a solid 30 is not possible due to CPU utilization leaving no headroom for gpu to even ramp up to 400mhz. 

Worse than that all texture settings are locked off currently, and even when setting to high settings textures still seem very blurry at native rez so it seems they are adapting textures to render resolution not actual asset quality. Usually my go to for deck is low settings but high textures. That’s not possible here right now

This port is beyond broken currently, the cpu bottleneck, texture issues, and general lack of stability is unacceptable. I’ve never made a steam review but I feel compelled to highlight just how bad this is Currently.

I have bought every iteration of The Last of Us since it's original release on PS3 all those years ago. That being said it's honestly embarrassing how terrible this port is.

You'll know almost instantly when you load up into the main menu and your frames are clocking at an average of about 20 - mid 30 fps. Never in my life have I experienced low frames in a main menu before even after shaders were compiled. Strange, but let's continue on.

There's absolutely no reason this game should be this taxing and demanding on your RAM, GPU, and CPU. it's asinine. I'm by no means running this game on a potato PC either my build is VERY much able to handle demanding games on high/ultra with little to no issues. But this? With everything on medium it's taking up 99% of my RAM and when I launch the game it sounds as if a jet engine just booted up inside my PC. 

I haven't experienced crashing, YET. (Let's hope I didn't jinx myself.) However I'm constantly teetering around 49 - 57 fps with some pretty frequent dips dropping down to the mid 30's. Again, on medium settings. Not to mention some textures are muddy and just God awful. I've walked passed signs on buildings that you couldn't even read due to how blurry they were. It was almost reminiscent of a PS2 title.

How on God's green earth Sony allowed this happen to one of their most famous IP's to ever release is on me. This one cuts deep. Especially caring as much as I do about this game. IF and I'm really praying here this is the case.

Buy it on sale and NOT for full price! 

Let Naughty Dog and Sony know that such a sh*tshow as this botched PC port will no longer be tolerated by us customers anymore, even if and when they finally perhaps completely fix it.
----------------------------------------
Original review: 

Even though Steam shows 2 hours of playing at the moment of first writing this review, I have not yet had a single minute of gameplay in this game, as it was still ""compiling shaders"" in the opening menus and I did not dare to start the campaign until this was finished. 
As I lost my patience after some time, I tried verifying the game integrity, which sadly then started the whole shader thing from scratch, hence I lost my motivation to wait any longer... 

My PC-specs at the time of the first review, in case anyone might want to know: 
Win 10 64-bit PC, 64 GB RAM AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1920X 12-Core Processor (12 Cores)
AMD Radeon RX 590 (VRAM 8192 MB GDDR5 2000 MHz)
And yes, all drivers up to date and the game runs on a SSD!

Seriously, Naughtydog, how could you f*ck this up so bad? 
The Uncharted games ran just fine at launch when I played them here on Steam, so why does not this?!?!

Also all other previous Sony exclusives (both Spiderman games, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone) that I've played on Steam did not have any comparable issues like this at all!

I've played both TLOU games on the PS4, but was always hoping and very much looking forward to finally play them on PC, where I can actually aim properly with mouse & keyboard for a change! 

At this moment, this game cannot be recommended, until Sony gets their sh*t together and fixes this!

I will update this review when the fixing patches have happened... let's see when this will be!
-------------------

*edit 01: A first 35mb patch came, which somewhat elevated the shader loading issue (even though it still took over 20 minutes for finishing up after booting up the first time). 
In turn I've had 4 random freezes and 3 crashes during either cinematics or gameplay in the prologue and 1st chapter.... therefor I cannot change my recommendation yet!

*edit 2: Loading times are sometimes abysmal, up to 4 minutes when starting the game fresh and wanting to continue from the last safe!

*edit 3: Every now and then, especially during regular gameplay, just random freezes & crash. Framerate is also always stuck between 40 & rarely 60 FPS, tried lowering a lot of things still no satisfying result!
#TheCrashOfUs

*edit 4: The 2nd patch, another ~36mb, did not eliviate the freeze + crash issue (as soon as a scripted sequence was about to start). And the framerate dropped considerably at the first encounter with the runners + clicker scene in the Downtown skyscraper...

*edit 5: The 3rd patch (again ~38mb) did not fix the above mentioned issue with the crashes. The Framerate sadly did not really improve that much either, in fact it drops extremely when enemies come into an area. I suppose this will take quite some considerable time before this PC port is properly playable at all for most of us!
PS: And the shader compiling ""fun"" started again, going slow as always... [Took over an hour to complete! Wow, it's the same if not worse than before!] I hope it will not have to redo the shader thing again, otherwise this will get worse and worse I'm afraid. 
BUT, at this moment to my amazement, after having started the game in ""safe mode"" I did not have any crashes... yet. The resolution and performance are far from good, but it's at least currently playable. 
Plenty of graphical glitches, some hilarious, others rather embarassing.
I recommend to wait before buying this still!

*edit 6: A big 15GB patch dropped (Friday, 07.04.). 
While the shader thing was done in less than a minute for me (I know, imagine my surprise!) the fps performance is still almost always abysmal. 
Especially in encounters (when entering an arena area, no matter if stealth or combat) the fps performance drops into a stuttery mess, also quite often when going upstairs in a room (walking around on ground level mostly fine, but damn you if you get up some stairs or ladders!)
Even on lower settings this is going on! (The reflections in mirrors & water look horrible, and several textures are extremely mushy...)
This is still far from good!

*edit 7: After the recent patch (May 2023), the performance is still far from perfect (at least sometimes it runs more fluent on lower settings), but the crashes seem to be back. 
At least this time it took a lot longer before I got a crash to desktop. 
Definetely still recommend to wait for a sale!

*edit 8: June 2023, a 25Gb patch at least stopped the crashes, but the performance is still lackluster, and hardly/rarely/occassionally getting up to 60 FPS and more, even with lower settings (which results in lots of ugly textures and weird glitches every now and then in return). 
At least it is playable for now...
Definetely only buy this game on a sale. Naughty Dog and Sony have not earned the right to get full price purchases anymore with this terribly botched launch!

*final edit: 
Almost half a year later, I have upgraded to a new graphics card (Sapphire AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT with 16gb VRAM and GDDR6 2438 Mhz) and for the first time ever I had a fluent performance, beautiful graphics and framerate. 
Even though I could finally now play the game properly, it doesn't change the fact that this PC port has been terribly botched and if you truly want to buy this game, WAIT FOR A SALE!

On a non-technical side, the save system is atrocious (a manual save does not actually save anything and instead keeps an auto-save available after it's overridden), which made me replay some parts because a collectible I picked before saving and quitting the game was not picked when I loaded the save later. 

At this point I suggest waiting until they stabilize the state the game is in before buying as apparently they can screw things with an update at any moment.

Original review:

After playing through the prologue and the 1st mission I experienced no crashes, no fps drops (only one drop to 28 fps in the first 2 minutes of the prologue) and no visual artifacts or other technical problems. I had locked the fps to 60 since that's my very-old's monitor refresh rate (and I didn't want to waste energy needlessly) so I can't really tell how high it would go and how stable it would be, but unlocking it for a few minutes I reached 240 fps in full HD.

Controls are not perfect but fine (hard to look from corners for example), the enemy AI is meh (on highest difficulty) as they tend to stand in the spot that you threw a distraction indefinitely for example. There is also telemetry that you can lower but not disable, although my firewall intercepts every outgoing connection and it did not try to connect even once during my gameplay.

As for the game itself, I played it on the PS3 emulator years ago so the story is very good (unlike part 2 which sucks).

I play on linux with GE-proton 7.53

Got the game as a AMD GPU bundle (not a paid promotion)."

The port to PC is horrible and while it's 'surprising' that my game doesn't crash as often, in a weird trade-off my game sessions actively deconstructs itself when playing. Here are a few examples (have tons but some key ones here):

While sneaking around and taking out Hunters, my surroundings start degrading pixel by pixel until the environment is one colorful mess. While Joel is interacting with other characters, his beard suddenly changes to a mix of bright green and purple which completely destroys the immersion. While walking around the characters face resolution lowers and increases back and forth - interesting stuff.

Do NOT buy the game in its current state until Naughty Dog fixes these and optimizes the game to a playable state. Absolutely disappointing and shocked at how bad this was done."

However I don't approve of games releasing in this state. It's been happening a lot in the recent years, from huge, popular games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Elden Ring, to smaller games set in specific franchises (Total War: Warhammer 3 and Darktide).
I'm worried about this trend of releasing games unfinished only to fix them on the fly later. It's not only working, but even spreading to most renowned developers, such as Naughty Dog.
That's why I cannot recommend this title as it is right now. Hell, I don't even recommend it at full price unless you're a huge fan or something. This much for a sloppy port of a one year old remaster of a ten year old game? You've got to be shitting me.

And how has Sony treated one of their most critically acclaimed series, on the platform that should be able to play it in the smoothest way possible, and with the highest fidelity? They have treated it like absolute garbage. This port is honest to god, garbo tier. My RTX 3080 with 16GB of VRAM can barely keep up with this thing. After trying hopelessly to adjust my settings to get a good performance to looks ratio, I'm still left with a low quality shimmering pixely mess, because running this thing at anything other than DLSS on performance mode tanks my FPS below 30FPS. And DLSS on performance nets me barely 40FPS. I refuse to play a 2013 PS3 game at anything less than 4K 60FPS in 2023, when I can do that with the vast majority of new games at high/ultra settings. Oh and the constant crashing. I've had about 7 crashes so far. Haven't had that so far for any games this year. Save your money, and make Sony think long and hard about how they treat their PC players, because they should be ashamed. I don't usually make reviews either on Steam, but this game has broken that trend, especially since I've been hoping for years that it would come to PC and to see it in this state now is honestly pretty devastating.

It looks gorgeous and this is the first time I have played the game (and I'm holding out to watch the series) so I find the story pretty phenomenal so far.  But I have gotten to play the opening to the title screen and steam things I already have 2 hours in the game.    Load times with a blazing NVME are ridiculous for me too.  Maybe that's just me because the reviews I have seen online look OK. There is no chance I would recommend paying $60 for this game unless you have something with a ton of VRAM or they patch this thing."

id wait till they patch the game. Its the same company that made one of the worst ports in history on steam, that batman game from like 2016. Which is good now, but ye. 

Wait for a bit till they fix it.
Lots of people wont be able to run at great settings and get really good fps no matter what, as most people dont even have a 2070 or above.
But theres something wrong if MY pretty decent cpu is getting maxed out 100% of the time and bottle necking a damn 1070 which is far worse than the cpu lol. 
I see hints of what my fps should be which is about 45 fps. But its mostly running pretty much capped at 30. Due to the fact my above average cpu is some how using literally every core to 100% Ive never seen that in a game, aside from battle field 2042. 
No matter what settings I pick, I dont lose or gain fps. Thats how you know its poorly optimized lol. (the only settings that effects fps for me, is reflections past low). 

Its  a 10/10 game, just on pc the optimization is terrible. Worse than cyberpunk by a mile in terms of performance. 
 
Idk why devs let a company with a track record of horrible ports to PC, port their game for them.
Its just dumb, 

TLDR, my 1070 shouldnt be bottle necked by a cpu thats above average lmao. Especially when the cpu for the ps5 is far worse than what I have, and runs the game flawlessly on ps5."

I pre-purchased the game about 2 weeks prior to its release, and downloaded it the day before. After it downloaded, it unpacked and installed. When I started the game, it took about ONE HOUR AND A HALF to build the shaders because it kept crashing.

When I was finally able to load the game, it looked great and I was starting to get excited and didn't mind the wait. When I get to use the first playable character something was amiss; the controls just felt funny. At first I thought it was due to the character waking up abruptly and had trouble walking, but still... I simply could not walk in a straight line. I staggered through to progress in the game until I was now playing with Joel and the same issue with the controls started again. I thought the issue was with my controller and tried using another and it was the same.

I then updated my AMD Adrenalin to version 23.3.2 because I thought this may be due to an outdated driver -- and when I open the game the shaders were in 0% again. I'm so f*****g PISSED. I spent quite a bit of money to get the Deluxe version and preloaded the game only to run into this. Although it shows that I've played 4.5 hours, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PLAY THIS GAME.

It's damaging to the image of companies like Sony and Nintendo, known for releasing polished products since launch day, to release half-baked ports with performance problems as severe as this. Excessively long shader compilation times, long loading screens, and high performance demands may not sound like complete dealbreakers at first, but it's BAFFLING to find out that not even THAT is enough to stop the game from running with insanely high CPU utilization, unstable frametimes, completely insane VRAM utilization for even Medium and Low settings, jagged mouse movements, and general stutters (all of that in an 8th gen i7, RTX 2080, 16GB of RAM, so for sure a PS5-like hardware).

This port is a complete diservice to the franchise and broken lauches like this will continue to happen as long as people keep pre-ordering them.

So why am I leaving a negative review? Well if you couldn't tell, like the rest of the reviews, this game has a major issue. 

Optimization. 

Lets start with my specs, I am currently running this on an Intel i9 13900K, an RTX 4090, and 64gb of Ram. The resolution set to 1440p on Ultra settings. This is more than enough.

For the most part, the game will run very smooth. But frames will drop drastically, with stutters every now and then. I like many others find this to be quite frustrating especially when it interrupts the flow of game play, and takes me out of the immersion.

That being said, this isn't a bash on the game itself a whole, as Naughty Dog and their team have created such a fantastic world to get lost in, this is only a bad review on the performance of the port. Predictable sure, but not excusable. I believe that those who have waited this long even after a delay deserve a better experience, especially those who are experiencing the game for the very first time. It also shouldn't require a nuclear reactor to run this game either.

As it stands, I plan to keep my review negative until optimization patches roll out and the performance of the game improves. I encourage others to do so as well."

OK, so this is a typical PlayStation console 'follow me' linear stuff, slow reactions, the game decides when you can have control of the character in fights, rinse and repeat long ass mob sections, being shouted at if you go the wrong way?? over and under steer, cant select the weapons quick enough (i don't use controllers btw)
Don't get me wrong, the story is great, its nice looking, there's a lot going on, but you cant do much.

but in typical console 'gamer' fashion, its 30% platform game and 70% cut scene. after 9 hours i think Days Gone is a wayyyy better game altogether.

I'll inevitably have to wait for a patch to fix the performance because currently, the experience is rather unenjoyable.

I get on avg <30 FPS and sometimes it goes as low as 15 FPS which causes massive freeze frames and stutters and makes the game borderline unplayable. My PC is still within the recommended specs range and should be able to run the game on at least medium with a stable 60 FPS.

I do not have the crashing issue many others experience, but the port is still more than unstable and no matter which settings I changed it didn't get better. Even on the lowest settings, I got no frame improvements at all.

It's not surprising to me but still a shame that the port for TLOU released in such a state and I'm genuinely disappointed as I was looking forward to replaying the game again on PC.

Once the game loaded, it lagged a little bit but not too bad in the intro. Once I got to [spoiler]the first shooting part with Tess[/spoiler] it froze but sorted itself out and was running fine afterwards. The occasional stutter here and there but nothing too game breaking. Hopefully these issues can be sorted out, if it's not my hardware.

Update: About 10 and a half hours into the game, was running fine-ish except from very big stutters towards the 8 hour mark, dropping me down to probably 1fps. At times it froze completely. I wouldn't recommend getting this game until the performance is fixed.

Limiting the FPS to 60 in Nvidia and in the game, as well as disabling chromatic aberration and film grain can help. Changing from full screen to windowed also helped with the performance, it's not a full fix but it's at least bearable now.

Another update:
It's running so smooth now, no lag spikes, no bugs, everything is perfect.

UPDATE 03/06/2023 - Still runs like balls for me. RTX3050... yes I understand what this is capable of. I have built custom builds (with full loops) for years and know the typical performance to expect from a gaming laptop. I run RDR2 mix med/high/ultra @1080p and get 60fps no sweat. At the same time I get this is an undervolted GPU (Laptop) and so cant expect wonders from every game. However.......

Standing in lane way with essentially all static objects and very little lighting streams or atmospheric, 0 NPC's should not mean running this game on full LOW settings and PERFORMANCE DLSS and be getting 30fps bouncing (low 25fps highs of 45pfs). 

My GPU max utilisation sits around 70% CPU 50% - meanwhile PC sounds like its going to melt (Temps getting towards 97'C). This is with latest drivers, reloaded shaders blah blah, all my other games run great - Horizon Zero Dawn runs smooth. 

Check out Digital Foundry's Youtube breakdown. Major problems with this port - not sure they will ever be full fixed - unless your lucky, or have a beefy GPU - im done with those days. Anyone justifying a $1000 GPU to run this is a sheep for the corp gaming mindset. Good luck. 

I'm done with this game. I actually broke my rule of never pre-ordering a game... I blame myself really. 

I literally threw away money with this - and the company knew it was a broken product. Imagine designing a fridge and selling it knowing it doesn't keep food cold... 

UPDATE: Waited  a few days and with two (small) patches I booted up again. 

Last time I didn't even get down the stairs, this time I got to the car with Tommy. At some point I imagine I will get to leave the house, this isn't a house simulator is it?..... Thanks - Wasted my money - Some of us have to work for it.

Sony must really think of pc players as scum to even consider making such a bad port, and then pricing it as a triple a game. not only was it an issue to playstation players when it first got announced, but its even more an issue now - this is a remaster of an already existing game, not a remake, its old asf, a port from playstation, and should not be $60. 

granted this game will probably bounce back, but right now it's pretty much impossible to comfortably play this game, i haven't gone without 10 minutes where there's a crash, it's embarassing. my pc setup isn't the worst, but its more than minimum (3070, i5 11th gen, 32GB) and for it to perform so badly on 1080p let alone high / medium settings is just stupid, its not to do with hardware being less powerful, but just developers being lazy and bad with their ports and optimisation. 

this port is not a port, its a hot steaming pile of shit
from the same port makers for batman:

- i crashed 20 times during only 1/3 of bills presence in the game, out of my 15 hours on the game, 5 is probably actual gameplay, the rest is verifying files, going afk or just dealing with graphics and settings
- game crashes constantly
    - i've had the game crash instantly upon loading
    - it crash in the menu
    - it crash during shaders
    - it crash as soon as i touch water
    - it crash as soon as i open my backpack
    - it crash as soon as i change my graphics
- the game is completely unoptimized 
- uses up too much ram 
- has bad frame timing 
- keyboard controls are inaccessible 
- dualsense haptics seem nerfed in the same way the spiderman ones were
- load times unrealistically long, as if you're using a hard drive.
    - loading so bad that you need to wait inbetween meant-to-be seamless transitions
- building shaders can take you 40m - 2hrs, voiding your refund rights.
- crashes can often cause issues with my whole pc, needing to restart.
- don't verify your files unless you're ok with waiting another hour to build shaders
- visual seems weirdly more grainy than the ps5 counterpart, combining that with sluggish at times and sped up at times fps, makes a really weird gameplay experience, thats if you can even play ofc."

The Last of Us is a story game. So let me tell you my story of it - or rather a PC port of it.

The Last of Drivers: I launch the game and it tells me my drivers are outdated - I need 22.40.43 ... err ... I'm using AMD 7900XT, what is that NVidia warning doing there?

The Last of Shaders: It took an hour to compile the shaders. Was checking how the game was utilizing my resources: all CPU cores/threads used, but drive speed was 10 mb/s ... on a 7000 mb/s capable M2! OK, they messed it up, but at least they allow to play the game while shaders are compiling in the background, right? Wrong: if you do that, the game crashes due to the same problem - IO disk speed bottleneck.

The Last of Loading: Shaders are finally compiled, I'm in the car with Joel and Tommy escaping the city and just when we reach the long queue of other cars ... loading screen! Very immersive. 

The Last of Controls: Finally proper gameplay, I'm in control of my character ... but the camera is totally broken! Same problem as in Uncharted : https://steamcommunity.com/app/1659420/discussions/0/5143704785452165725/ 
 and they never fixed it! I'm used with keyboard and mouse on PC. I played TLOU on PS4 with controller, same as I played RDR2. But on PC RDR2 is an enjoyment with KB&M - aiming is proper and it's incomparable (!!!) when you're in full control and not relying on that useless auto-targeting. TLOU on PC pushes haptic advertisement instead of making PC controls work properly. Camera stutters with the mouse to the point of inducing nausea.

The Last of Refunds: Will refund a game, though, I imagine that many people won't be able to because shader compilation and all the loading screen will take more that 2 hours for them to reach the actual playable section and realize it's in fact unplayable.

The Graphics of Us ... well, on 7900XT with 144Hz I'm running the game @90 to 100 FPS. All settings maxed out without using any kind of upscaling method ... that said, I was very puzzled when opening screeninfo.cfg game's configuration files  ... no wonder Naughty Dog is hesitant talking about their technology.

So what's The Result of Us? A broken game that is not set to use PC technology, with long loading times, mouse jitters and crashes (when you let shaders compiling in the background)"
5198,1,0.3406,"run, setting, pc, fps, performance, port, even, low, still, well","If you are actually interested in buying the game, please read my comments before spending any money.  I wish there was a ""Maybe/Depends"" option rather than just a thumbs up or down. 

First the good: The game looks absolutely fantastic! The graphics are top notch, I am very impressed with it overall.  Game play is a lot of fun.  I have to say it again, the graphics are absolutely beautiful.  I run it at 4k 60fps, and there are some areas where it looks almost real. If I was basing my recommendation on game play only, I would absolutely recommend this game.

Now the bad: When you first launch the game, it will hit your CPU at 100% while it is building shaders.  On my 12900k with a 3090 and 64gigs of system ram, this took about 25 - 30 minutes give or take; during this entire time your cpu will be at 100%.  So make sure you have a good CPU cooler...

From others I've heard of who have lower hardware, it can take an hour or so to complete building the shaders, but again I only heard this, I cannot confirm.

It's clear this game needs a major patch.  It has serious optimization problems.  For example, in the game setup, it says that it is using 15 gigs of vram on my video card (my 3090 has 24gigs of vram).  How the hell does a game like this need 15 gigs of vram?  That seems very un-optimized.   Reminds of of Ark from a few years ago, that was another game that was very unoptimised and used way more resources than it really should have.

Another issue is that the game is unstable.  Roughly every 30 minutes of game play it will crash.

So while the game itself is a lot of fun, and I can recommend it based on that, if you are planning to buy this game and expecting to play it right now, odds are you will be very unhappy.

This reminds of a lot of the issues with Cyberpunk 2077 when it released a few years back.   The game had major issues at release, and the developer got a lot of flak, but luckily they came thru and released several large patches to fix stability and game play issues.  Lets hope that Last of Us Part 1 also gets some serious patches soon.

Additionally it's incredibly buggy with the camera (right analog), sometimes it won't move for 5 seconds, sometimes it moves immediately but stops listening after 1 second, etc.

Even with it building a shader cache the game will drops FPS and stutter and I am using a GTX 1080TI with I7-8700k so running this game at high settings should not be a issue since this game is nine years old. If you looking to play this game on steam deck don't bother either since due the poor optimization it going to struggle running it a decent frame rate. This port should have been handle with care and you would think with the delay that was case to makes sure that the game was in a polish state. I would say hold on to your money wait a couple months and hope that they issue patch that properly optimize the game and only address the minor issues. It should not take to a hour to build a shader cache even resident evil 4 remake does not require you build a cache off boot really feel that is a way for developer to cut corner when it comes to optimizing the game.

i was really excited to play this  game. never made it past the first 2 hours on the PS3 and have been waiting for a PC version forever. resident evil 4 remake runs like a dream. high settings, normal raytracing, 60fps. constantly. the god of war and the spiderman port were both excellent, both different studios, but still playstation exclusives, so i felt good buying this. plus its naughty dog. the uncharted 4 port seemed to be well received as well. the only playstation port that ive played that was bad at launch is horizon.

i should absolutely know better than to preorder, but i was confident this game would come out running well. its 10 years old and has been remastered previously, it cant run that poorly. it does unfortunately. i made it to joels room as sarah before i crashed. ~10 minutes in. stuttering was pretty rough and i even noticed it in the main menu and on loading screens. i really hope they fix it soon, i was so excited to play. when i got a youtube notification at work that said ""the last of us part 1 pc port slammed by steam user reviews due to buggy unoptimized launch"" i almost fell to my knees. in this state i absolutely cannot recommend it in this state. god damn it.

update 1: as of the 29th of April, this game is playable finally. certainly not optimal though, on my 3060ti and i5-9600k with 32gb of ram, i am hitting a consistent 40-50fps, occasionally it hits 60 for maybe a few seconds in a building or something, occasionally it dips to 30 but not for too long. i can play and have been, but its not at all finished and even when it will be i am not changing my negative review out of principle. companies gotta learn to stop with the garbage quarter baked PC ports.

update 2: i dont remember when exactly but a couple months ago I finished the game and the DLC and it ran well, finally. so it should be in a solid state at this point but I can only confirm that with my own personal setup.

1. My ""play time"" exceeded  two hours because the game took so long to load. The shadders that are required were taking so long I had to leave the  program running over night to allow sufficient  time for them to be applied. This accumulated the majority of the  11+ hours Steam claims I played the game.  

2. I did not submit a return claim within  14 days. This is the weirdest part since I pre-purchased the game over a month before it was release. This means that ANYBODY who  pre-purchases a game 14 days in advance in simply SOL (Shit out of luck). According to the Steam return policy. 

In the end I told them them I will not submit to their denial of my refund and I was completely justified in wanting a refund on a product they allowed to be released un-optimizes on their platform.

Update: I left the game running all night to load the shaders because they were taking so long. I THEN WAS ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME. With immense stuttering and atrocious load times.I struggled to make it to the 
 Slums portion of the game, having to wait several times for the game to load. Sometimes five plus minutes. This is when the game began to crash. I tried several times to make it past to no avail. With the amount of time you have to wait simply to play the game, then all the issues you run into when actually playing, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Absolutely terrible, I will be requesting a refund. I want my money back. In the two hours Steam claims I've played this game, I've been waiting. Waiting for shaders, waiting for loading screens. At one point I timed the initial loading screen at well over five minutes, only for the loading wheel to be at 1/4 completed. My system specs are slightly above minimum requirements to ""play the game"" yet in those two hours I literally played 0% of the game. This is extremely disappointing, I've always heard TLOU is an awesome game and after watching the show, I was really looking forward to play this game. With the amount of time waiting for this game to load it's honestly not worth it, and I will not upgrade my system with several hundreds of dollars of hardware to play one game. It would probably be cheaper to buy an older Play Station to play this game. I've only really seen people with really high end machines being able to play the game, if that is even true. From what I've seen almost everybody that bought this game is having issues. Maybe the issues will be addressed and I'll be able to play, most likely I'll just be getting a refund if I can.

I'll update this and let you guys know if it's any better after some updates/patches come out whenever that may be in the future!

However, being one of the lucky few doesn't exonerate the myriad of problems that other users have seemed to have with this port. Poor ports are simply not an excuse in the modern landscape of gaming, especially so with groundbreaking games that have been gated behind single platform exclusivity for a decade. Naughty Dog's ""acknowledgement"" of the issue and promise of a fix is a clear bandage for a wound they saw coming miles away - don't be fooled into believing they didn't know the state of the port prior to release. They absolutely did, and were willing to sell the product as is.

Let me be clear - I LOVE TLoU, and have played every release of it thus far. It severely pains me to dissuade people from playing this wonderful game. The remake is stunning and really elevates the experience, but even under that hood the game as it was is an incredible journey that really pushed the boundaries of storytelling in the gaming format. By right, this port deserves more respect. Hopefully, Naughty Dog will fix this port and Iron Galaxy will get their shit together so I can change this review in the future. But for now, my heart goes out to PC gamers everywhere who have been severely wronged by the corporate greed machine."

I was running this game on the lowest settings on Omen 17 Laptop, 3060 RTX, i7 11800H, 64GB RAM and the vRAM was at 105%. The optimisation is subpar and graphics looked as poor as you can imagine.
The second problem, and this might apply to me alone, is that the movement of the character was too slow, lazy somehow, as they probably kept the same mechanics that you would see on a console. It was frustrating to see your character running in slow-motion while chased by zombies.

I've never been a fan of the genre, I am not into zombies but I do love a good post-apocalyptic survival scenario. This wasn't it.

5365,0,0.3053,"story, last, also, character, gameplay, feel, instead, present, hype, find","Post-launch day review:

Sooo I've beaten the game now. I guess there was some sort of memory leak that they patched after day one, seemed to fix things a lot. Another problem people faced (myself included) was being a little impatient and not waiting for the game to ""build shaders"" prior to actually playing. This process seems to of taken some people 10 minutes, it took me just under 3 hours, and for some it took even longer.

Once this shader nonsense was over with, the game played much better. Load times were drastically decreased, and FPS stability was improved. I still feel however, that the game is poorly optimized. I'm running a GTX 1070 (8GB) which isn't insane by today's standards, and even on low settings I can not maintain a stable 30FPS (god forbid I try higher).

Ignoring my gripes about performance, the game itself is not bad. But I don't really see why it's revered as a masterpiece. That being said, there are so many unique good things the game has accomplished that other game's have not managed to grasp.

I'll keep it brief here. Atmospherically the game is perfection every step of the way. Graphics can be stunning on a high end computer. The stealth mechanics are pretty good, and the way the game forces you into different situations is great too. The game's mechanics itself leave more to be desired. This isn't call of duty, but gunplay can be a little frustrating (funny enough the game has a built in aim-bot under options somewhere). The gore in the game is on point, super entertaining. Blood splatters and bleeds out of people accurately, and bullets leave accurate exit wounds and chunks of flesh on the wall/ground. It's very satisfying to cut someone in half with a shotgun, or remove the jaw of some shit-talking enemy with a well placed shot; that alone is a feeling of satisfaction second to none. But this game is more focused on telling it's story as opposed to its gameplay.

That brings me to the story. I won't spoil anything obviously, but I just felt it did not live up to the hype my peers had put behind it. Was it bad? I wouldn't say that. Also despite steam suggesting I have 24 hours played, between waiting for shaders to build and other AFK time I only got about 16 hours of story at most. It's just not long enough.

Overall prognosis; buy it on sale. Better yet, buy it on sale on console.




Launch Day Review:

I have waited 10 years to be able to play this game, and in it's current state it will take me another 10 years to complete this game. Graphically the game can lovely, but even on low settings the constant fps dips are extremely frustrating.

It took me 3.5 hours to encounter my first Clicker, due to the extremely long load times of literally everything. This game is unplayable as is for me, and many other players. I have long since stopped purchasing new games, because I am often disappointed. For a remaster of a game of this prestige, it's very upsetting that the developers would put out such a shameful rerelease.

Do not buy. Not yet anyway."

As such I will keep this spoiler free, but I would like to say as well, that this review and its conclusions will likely only be valid until the developer addresses the games technical problems.

PC Platform reviewed on:

Core i9 12900K
GeForce RTX 3080/3090
Samsung 980 PRO PCIe Gen 4 SSD

Graphical Uplift.

I will say that when it plays well it's very impressive and looks incredible, the resolution uplift over the original is stark to say the least. The graphical uplift is pretty incredible characters are crisp, and if you have the VRAM for it (greater than 10GB) the textures are beautifully crisp too. 

Technically speaking...

But the technical problems are incredible. Just incredible. For me they started immediately upon launch, The games executables resulted in an immediate Anti Virus detection that saw the games primary launch executable being quarantined. After I took the executable out of quarantine and created an exception  for it, the game called a DLL that resulted in another Anti-Virus detection. Another exception was created and the file was moved out of quarantine. 

After this the game started and spent approximately 45 minutes building it's shaders. I'm glad that titles like this do this once at the beginning, pre-compiled shaders are a great idea, they improve performance by eliminating real time Shader compilation during gameplay. That in turn eliminates stuttering and frame rate reductions when content needs to be streamed into the game engine for rendering, it can make a significant reduction in overhead.

At least, that's the idea. The reality is that the shaders are indeed compiled, but the game freezes, stutters and experiences significant frame rate drops during play regardless and there appears to be little logic to when and why this happens. It's so inconsistent that I can't believe that this has been through an optimisation pass.

As we play the situation becomes more pronounced. The frequency with which freeze's occur increases as does the stutter and hitching I'm thinking a potential  memory leak maybe? After a couple of hours of play I entered a building where we first encounter ""Spores"" and have to place masks on while exploring the building. I eventually reached a point where we arrive in what appears to be a basement laundry room, and another frame hitch/stutter event occurred. The game was frozen but I could hear the dialogue between the characters still playing. After a few moments the screen went blank and I was dropped to the desktop with a request to post an error report.

I filled in the error report, but the crash report utility integrated into the game, resulted in another Anti-Virus detection which saw the utility being quarantined and the report go nowhere. Sorry Iron Galaxy but your port is triggering Anti Virus alerts, you really need to check that out.

It is at that point I felt... this product needs more work and I gave up. 

Why didn't I add an exception to the games installation directory before I started? Because it shouldn't be necessary. Most modern PC's now run some form of Anti-Virus that is integrated into the OS. Some people use a purchased product that they trust instead (I said Trust, not McAfee). In my case I use an AVG Business licence that is fully up to date.  I imagine however, that if the product wasn't tested by the developer against AVG (one of the most popular AV products there is) then I doubt it was tested with others. Make sure you add exceptions to your Anti-Virus product to accommodate this title until the AV detection problems are dealt with.

100+ button controller players! (I mean your keyboard)

I have also encountered a UI design issue that is really quite annoying, basic user interface prompts. During play if you are close to an object you can interact with, the game will display the key you should press to interact with the object. So lets say it's 'E' you walk up to the object press 'E' and you could be reading a newspaper. But you don't use 'E' to stop interacting with the object, you use 'back.' Back? There is no 'Back' button on a keyboard, Do you mean the down arrow? Do you mean the button I have configured to walk backwards? Oh right, you mean backspace? Seriously? Why not use the button used to interact with the object in the first place? It's a minor gripe, but it's an annoying one. The user interface could be clearer and controls a little more consistent.

Technicalities

With respect to the system I ran this on, there is no question of the available processing, RAM and SSD transfer capability. The only component that lets the iniitial configuration down is the initially tested Nvidia GPU I used, which Nvidia gimped with an insufficient quantity of vRAM. Now I don't blame Naughty Dog/Iron Galaxy for that, I blame Nvidia for that, however it does highlight a fact, that the game itself definitely loves vast quantities of vRAM. So a 10Gb frame buffer is going to result in graphical fidelity compromises. Some of that may be down to the clear lack of optimisation, but the core problem here is still nVidia's own failure to deliver a sufficiently specced product during the 3080's launch.

Having said that I have tried the game on a 3090 with 24GB of vRAM and found, the same in game stutters and performance issues and the same crashes straight to desktop. So at least a significant percentage of the issues encountered are VERY DEFINITELY down to the optimisation and the stability of the title.

Conclusions

I have played The Last of Us on the PS3 and PS4 previously. And I am familiar with the content. I can say that the PC version is a faithful port of the game. And for that I am grateful. BUT I absolutely can't recommend a buy for this game just yet. 

Once again we're beta testing a product. Beta testing a product that is now 10 years old. There's no question about the content and quality of the story here. But the current implementation is lacking. I strongly advise customers to wait for a performance and optimisation patch. Iron Galaxy, who handled the port were also responsible for producing the Uncharted port for the PC too. They were very quick to respond and address problems related to that title.

Give it a little time, maybe in a month or two months time this game will be patched and ready, but today? It really isn't."

It's a setup that just let me play Plague Tale: Requiem, a game similar in style and mechanics to TLOU 1 + 2 (but with even better graphics) at upwards of 100 FPS at all times on max settings. I was previously playing RDR2 with 4K textures which took about 6-7GB of VRAM. Cyberpunk 2077 on Ultra needs about 8GB of VRAM. This setup crushes anything I throw at it, and can do full raytracing on most games at 80+ FPS with only minor graphical setting compromises. Hogwarts Legacy runs like a dream.

I'm getting under 30 FPS on the MENU SCREEN. The game defaulted to medium/low settings and was at almost 8GB of VRAM usage off the bat. I can't select Fullscreen as there's no option. Shader cache is building and currently at 25% as of this writing... I pop open Task Manager to see what's going on, and my CPU usage is at 100 fucking percent! On the MENU! Who greenlit this garbage?

Literally unplayable, and unironically so. Couldn't have imagined a AAA port releasing like this in 2023...

EDIT: I, as always, let the shaders compile before trying to play. I did the Oodle 'fix' mentioned on Reddit and here. As soon as I tried to open the bedroom door, the game crashed. Alright.. I turn down settings a bit (which I should NOT have to do) and try again. FPS is slightly better this run, I make it to the stairs and boom - crash again, within 45 second of loading in. At this point I will just go for the refund and buy RE4 remake instead. I won't sit through 3 minute load screens just to crash within a minute because of shit optimization. I have a friend playing on a 4090 having the same issues, so it's clearly not about ""upgrade your specs"" or ""fix your PC"".

The Game is still a mess, it doesn't crash anymore thanks to the patches but the Mouse movement is still extremely jittery(I play on 400DPI so it's not me), the game's performance is still extremely lack lustre and my PC isn't exactly low end.

Playing in DLSS doesn't do anything, it just makes the game and characters look worse and I barely see a difference in FPS when it's enabled.

Looks like we need more patches for performance sake.

---------------------------------------------------------------

I’m am getting sick and tired of PC ports releasing in this state. I love how they delayed it too, looks like that delay didn’t help at all and we still get a broken mess. 

If you really do like your Money then why won’t you just release the game in a good state? When games are released like this, people just refund it or refuse to buy it then your game is left to be a shit stain of a port forever no matter how much it gets fixed. Releasing games like this actually hurts YOU Sony and your reputation.

I’ll still play it once the game is fixed but, this means i have to wait another few Months for the patches. You were better off delaying the game again…"

Before I expand on my experience with this game, I'll give up my gaming rig specs to hopefully give other players an idea if their machines are the problem or not(it isn't, it's awful optimisation..)

i9 12900KS
ROG Maximus Z690 Hero Motherboard
32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 5600 Memory
2 x 1TB SAMSUNG 980 PRO M.2, PCIe NVMe(OS on the main, games on the other)
12GB ASUS ROG STRIX GEFORCE RTX 3080 Ti
Windows 11
Sony Bravia 4k TV 53 Inch(I can get the model number if needed but I don't think the TV is the issue..lol)

This has been a weird mix of great performance with a solid frame rate and crashing every fifteen minutes with no rhyme or reason. I dived in with my optimist hat on trying a 4K DLSS Quality Ultra run and to be honest it was fairly solid with a smooth 60FPS initially. I didn't have any crashes in my first hour of playing but as soon as I hit the spot where the first lot of spores and combat kicked in, I knew that I was being over ambitious with my settings(on purpose with a string of hope). I really wanted to keep the Ultra settings going so I dropped down to 1440P DLSS Quality at Ultra.... To be honest it was running great and was super smooth and this lasted for a good ninety minutes and I was enjoying the game immensely. The last hour of my four hour playtime was a different story. I was still getting the smooth and nice game play as described earlier but I had eight crashes in the space of fifty minutes. I tried a few graphic downgrade options but to be honest that didn't fix anything so as of now I am not going to bother playing any further.

I am guessing that patches will come and hopefully we can play this game without the strife that a good few of us have at the moment. In the meantime, I personally will not buy another PlayStation Studio game on PC  unless it has been ported by Nixxes(I believe PlayStation bought this studio), they seem to be the studio that knows what they are doing. I hope they are the ones that will port Ghosts of Tsushima as that is what we all really want.

Thanks for your time anyway. I'll revisit this if it gets patched and the crashes are fixed and update it accordingly. 

Cheers,

Kalizto"

It was obvious this would be the case when the game was delayed, so reviewers were allowed to play it, and the required specs were so freaking high. 

DON'T buy the game in this state unless your PC is pretty beefy. I'm so sick of studios releasing unfinished games."

Like don't get me wrong, I've gotten used to shoddy PC ports over the last while, but this is just purely unacceptable. ESPECIALLY when this is a game that is considered to be one of the best games of all time, and an absolute must play by anyone who has played and enjoyed it. I would rather boot up my PS4 and play the old version of this at 30fps, or of course play the new updated/remastered version on Ps5 even though it was more of a cash grab than a remaster in my opinion. But this is seriously, seriously, terrible. I run a 3060 and a 5700xt and even with trying all forms and options of DLSS and FSR 2, it was nearly impossible to even hit a steady framerate at upscaled resolution. I was so much looking forward to finally being able to play this gem of a game on PC, but instead what I got is probably the saddest excuse for a PC port in a long while, and that is REALLY saying something.
Makes it all the worse that most of Sony's ports have ranged from pretty great to basically perfect. Games like Spider-Man, God of War, Miles Morales, Horizon, Death Stranding, Days gone....ALL of them have had great ports that you can tell had a lot of care put into them, and you really felt like you were playing an upgraded experience. With this port, the ONLY thing that is upgraded is the graphics. But even if you bump them down to low, the performance is still terrible, and you could spend 3 minutes standing looking at a road sign just for it to not render in the letters.
I'm sure experiences will vary, and I'm sure that people out there with a 4070+ and a monster CPU can probably get this game to run at a smooth framerate. Maybe. But the fact that I have a rig that should theoretically push me through the next generation of gaming and puts out significantly more power than a next gen console, that can barely run a remaster of a decade old game, shows some serious problems with this game's optimization. 
I've comfortably pre ordered all of SIE's PC ports so far, but this was a great reminder that pre ordering is always the wrong idea, even if the publisher has a good track record."

 I'm very hurt that I have to leave a 'Not Recommended' review on this title. 
For One Thing, The Last of Us is GD [b]Masterpiece[/b] and if you have never had the chance to play it then go get if for PS5 or PS4. Clarifying that this 'Negative' Review is not about TLoU but rather THIS port. I'm also very willing to do an updated review if/when they fix these issues...and there are quite a few issues...
  I pre-ordered this game, and I also paid for the deluxe version because I love the original so much. I didn't even care about the extra gun skins, I just wanted to show my love and help support Naughty Dog because generally I love their games. Also a huge fan of UC and all their old school titles as well. So Yea...I feel very betrayed, I would have happily waited longer for a FINISHED GAME! I mean....Its not like I don't have other amazing games to play/ Stream. Oh and....damn almost wasn't able to stream the game either. So let's talk about my experience as of this review (day 1 launch)
  (OK about a day and half before actually) So my buddy and I who have been non-stop talking about this game do the pre-download and then notice....there are absolutely no reviews...Did they not give out review copies? It should have been a red flag, but I was too excited. To paint a full picture I even spent over $1500 to do a 4080 upgrade, new PSU and more RAM (not for this game specifically, but It was one i wanted to play), and have had an excellent experience with games on full graphics while streaming even! And then 3/28/23 rolls around and its not until 9AM central that it unlocks with, surprise! another update.
  So now we are caught up to the day one launch. I open the game and before I play, it tells me that I need to wait for the shaders to load...OK...fair....but an hour to load them? I then played through the Intro and wasn't able to break 70 frames....AND I WANT TO CLARIFY that I would have been OK with 60 frames if it was stable. However, that wasn't the case, several times it would drop in the 40's or hang in the 50's. My friend actually had 20's at this point. Once i cleared the Intro I closed the game for a bit and then went back to mess with graphics. And I had it running at about 70 for most of it. 
  I feel like, OK maybe people were exaggerating a bit on the reviews, but I still agree that it should have been better. That is...Until I decided to stream it, which I had already let everyone know last week I was going to do and even made promos for. I was showing everyone that the reviews were not looking hot but we were going to try to stream it, and that I had a lot of confidence in it because of my pre-run earlier.  So I clicked Launch Game live on stream and it seemed to work.
  The loading screen came on and I was talking about the shaders, but in this case they were loaded, so I went to start a new game and CRASH!!!! I tried 4 more times but it wouldn't open. I ended stream so I could restart the whole PC and when I came back Steam wouldn't open. I had an awesome viewer that helped me do a verification thing on it that allowed it to open, and we were then able to stream it but had to wait until the shaders (that have had to load 3 times now!) to install again. We played up until Joel, Ellie, and Tess make it out of the sewers and on to the city. 
  During the stream it was extremely rare that I got 70 frames, much less 60. The average was 43 and there were several sections that dipped to 20-30....and ugh....it gave me a headache. Yes I was irritated, but I mean i got an actual head ache trying to play. I missed a bunch of shots or had to check things out slowly to not miss anything. I was even playing on medium graphics. For comparison I have been streaming A Plague Tale: Innocence on my new GPU at Ultra Graphics (Beautiful Game BTW-Highly Recommend) and the stream looks crisp and I'm always at a stable 75 FPS and sometimes a bit more even with the hordes of rats on screen. 
   In Conclusion: The Last of US is a wonderful game that will make you laugh, cry, and FEEL for these characters like no other game has done before. If you have not experienced it you NEED to! That being said, go play it on a PS5, and if you don't have one, play it on PS4, and if you don't have one of those and PC is your only option and that's why you have been waiting, please save your money and wait until they fix this. I know a lot of people complaining about the price, and with the current issues...I don't blame them, BUT If this port was a True remaster something you could play/stream at 60+ FPS and have better graphics then when it first came out $60 or even $70 is well worth the price!
  I personally won't be refunding it, because I want to keep bug testing and let them know what to fix. This game deserves to be enjoyed by everyone, and damn I want to enjoy it on my PC! 
  Thank you for your time!"

They delayed the launch for an extra three weeks to “optimize it for a wider range of systems.” In the end, they optimized it for NO SYSTEMS. Neil Druckmann even promised Steam Deck compatibility and the game’s technical issues prevent it from even running good of Deck

The issues stem from several key issues: Shader compiling is way too long. Call of Duty does not take this long to compile shaders. At minimum you’re looking at 90 minutes to compile the shaders, don’t even bother trying to play the game unless the shaders are compiled otherwise it’ll be unplayable

Second issue: it happened again mouse aim is choppy. You’d think they’d learn from when Uncharted had that issue but apparently not.

Third issue, crashing. Even with an SSD there’s moments the game just stops working right

Fourth issue, lack of gyro aim and issues with Steam Input. I am a firm proponent of motion control aiming for gamepads. From playing Splatoon I know gyro aim is objectively better than sticks. With mouse aim broken I wanted to turn gyro aim on with my Dualsense. The game doesn't have gyro aim (which is still stupid the majority of Playstation games don't have this feature) so I gotta open Steam Input settings to turn gyro aim on. Here's the thing: By default, the game disables Steam Input whatsoever. If you have a Dualsense connected it will turn it off and you cannot access Steam controller settings at all, which is absolutely asinine. So I back out of the game to turn Steam Input on, to which the game gives me a popup saying that the Dualsense's settings of the adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, and touchbar and light bar settings, won't work at all if Steam Input is on. Naughty Dog...are you kidding me? SPIDERMAN REMASTERED HAS GYRO AIM AND STEAM INPUT SETTINGS AND THE DUALSENSE FUNCTIONS STILL WORK! 

And of course fifth issue as mentioned before: the game on Steam Deck will not run at all despite Naughty Dog promising it would, AND VALVE ADVERTISING THE GAME FOR DECK

Hold the hell off until it gets fixed, and spend your money somewhere else, like Resident Evil 4 Remake, a remake that adds new content and isn’t a mess like this is. This is an absolute embarrassment and a tarnishing of the good will Playstation PC built up, and also a black mark on Sony’s flagship game The Last of Us, the game that won and still does win numerous Game of the Year awards and made an incredible impact on the industry that is still felt today.

EDIT: After two patches shader building is a lot faster so that part is taken care of at least, for the most part. It's now at a point that I can play it. However, it is still not in a good place for you to buy it. There's still stuttering issues, mouse aim is still broken and doesn't work right, and there's still a lot of optimization to do. This is really heartbreaking that the game was launched in this state. This is Sony's biggest game, and they left it in such a sorry state, presumably to rush it out the gate after the hype of the HBO show."

The story is amazing, the game play great, so why the negative review? Simple - it runs like dog water and they changed little details all over the game. I didn't personally think this game needed a remake. It just needed a PC port of the remaster. A perfect remake IMHO is Resident Evil 2. I'm a little ways into the game now and the amount of changes that add nothing to the game is crazy. Little details are removed and it just feels odd to someone that !00% the remaster and has 100s of hours in it. Like an AI picture of a person yeah the picture is there but why does it feel off? Why did they need to change Ellie's face? Just leave this game alone and stop trying to milk the community for more money, Bottom line this should have just been a PC port of the remaster.

PERFORMANCE ISSUES:

TLOU Part 1 has very bad performance and crashes pretty often. I crashed probably 13 or 14 times through my entire play through. Also absolutely insanely long load times. Compiling shaders takes an hour and I've had to do it 4 times now. First time startup, verify game files, new drivers, new drivers again. Loading into your save takes an insane amount of time too. I have the game installed on a m.2 SSD and it takes 50-60 seconds. Like something has to be broken.

My Hardware:
Ryzen 7 5800x
32gb 3200mhz
RTX 3060ti
M.2 SSD

The game ran at 60 frames at medium settings set to DLSS quality at 1440p. The performance is that bad. I was able to replace a .dll file in the game directory that made the frames jump to about 80 but it was still pretty bad and I should never have to do that. If you have a high end PC you might be able to just brute force your way through the performance issues, but if you have a low to mid range PC you're going to have some problems.



ACTUAL GAME REVIEW:

All that being said I pushed through and beat the game because it's genuinely that good. Fantastic story, incredibly immersive world, the best video game characters I've ever seen, great writing, fun combat, beautiful graphics. Like it's all just extremely well done.
I've always been a fan of dark, gritty, harsh, realistic stories. Doesn't matter if its a video game, movie, or TV show and this game fulfills that itch perfectly. Most games don't really hit me emotionally but I wont lie, some moments got me. The performances from the characters are that believable. That's even coming from someone that knows most of the major beats of the game. I knew how the game ended, I knew what would happen to certain characters, and it still got me.
I also underestimated the game play. I assumed the combat was just ""shoot people"" with occasional looting sections. I was wrong. The enemy AI is actually very good. When in combat you can lose line of sight with the enemy and flank around to other positions and the levels are made just for that. It's also super important because they don't give you a whole lot of ammo. Most weapons top out at 15-20 rounds. That means you have to utilize the molotovs, bombs, smoke bombs, and melee weapons at your disposal.

I'm seriously debating whether or not I want to make this review positive or negative, but I think I'm going to leave it negative because Sony needs to know that this level of port is not acceptable despite the game being fantastic. Once the game is in a good state I'll change my review to positive. Hyped to go watch the show now because I was waiting to play the game first."

I have been waiting for this game to drop for a long time and the time has finally come! But when I opened it, CRASH!!
This game is ported so poorly that even the Y axis of left joystick  is not working on my controller. I had to strafe left/right If I need to move.
And the CPU utilization is so bad that I can fry beef on my CPU right now. 
I waited for an hour for the game to build shaders while crashing in the main menu every 5 minutes. The game crashed again after I completed the prologue and now I decided to wait till the next update.

Lets just say this port is a fucking joke.

It hurts to say that i wont recommend playing this game.

After a two hour wait to finish building shaders i knew i was ready to go.

Starting a new game and ready to play after about a ten minute loading screen i finally get that first cinematic cutscene. And...... Crash....

Oh well no biggie lets just start it up again whats the worst that could happen?

Oh... i got to build shaders again? Wtf? i gotta wait another two hours to play the damn game?

I said fuck that. So i continue on still building shaders. and i know. performance will take a toll i get it. but once i finally get it after the great cinematic cutscene i hear Sarah's broken voice talking to Tommy. and a wapping 20 fps!!! hell yeah..... 

I hope they fix this very soon. I love this game beat it multiple times on the PS3/4/5 this game definitely deserved better.

Whoever made this port doesn't know how to program, optimize or test. I cannot get a consistent frame rate, the game looks terrible and somehow eats up a ton of resources. I've played plenty of better looking games on higher quality settings and not experienced the pure frame dropping and low resolution.

Honestly, I would forgive all of that, because a game doesn't need to run amazingly to be a fun experience or tell a great story. What it does need however, is to give me control over my player character. Both analog sticks suffer from some kind of issue. The cardinal directions are basically useless and you won't move while pointing in those directions, weirdly diagonals seem to work more often, but it's not exactly a fun experience to wiggle between up+right/down+right to get your camera aimed (not at where you're going) but off to the side so you can run at a diagonal toward it.

I couldn't even get beyond the introduction sequence, I kept getting bitten by zombies while trying my best to finagle my way through with the bad camera controls and movement. I realized it's not going to be worth it to try to play this game, so I'll be refunding. It feels really lame that this game can't even get movement correct.

installed newest Nvidia drivers because that's a pretty logical step at this point

Building shaders... Crashes after a few minutes (notably, right around when it hits 10gb of system memory usage, I had 60% more free)
Attempt 3 more shader builds, all crash within 5 minutes.
Attempt to just load into the game and let the shaders build while the game runs. Crashed while loading.
Gave it two more attempts to load the shaders on the menu before calling it.

So having played the game on ps4, I am sure this review would change if/when this is patched. As it is, I was already iffy about paying 60$ for a game I had already played years ago, but with the hype around the show I decided to take the plunge. Now I think I may be asking for a refund.

Edit: 

After being convinced that the game was in a playable state, I bought it again after refunding. Massive mistake. Naughty Dog must have bots all over the internet. Once I reinstalled the game I cant get 5 minutes in without crashing. This is absolutely ridiculous and we should be able to file class actions against developers who pull this shit.

extremely high CPU usage during gameplay

1st patch fixed nothing

As much as I like this game it’s a really bad port. The frame rate is very inconsistent due to the very high cpu usage and the way the game streams it’s assets. This leaves no room for the GPU to communicate with the CPU which results in very poor performance.

There’s also lag when using a controller which makes aiming and movements feel off and can become frustrating when you need to make small precision movements. I’ve also read there seems to be issues with mouse control as well.

I never preorder games but I felt this one was a safe option as naughty dog studio normally delivers high quality games. This was not one of them. I’ve learned my lesson to not break my own rule and always wait for reviews.

Unless they miraculously fix this game I would avoid buying it

Experience the thrill of choppy framerates, stuttering cutscenes, and random crashes that will keep you on the edge of your seat (or angrily pounding your desk). And if you're lucky, you might even get to experience some bonus graphical glitches that will make your characters look like they're straight out of a Salvador Dali painting!

Sure, the gameplay and story are still top-notch, but who needs a smooth experience when you can have a heart attack-inducing one instead? So if you're looking for a game that will make you question your decision to ever invest in a high-end gaming rig, look no further than The Last of Us PC port. It's an experience you'll never forget (or maybe never finish because it keeps crashing).

Im running the game on high, So my fps is trash averaging at 30fps. and some how using 7.9gbs out of my 8gbs of VRAM. Not to mention the games poor optimization and my CPU being MAXED at 100% as soon as i start the game. The only reason im able to slightly play the game is because im using a xbox controller.

I love The Last Of Us, Never played it  before, but I've watched my fave YouTuber play it. I recently watched the show, and was so excited to finally be able to play it, so I stupidly pre-ordered it, knowing the state of how AAA games release in the past decade. 

But I was like ""This is one of sony's biggest IP's, surely they won't f**k it up"".

Launch came, spent an hour unpacking the preload, then another 2 building shaders, only to get stuttering, crashes and frames in the 20's when I finally entered the game. I am sorely disappointed. I've asked for a refund. Guess I won't play the last of us after all. I'll buy an old ps3 and a second hand copy, cos with the way iron galaxy handled the uncharted port, I have no faith. 

Either

1) They play tested, knew it was s**t and released it anyway because greed. 

Or 

2) They didn't play test it, and released it. 

Either way it's a s**tty thing to do, and your reputation is tarnished. 

Thanks Naughty Dog and Iron galaxy, for making the worst PC port I've seen. I should've known to not pre-order.  When I get my refund I'm buying the RE4 remake, since it launched in a playable state.

The game is still riddled with bugs and glitches that can ruin your gameplay. The performance is slightly better and finally it doesn't force you to wait for the shaders each startup. The AI still has problems, sometimes they just get stuck in a box and start to throw it back. :D Sometimes they cheat through the wall (hardest difficulty).

The narrative is still very well written and the cast makes a terrific job with mocap and voice acting, but this alone sadly can't make it right, that the PC port was (and is) still bad.

On top of that during gameplay the game will freeze and say ""Please Wait"" for 20 seconds or so. That happened 3 times during the prologue level.

After the prologue end the second level Again took another 4-5 minutes to load after maybe 20 minutes of gameplay or so, and there were still those ""Please Wait"" mini loading screens during gameplay.  Tried deleting save and restarting (everything) and well... 2nd verse, same as the first.

Performance seemed fine when I was in the game, although the framerate didn't seem as smooth as what my FPS counter was saying (prob averaging around 70fps or so, dips to 50 and raises to 90's on a 6700xt - 10600k - Nvme SSD at autodetected high/ultra settings).

Sony should have pulled this the moment they saw its performance I barely made it 5 min into the start of the game before giving up. Here are some of the issues I ran into during this short playtime:
[list]
[*] Upon opening the game I had to wait [b]45[/b]minutes for the shaders to download I understand this process isn't supposed to be that fast but there are game with much better graphics that take a quarter the time to do this
[*] Even after letting the shaders load the game still took about 2 minutes to load the first level then took another 2 when I skipped the first cutscene.
[*] The reason I skipped the first cutscene is because the character models were constantly shifting between what they were supposed to do and T posing/sliding this was true for all 4 cuscenes I tried to watch.
[*] On top of the last point when the characters were doing the right animations the sound was completely desynced along with the facial animation being almost completely wrong the entire time.
[*] The T posing/sliding issue wasn't only for cutscenes they also plagued any gameplay with NPCS
[*] I didn't make it to any combat but I have to believe that if these issues were even half as bad during those they would be unplayable.

It took about 10mins to get through only 8% of shader building and then it hard crashed to desktop. And then again. And again. All I did was leave it at main menu to build shaders.

I completed TLOU many times on PS3, PS4 and PS5 before.

Upon launching the PC version, I was greeted with an immediate crash. I updated all the drivers, restarted my computer and tried again.
When I reached the main menu, CPU usage immediately rose to 100% and stayed there as the shader building process started. I tried changing some settings and got booted out of the game again. Retried, and as soon as the shader compilation reached about 5%, Windows reported that it's totally out of memory and the game completely froze my computer to the point where I had to hard reset.
I tried launching it again, and the shader compilation got to 8% when my PC completely froze again.

So after nearly half an hour of waiting all I got was a few crashes and hard resets. Never had any sort of issues running other games, including RDR2 on the highest settings.

This is the worst PC port I've ever seen in my life so far. Do not buy this game on PC, not yet at least. Sorry, Sony/ND, but there is NO excuse for letting TLOU get the worst PC port in the history of video games.
If you have a spare PS3/4/5 lying around, I recommend trying the game there.

I had this pre-ordered and pre-loaded before it was even released today. I was excited to finally revisit a game I once played on a friend's PS3 on my own PC after all these years. 

The problem? The porting job for this game is absolutely atrocious. However many minutes it says I have played this game, none of it was actual playtime. That was just while this game was loading shaders, and crashing every give or take five minutes. I'm on four crashes and just hit 10% shader loading. That is absolutely unacceptable for $60, much less the $70 I paid for the deluxe version. I hope this gets fixed swiftly, and that the publishers of the disaster of a port adequately compensate those who they took money from but delivered a shoddy product. The Last of Us is excellent and deserves every bit of hype and praise that can be showered upon it, but this game as it stands right now is trash and unplayable."

Game for me is running High/Ultra settings. Still the game more or less with capped fps of 90, still runs around 55-65. While areas with a lot of load, like the starting city part it can dip down to 45. With settings set to high, this makes it steady 55, usage of GPU load via settings information after testing/changing was around 75-88 in GPU load. GPU Temp settling around 65-73.

Overall the game is set to be playable at 970 (Of course this is not with max settings) But given the issues on loading, freezing, high GPU load even with lowered settings. This game is clearly not optimized, even with latest driver updates it still struggles. Seems a lot like the issues there were with Horizon Zero Dawn, where we are gonna have to wait for updates/fixes for the next 6 months to resolve.

I purchased this for 59.99€ as a pre-order on February 15th. I waited 1.5 months for this, until the end of March. 2 days ago, the Steam client allowed me to download the game files already. So I did. Yay!

Today, the day it was released, I logged on to Steam - and the game needed to decompress or something first, which took about 30 minutes or an hour or so of background work. Couldn't have done that 2 days ago and just let me play today. Nope. Had to be done the moment I wanted to play it.

So then after it's done expanding, I click the green PLAY button - and I get a warning dialog. My graphics driver is outdated. I need to have at least version 22.x installed. But I have graphics driver version 23.x installed. OK, so I click the warning away (every time I launch the game) and the game starts.

I configure a few things, end up in the main menu. Just about to start playing, when the game tells me it's better to wait until shader generation is done, otherwise the game will be slow. I notice a little message in the lower right corner of my screen, something like ""Generating Shaders: 2%"". 

I have an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X with 32 GB of RAM, all-out NVMe SSDs, and my Gigabyte AMD Radeon Vega64 Gaming OC Windforce 2X with 8G is no slouch either. If this graphics card can render Red Dead Redemption 2 in 4K at full details without any stuttering or frame rate issues on a slower CPU, then in this constellation there should be no problems rendering a game at 27"" native 2560x1440p.

Fun fact: it took my machine 30 minutes (!) to generate 20% of the shaders. And this is the case EVERY TIME I start the game. In other words: the game expects me to launch the game 2.5 hours before I actually want to start playing, just so it can generate its shaders. Nuh-uh, not happening.

To put this 2.5 hour value into relation: it would take the game longer to generate its shaders ONCE, i.e. for ONE session, than Steam allow as the maximum playing time inside which it's possible to return the game.

The Steam discussions about this problem mention that Naughty Dog released the game with a buggy or faulty version of the Oodle de-/compression tool. Some people say it's version 2.9.6 that has a memory leak or something, and replacing it with version 2.9.5 works just fine. Only problem: the Oodle library can not be freely downloaded for ""the likes of me"", it's only available to the developers. 

A few links surfaced in the Discussions area, all to either Russian websites or otherwise shady ""anyone can upload anything"" hosting pages, that allegedly provide the non-buggy version 2.9.5 of the Oodle library. Others suggested installing games that also use Oodle (like Warframe or FIFA 23) and copying the Oodle DLL file over from that. Just that Warframe is free but a 30+ GB download, and FIFA 23 isn't free, and I'm not going to spend anymore time or money on fixing something that should not have been distributed like this anyway.

I will check back tomorrow, and then maybe again next Monday. If these (non isolated, very widely present) problems aren't fixed until then, I will make use of my right to return this flaming heap of sh-t. 

What a f-cking money grab. Imagine a 10 year old game not being able to perform on modern hardware. And then actually asking money for it. The nerve of these pr-cks!"

Edit: It appears at least for me, that the primary issue is a bad compression library that was bundled in with the game. I suspect this has already been discovered by the team who did this work and is working on a fix. In the meantime, you are welcome to try the following link.

Steps to replace, are to simply retrieve the file linked below, extract it, and place the DLL into the game install directory. For most folks that will be C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Last of Us Part I

Original Review
Like many others, I do not recommend this game as is right now. Between the shaders being built for over a half hour for me (and I consider myself one of the lucky ones). Even trying to load the game after the shaders being built was done. It took MINUTES to even load the first level. I actually gave up and turned it off, and it didn't even hit 1/4 of the level loaded. This is abysmally poor optimization and Sony and Iron Galaxy should be ashamed. I am a software engineer myself, and I would have been fired if I released a product in such a poor state.

Do yourself a favor, and wait for them to optimize this the way they should have before they released this for money."

I'd rather spend my time doing something else than testing a partially completed product.

There is a reason why there were no review codes sent out. They knew that the game wasn't in good shape which is why they delayed it in February. They most likely rushed the release after the success of the HBO show.

Not only could I not, but I couldn't even maintain 60 FPS with 1080p, DLSS set to Performance, and all graphics settings as low as they could go. An absolute joke. Spending my first hour and a half waiting for shaders, and load times in excess of a minute are just insulting when given this level of performance.

Edit: Saw a couple reviews mention that the FPS gets better after the prologue. While true, the increase is only marginal and there's a terrible stutter that's impossible to ignore. It also doesn't excuse that I have yet to play more than 10 minutes in a row without a crash, and many crashes happen on launch or at the start of cutscenes.

The shader building on the main menu. Yes I know it's something they have to install and with patience it finally finishes. My issue with it, was it had to do it 3 times! I've sunk 5 hours into this game, all of it being waiting for the shaders to build. And each time it got to 100% and finished. A bug maybe? Or just the state that it's in kept requiring it to build?

I have a good set of headphones and I never NEVER have to turn my output to max in any game. This was the first.

It's a shame really since Sony/Naughty Dog decided to cooperate with Iron Galaxy rather than Nixxes to release TLOU Part I. I've been waiting for this game to release since i'm a huge fan of ND's storytelling and their characters, but all of the problems prevents me from enjoying the experience or even tried to feel the emotion the game tries to convey.

Rocking with i7-10700F, RTX 3060, and only 16GB of RAM, other games ran smoothly with this rig, especially the newest games like RE4, and MW2 with 90+ and 120+ fps respectively. For a game that is already 10 years old using the newest tech and graphical improvement, that is not an excuse for Iron Galaxy's laziness. 50-70 fps on High 1080p settings? I even had to use DLSS to improve the fps but its minimum to no avail. 

(It's a shame really, you really need an expensive rig to run TLOU Part I in this very state, it's not even a smooth experience even if you reached above 70+ fps since the mouse movement is so stiff.)

CPU usage is also terrible, I had to wait for almost 2 hours to finish preloading the shaders, because when I tried to play while the shaders still preloading, the perfomance were terrible and alot of hitching (same condition for HZD) but HZD were able to maintain good perfomance after shaders preload, though it's suffers from the same problems, that is the horrendous perfomance on launch day.

The game itself is a masterpiece on its own. With its story and their world building, My first 1 hour of playtime (considering the 2 hours of shaders preload, bs i know) is amazing, the characters are well voice/well-acted, the graphical technology, and the movement is as smooth as other ND's games. It is NOT RECOMMENDED to play this masterpiece since the bugs and the problems will ruin your time, they should be ashamed to ruin a first timer experience, like for those who hasn't played TLOU or watch the newest show on HBO at all.

Better to wait out until Iron Galaxy decided to patch all the problems. Shaders preload, terrible perfomance, popping textures, stuttering, and jittery mouse movements. I am really disappointed that Naughty Dog would let Iron Galaxy ruined their most beloved franchise.

Now when playing the game I was one of the few that didn't have the entire story spoiled. To simply put it, the game itself is phenomenal. This goes up along with Red Dead 2 as one of my favorite narrative game experiences ever. The chemistry the characters have and the movie-like nature of it all really does make it a unique experience.

As someone who hasn't played a Naughty Dog game before, I was a little concerned about their linearity. However I can 100% say that it was towards this games benefit. But I think this style of game isn't for me. Will I play this game again? Absolutely. If TLOU Part 2 comes to PC will I play that? Without a doubt. Will I buy another Naughty Dog game from a different series? Probably not. Unless there's another Naughty Dog game that comes close to this level of story telling, I think the main draw of TLOU and it's style of game is kind of gone.

I have almost no issues running the game on my PC.

GTX 1660 (*Changed to Radeon RX 6800 XT)
Ryzen 7 5800x
16GB DDR4 3200Mhz RAM (*Changed to 64GB DDR4 3200Mhz RAM)
800w PSU

The game automatically went for low settings and mostly runs at 60FPS for me. I don't mind switching to 30FPS with mostly high to ultra settings for now as I played this on the TV so far and with a controller. Although, I do end up having lower than 30FPS in some cases, but I can't exactly expect any magic from my 1660. 

It's playable enough for me, at least once I remove real-time reflections, but any performance improvements from the devs are always welcome. 

The game itself doesn't deserve the bad reviews, but I fully understand that some people will complain about the drivers, so I'm wondering though, if they tried:

Allowing the shaders to fully compile in the main menu.
Upgraded their graphics drivers to the latest version.
Simply played around with the graphics settings to see which is the most intensive and reducing it. 

Any review under 0.2 hours automatically means they didn't apply the above.

Either way, I personally recommend it, but do wait for fixes if you can't run the game."

Unfortunately, I don't know what Naughty Dog did with the extra time, but they sure didn't optimize the game. 

Not only do you have to wait for an hour for the shaders to compile at the beginning, and it takes up an additional 30GB of disk space, but when you start the game, you realize there are FPS drops all over the place, and the game slows down even though it claims to run at 60 FPS.

I never played the remaster, I come from the PS3 era, and I honestly wasn't impressed by the new graphics, let alone think they're worth $60, so I found the purchase absurd. I'd rather buy Resident Evil 4, which did receive a thorough facelift and modernization, and get this game when it's 80% off.

105 Min of Shader Instalation, the game runs around 90 to 100 FPS Max Specs 1440p, Tried the left behind DLC to test the game as i wanted to do it before the 2 Hours cap (i got the cap anyway), it looks worst than RE4 Remake and Run worst, i have an Expensive Card, may not be a 4090 but still expensive enough to expect better performance, i cant imagine people playing in the average PC, Average PC (still around 1k dollar) which is expensive anyway, to summarize, it is a bad port, if you are unlucky and waste your 2 hours to refund while waiting for shader installation to see the game is unplayable in your system then you will have issues to get a quick refund sadly, i love the game, did buy the original ps3 version in 2013, the remaster 2014 and the remake in 2022, got this free because of my GPU but still a game i dont recommend till they do fixes, there is a toxic behaviour of having to wait months or years for a game to be fixed and a lot of people defending that kind of situations since day 1, worst part is that the people who will enjoy the game with all the fixes in a couple of months will get it way cheaper than the people who paid full price day 1 full of bugs

Disclaimer
- Was cooking with my wife so i left the game do its job, finish that around min 100 so i kinda sit down 5 min looking at the screen while it finish the installation
- Didnt restart game to test if it goes faster to be honest as i didnt want to risk wasting the time and well, i was going to do other stuff anyway
- All my hardware is working correctly without issues (no vapor chambing errors etc etc)"

I literally never leave reviews, I’ve been a PC gamer for nearly 20 years, and I am also a massive fan of the last of us. I bought a PS3 to specifically play the original and then bought a PS4 just to play part 2. This remake is absolutely trash. I spent nearly 40 minutes waiting for the shaders to load and then almost 50 minutes watch the loading icon inch slower to full only to have the game crash to desktop in the first 5 minutes. This is on a rig with a 7950x and 7900xtx running off a crucial p5 plus m.2. I have literally never refunded a game in the history of my steam account, but having nearly my entire 2 hour refund window eaten up and only being in game for roughly 5 minutes makes this a first.

Update: Completely playable and I sit at around 100 fps on high settings on AMD's ASR or whatever, on 527.56 Nvidia drivers. But I'm still not going to recommend it yet because there are people who still can't play.

Update after finishing the game: This game is in the top 3 of best games I've ever played, what a beautiful and extremely engaging and fun game.

I'm going to just list and throw things at you instead of trying to put it together in a concise manner since I just finished the game and it's all fresh.

I vaguely knew the end of the game going into it (I did wait 10 years or so to play it after all), but the story is absolutely wonderful, it's enthralling and never once did I feel bored or like ""Ugh I just wanna get this game over with."". Every time I felt like ""Oh, the end of the game is coming up... darn..."" the game ends up giving you another 2-3 hours, and that happens about 4 times (Ish, I don't remember exactly.) and it's absolutely awesome.

One of the only games to do stealth right and make it extremely immersive and fun. Going to replay on the hardest difficulty most likely so I can experience the stealth in an even harder way. (Dishonored 1 and Splinter Cell are the only others I can think of right now that do it well.)

Best visuals of any game I've ever played, it's amazing how much configuration there is in the graphics settings, and also the way they showcase each and every graphics setting is extremely different and vastly useful. It's something you would think would be commonplace in the gaming industry but absolutely isn't, I don't think I've ever played a game that was as indepth for graphics settings as The Last of Us is.

If you had to show a videogame to an alien civilization this would be one of the ones you chose, if not the first one you picked.

The combat is SO visceral, I wasn't super into using the melee weapons you find around, but the gunplay and the shiv combat is absolutely breathtaking and beautifully animated. It's extremely grotesque too but in a good way, the realism is amazing, I have heard rumors that Naughty Dog suggested and or encouraged their developers to look at real life gore to help with their work. Now I don't know if it's true but it's absolutely 100% easy to believe given how gore looks in the game. I normally am squeamish and tend to hate excessive gore in videogames but it's genuinely likeable and feels extremely on par.

There is so much polish in places where you wouldn't expect it, even just for a few seconds of gameplay, like Joel riding the horse and ducking his head, etc.

The dialogue system is really nice and refreshing.

Still feeling bad about Sarah during the credits, I don't think I have ever been so emotionally attached to a character that had so little time in the actual story. Her part of the game and story is so tragic and I feel so much empathy for it, it hurts a little now even writing this.

I absolutely love it and give it a 10/10, I would be recommending yes in a normal situation but given how bad the release was (I didn't get to play more than a few hours until a week or so after buying it, I tolerated about 70 freezes and maybe 5 ish crashes but then it became unplayable and it would freeze or crash faster than I could progress lol, or it just wouldn't boot to the main menu and would lock up at launch), but I want to stand in solidarity with other people that can't get it to run and help be a part of getting it fixed, even if it's a small contribution.

Even during the credits I was already wanting to play it again, I don't think I've ever felt that way about any other game I've ever played."

The Last (turd of a port they gave) Us

Good think I bought a cheap key from a grey market site, I hope it was shady enough so developers dont get a cent from it.

Devs release an unoptimized game (it even shipped with an old decomoression library) then leave the fixing to users.

Im taking screenshots of user made fixes and workaround, so far theres a dozen. Hmmm, play now and spend hours troubleshooting, or play another game?

Answer> shouldnt have bought this on release just to wait days or weeks for patches.

I just wrote mah feelings about this, a day after release in a thread. I thought since it was very honest write up, could paste it and better help understand my review. Here it goes in case anybody cares:

""I managed to get it to run decently to good yesterday. 3.6h played, but it only felt like I played a videogame for 20 mins.

So burned out with troubleshooting, so many reports of issues....im not even gonna run it. Im gonna play an old game thats guaranteed to make me have some fun.

I dont buy games yesterday to be played tomorrow, thats for sure. But letting the game ruin my mood again? Or playing it while not fully enjoying it due to x or y issue? also dont sound appealing.

so both options are kinda bad. I liked for example Atomic Heart, I enjoyed it from day 1. Even sons of the forest, kinda unoptimized, made me play 65h without almost noticing. Here? unhyped as fku.

I still expect the game to get better through patches, but my hype, my child like engagement to enjoy a new toy, is gone. im back to the adult mood of yeah, everything suks, even a simple videogame to make me evade from other things that suk.

so? permanent negative review is the minimum. Even if the game gets fixed and I enjoy it as much as the biggest fanboy says it can be enjoyed.

And ofc, new rule: always buy cheap keys from grey market, shady places. Full price is a scam with this kind of releases. The key somewhat compensates it."""

The game is however great and looks stunning.
Naughty Dog also updated some features from Unchartered; e.g. more features in Photo Mode, which is a nice addition.

After that, I was able to play the game somewhat decently and the game crashed once when I opened a door during my first 30 or so minutes (currently 3 hours of real gameplay).

I'm trying not to check too frequently the RAM, CPU, GPU and VRAM usage but the performance tanks a lot during the rainy scenes. From 70~80fps to 45ish.

Definitely wait for an update to buy or play because the performance is all over the place and waiting for almost 2 hours to finish loading the shaders with crashes every 10 or so minutes to even begin playing is unbelievably bad.

[*]Loading times. Loads like molasses.
[*]No Multiplayer. Contentious point since PS5 version doesn't have multiplayer either, but the multiplayer was fantastic and part of the reason the game maintained popularity. Its just a disappointment that content has been stripped away and they're still expecting full price.

Looks amazing, has a super flexible options menu for PC and it's one of the best games of all time.  Though how on earth the Devs thought it was a good idea to release it in this state, I'll never know!?!  They must know there are issues... they can't not!

Personally, I don't mind the one off shader compilation time... but then, it was only about 25 mins for me on my rig (yes, I consider myself one of the lucky few).  I'd much rather have upfront compilation than a stuttering mess of a game. (even if this title does seem a bit extreme with regards to time to complete!).

Or at least, that's what I thought, but unfortunately, I still get a stuttering mess of game because it's just so badly CPU optimised.  One minute I'm all Ultra 4K, maxed at 120fps, my eyes bleeding from how good the upgrade is, loving revisiting this classic title.... next minute my CPU utilisation is up at 80-90% leaving my poor 4090 kicking it's heels at around 60% utilisation and my FPS plumet to around 54fps.  If I'm rocking a 5900x and seeing this kind of CPU behaviour, then I hate to think what's happening to others with lower spec'd rigs.  And yes, shader compilation had 100% completed....

Even running 1080p Low settings to brute force a fix, I still see's that the title is completely CPU choked at times... it's embarrassing.  How very very disappointing for the Devs, let alone us fans / gamers!  :(

I'd sit tight if you have yet to purchase... hopefully they'l be able to patch this mess and do justice to the players.  The potential is there for sure!"

The game regularly interrupts gameplay with abrupt loading screens saying ""Please Wait"" despite being installed on an SSD on a Higher Spec Rig.

The Last Of Us has always been one of my fav games, I've played it through five times on ps and also for two of my friends. I really love the game and I remember the whole storyline like where to go, what comes next etc. 

But then, Naughty Dog was just being too naughty when I waited ages just for a golf club. I loved Joel so much, he was my fav character. And I enjoyed every moment of seeing Joel and Ellie together, I loved their bond, their friendship and I even wished for them to come together as a couple (っ˘̩╭╮˘̩)っ

But it all ended with my tears shed for half an hour. For totally half an hour I just stared at my TV screen and couldn’t stop crying. It was the cruelest moment for me and also for many other players. I dun get why it has to end like this (・_・ヾ.

TLOU Part I is one of the best games ever, I can really recommend it to everyone. But I’m not gonna vote it with a thumbs up(•ิ_•ิ). And if u get emotional about game stories like I do, make sure u dun play TLOU Part II, coz then this game will no longer remain TLOU, it’d become The Golf Club: Prequel. And I've heard there’ll be a The Golf Club: Afterstory too. Let’s do some sports then again.

This game is absolutely incredible, but the PC port is so bad it just is even more miserable to play than it normally is. I wouldn't recommend this right now, but once it gets fixed, I'll update this review.

In 2 hours of gameplay (88 minutes of playtime was spent just building the shader cache alone), I've experienced 1 crash, a LOT of drops below 60FPS often hovering around 40FPS on a mix of medium-high settings at the recommended specs and I'm also playing with DLSS on so I don't dare imagine what it runs like without that crutch. 

The patch that came out today as of 29th of March has improved things a bit, and I'm glad they're updating this quickly because I can't be bothered waiting so long for the actual version to come out.

The opportunity to play it at 1440p uncapped with better fidelity and then later planning to try it out on my LG CX at true 4K was a lure too irresistible to ignore. Unfortunately, the game itself ran pretty bad. When it was running lag/stutter free it ran like a dream on Ultra around 140-160 on native 1440p. The main problems were the frame rate drops in 60-70 range the the lack of fluidity when playing (even on controller I noticed this after switching from MKB).

Mouse stutter has been fixed and performance, textures, and shader compilation are somewhat improved. General performance still needs a lot of work, but things are slowly improving.

---

The game looks great and I'm glad it's finally on PC after all these years, but the port has some issues. Shader compilation sucks and takes quite a while, but it is a one-time thing and is important for performance. That said, performance is a bit on the low end. With my 3080ti and 5950x I can get 90 fps [i]most[/i] of the time at 3440x1440 on medium with DLSS on performance. I'm not going to complain too much since I'm not running a typical resolution, but you're going to need DLSS for pretty much any lower tier hardware or if aiming for higher than 60fps.

There is one major issue that guarantees a negative review from any PC player - major mouse stutter. It's crazy that this made it past even the earliest stages of QA, and is an issue that apparently [i]also[/i] plagues the uncharted 4 port. The only way to [i]potentially[/i] fix this is to change a bunch of mouse, monitor, and GPU settings to specifically work around this bug. And by doing so, you mess up the settings for everything else on your PC... which makes it a pretty poor solution. As you might expect, controllers don't experience this issue, so I'll be using a Dualsense until they release a patch.

Fortunately, the good news is [i]very[/i] good news. There are a TON of graphical options and settings to tweak the game to your liking. Native Utrawide support is very appreciated and the realtime cutscenes don't force black bars (unless you want them to!). I haven't experienced any crashes or microstutters on my desktop as of yet (though I do have a pretty beef PC). No Denuvo is good to see, and Steam Deck is supported at launch. Accessibility options are extensive and are always welcome for those who need them. 

Never thought I'd see the day PC gamers get to experience this game. We're just a few patches away from being able to recommend one of the best Playstation exclusives ever made."

My 5800H and RTX 3060 6GB laptop can actually run it at 1440p@60fps with Medium graphics settings and DLSS on (although there are annoying dips to 55-ish which in other games don't feel as ""stuttery"" as with this one so I locked it at 50 and called it a day).

- Shaders that take up to 2 hours to compile (Took me almost 30 mins on a high end PC)

Overall, if you played the original and want to experience the Last of Us on PC then I do recommend buying the port.

EDIT: I stand corrected, hard. I wrote this review WHILE playing the game, and no joke 10 minutes after this review I crashed. Keep in mind I had played for 2 hours at this point, and this was my first crash. I was hoping it was a one-time thing, and unfortunately I have continued to crash at random points in the game. I am really hoping that for the sake of this franchise they don't ruin their reputation, with this frankly, terrible excuse for a game. After the crashes I started getting increasingly bad performance issues, I'm going to wait it out since I am past the return period, and just pray they do a Cyberpunk and fix most of the issues.

I enjoyed every second of this game. It's still one of the greatest single player games I've ever played; even their multiplayer was the most fun I had since MW2 S&D.
As much as I loved it, I surely was not about to purchase this game again, especially not for $70 . . . but here I am.
I'd say it was to support Naughty Dog, but truthfully, I just wanted to relive a little bit of the nostalgia, since most every highly anticipated game in the last 10 years hasn't always lived up to their hypes. 
I knew this one would be good.

Just to emphasize: this review is NOT based off the game. It's strictly based off the fact that it is absolutely unplayable. At least for right now.
I know it's a huge issue, so I hope by the time some of you read this, it'll have been fixed so PC players can enjoy the beauty of this game, apart from the TV show.

Review:
I've updated my graphics card, validated the files, completed all the advised steps to ensure the game would run successfully, however nothing has worked. The only thing I think may fix the issue is waiting for my shaders to completely install, which is why I'm 10 minutes into the game with 93 minutes played, haha. 

Update, shaders didn't work; I ran the game outside of safe mode and it worked a bit longer.
Update 2: turned off vsync, lowered all my graphic settings to bare minimum, set to performance, enabled a few performance monitors like GPU usage and VRAM, so far so good!

So to sum it up: great game, terrible bug.


Side note: I hope they release a co-op DLC version of this, along with their original multiplayer as well.
Because I swear on my life, if they release a 3rd game . . .
And it's the re-remastering of the same ****ing game with just multiplayer/co-op added . . .
I will not be playing this story TWENTY-ONE more times. I don't care how good it is.

For me the game crashes in the menu of the game whilst downloading the shaders. I have seen alot of people experiensing the same thing so I hope that this is something that can be fixed with a patch.
I do not know if tyhe crashing stops after the shaders are done compiling, but I do not want to test it ither becouse of the fact that it will take over 2 h to do, and the I will not be able to refund the game. 

So if anyone is having the same problem as me and have fixed it somehow, or have waited for the shader compiling and seen it fix itself, Please let me know. 

I do not know if I am nyive in thinking this, but I only have 8gb ram, but I have not had anny ploblems playing games that require 12 or even 16 gigs in the past, so I asumed that it would not be a problem now either. Am I wrong about that? Becouse otherwise I will just wait to play the game when I either buy a new pc in the future or if I buy a Ps5.

I absolutely love the game!, (I played it back when it came out on ps3) but the Pc port just does not work for me so I will probably not be able to play it :("

This port on Day 1 (It should be fixed with patches tbh) is just not playable.  So far i have sat waiting for 40 mins while i installed shaders.  Then at a certain point in the story before the time jump (trying to avoid spoilers) it was like a disco, so many neon lights in a night time scene it was horrible and distracting.  Then i keep getting a circle with ""Please Wait"" coming up frequent enough that i have put the game down until it is patched!

I find this to be highly disappointing coming from a huge corporate company who has already has two successful titles to this big triple AAA game. The fact we wait so long just for you all to release a finished that doesn't run like a dog that has shit stuck on his ass. This is bogus, when we expect a finished game you all have a pre-order, pre-load knowing it runs like shit, when you can CLEARLY test the game yourselves. It's a poor excuse of god damn laziness and selling a title for money cause you know people are going to buy. 

Gamers are tired of this bullshit, we aren't here for this sub par half ass releases. We just ask we get what we pay for. Hi-Fi Rush is a perfect example of a finished game, and by far ten times more effort than this ever received. A finished game with a $30 price tag not even $60 and it came out finished and blowing everyones expectations out of the water. NO ADVERTISEMENT, NO BULLSHIT, a finished game. 

It's about time it was said, I probably won't give a good review even when it is fixed, cause their is no excuse for a release like this in general. There wouldn't be a excuse in 2002 so why now. Just so you can ""update"" and fix it over time. This is a poor excuse. Don't even make it if you can't.

So getting this game on PC was like a dream, and now I have it....

... that's where the dissapointment comes in. If you want to buy this, after release, be sure to check your hardware!

Make sure you're not even close to the min specs and make sure you don't have any bottleneck configs in your systems.
Also be REALLY sure you want to keep this game! Why?

If you are like me, in between the min and rec specs of the game, you will get lagging, crashing, slow gameplay. 
Shaders need to be compiled which takes up between 30 to 2+ hours of time. Look at the discussion boards for this game.
According to steam I have been playing this game, ""playing"" = running, for 1,1 hours. Shaders have been compiled for 26%. 
During that compiling the game will get lags and give you messages like ""Please wait..."". 

I admit to have an older system, which still should work good enough according to the specs. But I noticed I have a bottleneck, which is my CPU. My GPU is hardly used while I am in a menu or waiting to be able to play for 5 minutes before I get the next ""please wait"" message.

So compiling the shaders will take up time that exceeds the refund period. If you're like me and want to keep the game anyway, you can go ahead. Otherwise I would advise not to buy or get a better system first. 
I play now on the lowest settings and this does nothing for the shaders, that is all CPU. 

I can not recommend this game based on the fact it is slow and needs a lot of time to do background tasks which make refund impossible if the game is not to your liking. 

Edit: 2,5 hour of gameplay, 37% shaders compiled."

I initially wrote in anger this was the worst PC port I've ever seen. This is not really the case, but that does not mean the port is a good one either. 

I waited for almost 2.5 hours for the game to build shaders while crashing in the main menu every 5 or so mintutes - one of the most frustrating experiences I've had with a game. To clarify, if the game didn't crash every 5 mins while in the main menu, it would've taken half the time to build the shaders and actually start playing.

In general, my PC (even though fairly bad) is covering the minimum requirements and doesn't really have a lot of issues whatsoever running the game on mid to low settings. I never expected to play it on anything higher than that. 

The game actually runs decently. I expected a lot worse with my specs but mid preset + AMD FSR2 set on Quality is the most you can squeeze out of the game with this/similar hardware with it being playable and enjoyable. The only problems are the crashes on loading screens and the weird mouse movement (stutter-ish). Still, crashes at random times and at loading screens are pretty frustrating and for people with a lot higher specs than mine to be experiencing FPS drops and crashes is unacceptable. There is also a very annoying issue with audio crackling. Still would not recomment buying until it has been patched.

I am covering the minimum requirements but I am running a below average (for current gaming standarts) system:

EDIT: Just finished, and even this far after release i dont recommend it. the game constantly asks for shaders to build, meaning you cant even play for extended periods of time, but you have to keep the game open for them to build.

Perfectly tolerable. No more crashes. You can play it and it's an amazing, well crafted experience. Stellar game. Too many pallet and dumpster sections but whatever. It's no longer ""broken"" - though I did have to restart a couple checkpoints after putting down the necessary item and not being able to interact with it again

Huge improvement from launch day, which isn't much of a compliment. Now in a playable state for me where it looks and runs roughly as I would expect on recommended settings, and doesn't detract from the experience most of the time. Stop to focus on any details though and it still looks subpar

Pros:
- Beautiful game. Arguably one of the best looking games ATM. The original may be from 2013, but this remaster has pretty much redone the visuals from the ground up. Naughy Dog does lighting better than anyone else.
- Amazingly detailed graphics options menu, good job on that.
- Shader precompilation (it takes ages to complete, but it's good that they included it)
- Dual sense controller support (would be weird if it didn't have it, but still)

Cons:
- A lot of stutters. This is the big issue really. Standing in the same spot, in a small room, just rotating the camera will produce severe stutter, making the camera movement very unpleasant. It's not always a problem, but a lot of the time it's there, and really takes you out of the experience. I tried tweaking all of the settings, but it doesn't seem to make much difference.
- Very long load times. Haven't seen load times this bad for many years. Ever since SSDs became the norm, load times have pretty much become a non-issue. Not quite so here.
- Quite high CPU usage in many areas. May be related to the stutters.

If they can fix the stuttering, my review will immediately be changed to a Positive one.

Ok, i completed the game, and i've gone through the various hotfixes and the first 2 main patches (1.0,2.0 and the most recent 1.0.3.0). What can i say... did it get better? Yes and no. Again, i wish steam offered the chance to give it a mixed review rather than a straight negative or positive.

The main issues i discussed in my original review on launch date was insane cpu utlization, insane shader compilation waiting and camera movement jitteriness/microstutters. I would say that sadly, only 1/3 of these issues i've had has been fixed, and not even that well, if i have to be honest.
The cpu utilization slightly went down to around 62/65% compared to the 70/75% on launch, which is still pretty much insane and there's absolutely no reason to it. The shader compilation times are pretty much still the same, maybe 5 minutes faster? On launch it took me something like 55 minutes, on patch 1.0.2.0 it took me around 50, so yeah.
Mouse camera movement jitters have been specifically adressed in a recent hotfix. Did they fix it completely? Yes and no. I noticed that it can still happen on high foliage section and no matter if i use a controller or not (it used to be a mouse only thing) the last chapter, the open area of it, it does it both on mouse and on controller, which clearly shows this game was rushed out the door. Basically, if you want to see how the game was on launch, reach the last chapter (spring) open area. That's how the game played then (if you were able to play it that is). So pretty much i'd say it got fixed 80% of the times (at least it doesnt happen in city and buildings environment. So there's that.

Will i change my vote to a positive? After what you (hopefully) read through, would you? I won't. The game is still feels early access-y to me. No where near being one of the best game of the past few years, from a triple A developing company and from a publisher like Sony. They truly pulled a quick cash grab job with us PC players using their golden goose as bait. The last bit of juice to squeeze for the franchise. It's a shame.

Will i ever come back to update my review once again? Maybe. If i ever re play this game in a year or two just to see if they actually improved their game and not simply put tiny weenie band aid on a wound that goes from the neck down to the belly button. We'll see.


[h1] ORIGINAL REVIEW ON LAUNCH DATE [/h1]

Oh boy... this is rough to say the least.

I'll start to say i have a fairly hi end pc (r7 5800x cooled by a fucking 420 aio from arctic, 32 gb of ddr4 3800mhz cl14, a 6800xt gpu and im running this on my sabrent rocket pci 3.0). All my drivers and bios are up to date. I keep my pc clean and all that good shiz. This game is tough tho, in every sense of the word
.
Im using ultra settings at 1440p and the game runs fine, but there's a one huge problem: it's EXTREMELY cpu bound, to the point that it uses 90% of my cpu (while compiling shaders) and while in game anywhere between 70/75%.
Also the loading times are INSANE. First time i launched the game i had to wait almost 60 minutes to load the shaders. Then when you launch a saved game you have to wait another solid 2/3 minutes for it to load. Friendly reminder i have this installed on an nvme ssd, not a sata ssd. That thing can read at 3.2gb/s and write at 2.9gb/s, so yeah... it is INSANE.

Fair do, im just after the intro of the game, so i still have to load an ""open world"" save. I'm afraid lol. But yeah, launch isn't looking good. Hopefully they fix it with a patch or two, especially the insanity with the cpu running at 75% for most of the game (aside cutscenes) giving micro stutter as a consequence and high temps ( i have never seen a game making my aio cooled 5800x run at nearly 70 degrees, that usually only happens when i stress test my cpu with something like cinebench multicore).

The real issue here is the mouse camera movement jitters. It's insane and it's very distracting (it feels like your whole screen is tearing, if you don't know what tearing is, look it up on youtube). On controller there's no such issue, and the camera rotations are buttery smooth.

Again, since i loved this game so much when i played years back on ps3 borrowed by a friend, i decided to give it a go considering the other ps port i've played recently (god of war) was fantastic in terms of optimization. I guess this wasn't the case sadly. I should've waited reviews. Finger crossed for as i said, a patch or two to fix the poor cpu performances (im not expecting miracle gpu wise, the game looks amazing so it's fairly normal having the need of a beefy pc to run it the way i do). Also i've seen other people talking about crashes. So far i had none (again, keep in mind i played something like 30 minutes so that might change for me later).

IF YOU HAVE A LOWER END PC (i'd say look at the 1080p recommended from the naughty dog chart) JUST WAIT. Watch benchmarks online of your config (make sure they're using the same cpu too, since as i said right now it is EXTREMELY cpu bound and unoptimized). Don't just look for your gpu. Make sure the benchmark you're looking at uses the same cpu too.

Finished the game, kind of fixed performance issues but had FPS drops everytime AI spawned in.
Its just a pretty average game, the final two chapters are the best and Ellie is a decent character.
I never played the original in hopes of it coming to PC so I could experience it with amazing graphics and performance but that wasnt the case.

Honestly, if you never played the original and want it on PC, give it a while to be patched and optimised and grab it on a sale, you arent missing out if you never play it imo. Personally think its overrated not sure how it got so many awards."

This game is obv a classic, so my opinion probably means nothing; nonetheless I still believe that the main story is very short. Yes, the story is compelling and engaging, but the game leaves some big questions unanswered and just skips key elements of the story...

Yeah... 
About that...

barely 60-80fps @ 1440p. 
Stuttering, input lag in some areas, black screen flickers at some points.

Sure its a 1st world problem. Good PC and complains about FPS that some PCs can only dream of.

Lets put it into perspective.
PS5 Runs TLoU at 60fps in 1080p, 1440p and 4k.
According to my short google search, in some ""performance mode"".

Hardware wise:
- AMD Ryzen Zen 8 -> 16 thread @ 3.5GHz
- AMD Radeon GPU with 16GB GDDR6 @ 10 TFLOPS

I'm simplifying this as PS5 hardware works different to PC and is much more embedded.

So you're telling me I can barely push 60fps on 1440p with my CPU and GPU cooking at 95% utilisation, with a spec much better than a PS5, but my experience is worse than a PS5?

My PC specs are:

[list]
[*]GeForce RTX 3060 12GB
[*]AMD Ryzen 5 5600X
[*]32GB RAM
[*]The game is installed on an SSHD (a hybrid drive that's better than an HDD, but not as good as an SSD)
[/list]

Apart from all the other problems such as crashes and stuttering, the game doesn't run that well. I get an average of 60fps on 1080p with DLSS quality and any graphical settings. I didn't have any stats on the screen, so I couldn't see if the problem was with my CPU, but my CPU shouldn't have trouble running this game.

I had some texture problems. Even with high settings, some textures looked blurry. If I tried to change graphical settings mid-game, the game would start glitching, and the illumination and textures would get messed up for some time.

I decided that the game wasn't worth my money after the second combat encounter, where it shows you the stealth mechanics. Some of the problems I encountered (SPOILERS for the early game) before that were:

[list]
[*]Almost an hour spent building shadders (not that bad if only done once, but I saw some people saying they had to do it all over again after closing the game)
[*]A lot of stuttering
[*]Audio desync before the car crash, which made the crash really goofy with Sarah screaming a whole 2 seconds before the crash
[*]Really poor performance before and after the Fireflies' attack
[*]After picking up Joel's backpack, the game instructed me to reload my gun by pressing the left mouse button, and to melee with F. I know you reload with R2/R1 in the original game, but that's because they were working with a controller layout, and it's not the same thing with M&K. Fortunately, you can rebind it, but it gave me the impression that the people who ported the game didn't bother to adapt the controls to the PC.
[*]One of the worst things I've seen so far, which I know won't be fixed since it's intentional. When the guy crushed by the locker asked me to mercy kill him, I tried to quickly aim and shoot him but missed his head. For some godforsaken reason, there is a vertical offset to the reticle in this game. Just why? The original game didn't have this issue. Why would I want to aim lower when trying to shoot straight? At this point, I quickly looked at the configs because I knew my 2 hours were almost up, but I couldn't find any option to fix this.
[*]Tess casually killed my FPS when she turned on her flashlight before knocking on the door where the kid opens for her.
[*]At that same scene, I tried to change my settings because the performance was atrocious. After leaving the menu, the game started glitching out, and everything started bugging graphically.
[*]I had to kill the first human enemies by hand because I wasted all my bullets testing the aim offset, but when it came time to finish the last guy, he fell to his knee after a punch, and the game refused to let me punch or grab him for a full 3 to 4 seconds. I could only do something when he started getting up.
[*]At that moment, I was already done with the game. So when I walked behind the guy where you need to stealth him, to my surprise, they changed the stealth mechanics so you are not silent if you're not crouched. That was on me, but I was already fed up, and that was the last straw.
[/list]

I would advise you to save your money and buy the Resident Evil 4 remake instead. The game is really something else. I would even say that it is one of the best games that I've ever played. The last time I was this invested playing a game was with The Last of Us Remastered for the PS4. I wish someday we could get that game for PC.

And if you still want to play this game, these problems are not due to Denuvo since the game doesn't have it. I'll leave it up to you to decide what to do with that information. ;)

Here's my old review, just for a laugh:

As of April 8th, the game has had several hotfixes and a 14 gb patch to boot. The game is still unplayable. It stutters every few seconds and pretty much destroys the rest of your pc. The framerate is more stable now, but that was never the problem to begin with. Its so unstable and bugged, that even on the lowest settings and after the unreasonably long wait for the games shaders to build, I still stutter almost every 6 seconds and watch several shaders stream in and build before my eyes.

I was at 100% CPU usage (3700x) IN THE MAIN MENUS the entire time. Afterburner says my CPU hit a 107 degree temperature and my 2070 Super was in the high 80s (never seen either of these go above 80-81C before) 
It crashed when I tried skipping the first cutscene (seen it dozen times.) The game is VERY heavy on VRAM. 8 GB cards can use High Texture settings at 1080p with DLSS on quality. Otherwise you're using medium texture settings. It has an accurate VRAM counter, from what I've discovered, unlike Resident Evil 2's. 

Now that I've gotten into playing it, it runs pretty good. I'm at a mixture of high and ultra settings at 60 fps, 1080p with DLSS Quality. Though, it feels like it should run way faster. Heavily relying on FSR and DLSS to push it over the mark. I feel it needs more optimization, for sure. It stutters ocassionally and does have some random spots that shoot up GPU and CPU usage. And I'll tell you right now, this game is HEAVY on the CPU. I'm constantly in the 80% usage (when I've never seen a game use more than 50%) of my Ryzen 3700x. It's an old chip, but still. Maybe that speaks to this game's usage of multi threading. Or it's un-optimization in translation from Playstation to PC? I don't know. But it's going to pound your CPU. 

It's an absolutely INCREDIBLE game, story and even the gameplay is pretty good. Though it is it's weakest part. The graphics options are absolutely top notch. TONS of options to play with and advanced features. In fact, the entire option system is even better than what's found on Playstation. Which was already some of the best in the business when it comes to accessibility options and quality of life tweaks. There is even an FOV slider and persistent center dot option.

Also, v-sync doesn't work at first. You have to go into options after launching game, un-check it and recheck the option on, then apply. I know everyone is freaking out about the port, and I initially was too. But I think a lot of these reviews were left by people trying to play before shader compilation. Which to be fair, is insane. I've never had a game take that long. It should be part of the installation process, ""hidden"" and mandatory. But still, since there's no MEH option on Steam, I have to give this a thumbs down for now. Simply for the issues with the shader compilation, crashing (I've had 6-8 times in 2 hours) and general unoptimization. I have a feeling that even though my PC is almost 5 years old now, Ryzen 3700x and 2070 Super with NVME drives, I imagine folks with even lesser PC's will struggle to run this at acceptable graphic options. You're going to be playing on low and medium, for a Remastered 2013 game if you have like... a 1080 or whatever the equivalent AMD card is."

- Hey, port is pretty messy, we aren't able to fix it in time, people are already getting suspicious by our sys requirements, what should we do for them not to refund it straight after launch? 
- Have you heard about shaders built process, kid?"
6696,3,0.3011,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","I've gotta say I'm pretty disheartened and disappointed with the way this port turned out. The original game was amazing and I think we all know that by now, so I was really looking forward to the PC release where I could play this game in all its glory. For context, I have a 3060 ti, which is a relatively decent graphics card - I'm usually able to play most games at 1440p and 60 frames with no issues, usually better. I understand that this game is a remake which means new graphics and improvements, but this game isn't necessarily pushing any huge graphical boundaries. While the PS5 version looks beautiful, it still isn't competing with games like Red Dead Redemption 2 or even The Last of Us Part 2. Realistically, this game should be running pretty smooth with no problem at all, especially with a PC graphics card.

When I booted up the game, my frame counter showed 15-30 frames on the menus! I wasn't super worried at first since sometimes there is a short adjustment and buffering when you first boot up a game, but the issue persisted. By default, my PC had the settings on high and medium, so I changed some things to lower settings to see what kind of frame increase I could get. Still, in the menus, I am getting less than 30 frames. It's a damn window with some flowing blinds....really? Okay, so before I start, I'm also looking at about 5% of my shaders being complete, and I've already spent 5-10 mins working on the graphics settings. How long is this going to take to load in? I already waited for a second install after the game unlocked, and I still haven't even broken through the menu. Screw it, I'm playing the game, the shaders can wait. Well, the intro cut scene is getting about 45-55 frames. Not ideal, but doable I suppose. Was definitely hoping for a little more. Once I'm actually playing as Sarah and walking around the house, I am lucky to get 45 frames, but I'm hovering closer to 35. Pretty disappointing, especially after already lowering some settings. Okay, I'm a little frustrated at this point with the performance, but let's lower the settings more and see what I'm getting. At the lowest settings I'm bouncing around 45-55 frames, but it's jumpy. As we are going through the truck sequence and driving through the city, I get hit with ""please wait"". I'm assuming that's because the shaders aren't loaded in completely, so maybe my fault, but really, I feel like that's a little bizarre to have in a game that is supposed to be well optimized. Anyway, as I play through the remainder of the intro, I am experiencing some significant frame drops, which were already low to begin with. The textures absolutely suck too because I'm playing on the lowest setting. 

Okay... time for a break, I'm just gonna wait for the shaders to load in and try again. I leave my PC for about 30 mins and come back. I'm at 37%... Dear lord this game is going to be the end of my sanity. So I hit up my friend with a brand new 4080 build, which should probably run this game with no issues...right? Well, sounds like it's not quite as bad as my situation, but on high settings, he still gets 60 or less frames.... with probably one of the best graphics cards available right now. Sounds like the optimization is poor all around. So at this point, I'm less than 50% loaded in with the shaders and I have close to an hour of running the game, do I still wait and try to run with the shaders? Or do I refund this thing and save my money? That's about where I am right now.

Okay, so final thoughts. In all honesty, never waited for the shaders to finish loading in. I get that, but based on what everyone else is saying and some other performance metrics from a better build, it's not really looking that great. Maybe there will be a patch coming soon to boost performance, who knows? I find it really interesting that there was not a single review of the PC version of this game up before release. As of right now, I still can't find one. I'm not trying to hop on the bandwagon and hate this game, but realistically it does seem really poorly optimized. I took work off for this and I'm pretty upset with the result that this port turned out to be. I am a fan of The Last of Us, and I was really looking forward to this release. Hopefully they get it fixed. I guess I will hold onto it for a few days and see if anything changes, but right now I am definitely leaning toward the refund."

Also CPU usage is insanely high with options on High. Hovers around 80-85%. RAM usage is also quite high for 1080p. Around 15gb.... I don't know if it's an optimization issue or if the game is just way too heavy but considering the system requirements...It should run better. I've noticed some micro stuttering as well when turning the camera around fast. So based on the above, I can't recommend this port until they make some good changes.

Update: Trying this again, version 1.0.3. Still runs like shit!

Update 2: Giving this another shot with latest drivers and version 1.0.4.1. While it performs better, CPU usage is still insanely high (lower than when it launched) for no reason, thus FPS is not stable and the overall performance is not yet ideal. GPU and VRAM usage have been greatly improved. I have also upgraded to 32 GB ram from 16 and my overall ram usage exceeds 18 GB and I don't have anything running in the background.

Update 3: Version 1.0.5. Game runs significantly better compared to launch but it's still not where it was supposed to be. At least now it's playable (at least for my hardware). I had stable 60 FPS on a mix of High and Ultra settings on 1080p for the majority of the game but CPU usage still remains above 70% and I really don't get why. Especially when there are no NPCS in the area or there's nothing going on. While the game is really good I still can't recommend it due to the atrocious state it launched in and it took so many updates just to get it into a playable state. I commend Naughty Dog for actually updating and fixing the game but it's not enough. We are in 2023. Games SHOULD and MUST launch in a better state especially when it's a triple A game like this published by companies like Sony. It really hurts me having to give it a thumbs down even though I really liked the game but it is what it is."

There was a couple of updates and they've fixed many of the problems I've originally experienced. I should maybe add that I've never experienced any crashes.
However, the fact is, the game is altogether poorly optimized and without a BEEFY ASS PC, you won't have a good time with it.

[STORY SPOILERS AHEAD]

1.0.1.5: new patch today, the framerate, gpu cpu usage and memory leaking issues seem to have been cleaned up a little bit but the game crashes more often now and always crashes in the first cutscene you meet Marlene in, pretty much the same place each time too. Using the oo2core from Warframe further improves these issues but only by a slight amount. still unplayable + crashes my steam deck every time after about 5 mins of shader compilation or after loading for a couple minutes, using GE7-47, Proton EX and Proton 7.06 all produce largely the same results with a few small deviations, if you really want to play it on the deck i reccommend Proton Experimental using the Low graphics settings [the default medium graphics are way too high for the deck]

1.0.1.6: stuttering is even worse in this hotfix, the crash on the previous cutscene [where you first meet marlene] has not occurred in this version for me, however it did crash in the cutscene where joel is sleeping on the couch in an apartment while it rains and ellie is *looking out the window before they leave town. Memory usage is a bit lower but still not exactly playable

1.0.1.7: stuttering is much worse again, crashes are so much more frequent, the experience on lowest settings on the Steam Deck [2TB NVME] is terrible, staying at around 1-3 FPS. This game is fucked if they can't fix this shit really soon, because it should have been fixed by now, they claim that they are fixing things but it just does not seem to be true, if you want to play this game just play it on PS3 / PS4 / PS5 or, better yet, PLAY DAYS GONE!!! :)

1.0.2.0: new patch just shipped yesterday, took me till now to load the shaders, i have started the game using the continue button, after about 5 seconds after loading it crashes i have tried this 4 times, once on the deck, and three times on my computer, i am not sure what happened with this update but there you go, for the few, precious, seconds i was in the game the framerate was around 20 FPS with all the settings at the lowest possible, AMD FSR 2.0 <3 at ultra performance with some major stuttering for a few seconds at a time but other than that, it worked fine enough till it crashed :/

***Change to 3440x1440***

1.0.2.1: mostly just the same, the stuttering seems to be a smidge better but the framerate seems bad, didnt crash with the short amount of testing i did though.

1.0.3.0: shaders compiling again, took about 2 - 3 hours, crashed twice at about 50% and 80%. finally shaders are done so i try to load into the game, took 10 mins to get to about 35% and then crashed, aint trying it again after that

***upgrade to 32GB RAM***
***upgrade CPU to Ryzen X3D***
***GPU drivers are up to date at what they recommend***

1.0.5.0: shaders again but this time it took about 30 minutes, still really bad but for what it's worth it has clearly improved a lot and is not that long anyway just frustrating, fps seems to have possibly improved and for the short while i played [5 minutes] the stability and stuttering were really good, i would definitely not buy it yet but its probably not a terrible experience if you meet the minimum specs but do be prepared for god awful graphics, if you meet recommenced however, it may be a decent experience. I am upgrading to a high end gaming GPU tomorrow so i will see how the performance is there, i apologise that i can no longer update my review based on my original specs, it was fun and i did miss a few revisions but if there is somehow, someone reading this then i hope you can enjoy this game either now or in the near future. thank you for reading, also if you are somehow still reading this then please consider trying out Days Gone, it is insanely good and if you like open world games then there you go. Again, thank you.

1.0.5.0 still: this time shaders took 20 minutes [for main story at least, also it got stuck on 98% and 99% for like 30 seconds each], the game recognised that I had installed a new GPU and set the graphics to the recommended for my GPU which was for whatever reason max settings. the main menu, while compiling shaders, is currently sitting at a nice, but unstable, 69 - 76 FPS. In game, in the 'downtown' area the framerate varies from 60 - 70 FPS by looking around but not straight up at the sky [looking up into the sky makes the FPS a maximum of 95, so yeah kinda unfair if we are getting an average of the area]. 



So I think the game is finally playable for me [with my original configuration] but me and many others should have had this experience when the game first released, not like almost a quarter of a year later. This is the reason that my review will always stay negative, even if they did a really good job of remastering the game [spoilers; they did the bare minimum] or making a great pc port [lmao], it was buggy as all hell when it first released, and thats just not cool."

EDIT:

This game gave me Kernel-Power 41 (63) error that made my PC shut itself down while the shaders were building in the main menu. This game is a pile of code junk that is ready to destroy your components.

[b] After experiencing the show and previous iterations of this game, I really really REALLY wanted to love the PC edition and finally get to play the remaster in all its graphical glory. Unfortunately, given the current state of the game, this is impossible. [/b]

[i] My Specs: CPU: i7 7700K | GPU: GTX 1080ti [/i]

Even on lower graphical settings, this game looks absolutely stunning, however with my specs above, I was barely able to keep 50fps on medium graphics downgrading to 1080p resolution. The need for a NASA computer to run this game at even a smooth 60fps honestly ruins most of the immersion for me and leaves me extremely disappointed overall. Seamless transitions between game play and cut-scenes are gone and instead replaced with jarring ""please wait"" signs overlaid onto the screen for between 30 seconds and 2minutes. These also occurred mid game play sections which further ruined the feeling of being immersed.  Also, 2 hours of playing and the shaders still haven't finished compiling? Insane.

Gameplay so far has been mostly enjoyable, however the AI of Tess in particular seemed extremely poor? Her character kept running around past enemies during stealth areas which honestly again just detracted from the game. I've also experienced several cases of characters glitching into objects and doing the dreaded T-POSE effect. 

Overall, I sincerely hope Naughty Dog do this remaster the justice it deserves because right now I'm honestly just disappointed and considering my hype before release, already find myself losing desire to continue playing, I wish I could give this a positive review but that would just be plainly untrue.

6774,3,0.37,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","Day one experience:
Simply horrible optimization/performance, compared to Resident Evil 4 remake, this game is simply a flop, I have already predicted it, and thank you for not disappointing me, just a waste really, and now I have to wait till the shader building is on 100% to even bother playing a game that I watched a TV show based on it, and been out for years in console, nice move though, just so no one be able to refund the game after 2 hours play time waiting their shader building to be done, well done.

Day two update:
Still left the whole shader crap to be done, launched the game, runs like crap with tons of fps drops, even way worse than how cyberpunk 2077 launched in release day, game freezes randomly during battles, stutters, and some voice stuttering here and there, simply runs as unfinished game, I tried messing around with the settings even tried the dlss ones, they somehow improved the quality and the fps in general, still the hard fps drops just ruins the experience and makes the game hardly playble or worth the suffering through the fps drops, luckily I didn't face any crashing issues yet, except the game froze up once with me.

Let's not forget the people who leave a ""thumb up"" review while complaining of the game issues, I have read multiple of them just to boost the review up to mixed, basically kissing on Sony's butt so Sony doesn't get mad and take their exclusive and go home and be mad on PC players, as if sony some little spoiled girl, and making that little girl is important so they don't fire your parents of work, when Sony is a multi billion company.

If they can't release a working game from their exclusive glorious console, better stop doing it and keep them for consoles.

After few patches and even a big patch, the game is still hardly playable, and even after finishing the game, there is really nothing else to do, I'm just surprised how this game was super hyped as one of the best games and the game play is very basic as if the game is really outdated from 2013, which was the actual release for it, the hardest puzzle in game is to find a ladder or a wooden thing so you can proceed to the next area.

The enemies just felt mindless and easy to abuse and fool around, the only times I died on was because of the game stuttering and dropping my fps which made my aim goes all the way around, I can say MAYBE the human enemies are anything, but other than that even the bloaters are a joke.

Honestly I can't say I had a blast, the HBO show somehow was having a better story telling than how it was in the game, which even almost made me feel like ""I know what gonna happen next"" since I already watched it, so the game didn't bring much to it, it's simply a re-re-remastered version of the 2013, people claim they ""remade"" the game when it's almost basically the exact same as the 2013 with few model faces, the graphics wasn't even that impressive and then you will have people trolling that you need a super decent PC to run it on max for the best graphics, nah it already looks outdated in general.

So my Negative review will remain, for multiple reasons, and I don't plan to change it, because simply I pre-ordered this game and I expected it to be actually good or at the very least playable, but nah, after every patch you have to wait for the shaders to build up and waste your time, if not the shaders building for more than 2 hours I would of already refunded it, and got it when it goes in a sale and fixed."

After two patches, my game is running a little better. I haven't suffered anymore graphical glitches, or super sudden FPS drops, but the game isn't running well. When i boot it, it usually stutters pretty badly for the first 5-10 minutes. Then it plays pretty well for the next hour or so before the stuttering it too unbearable to play anymore. Taxes the CPU pretty hard at seemingly random times as well.

1 month after release and I've completed the game fully, having to go through shader caching 4 times after each update 40mins to 1 hour each. And no, even after 4 patches (60GB total), the game has barely improved in performance on a 3060ti/5600x/32gb ram system.

• Overall Visuals - 8/10
	- Vast improvement over the original, but lacking by today's standards and features.
	- Level Design for a linear story game in parts is mind-boggling, with dozens of 	pointless alleys with no reward at the end of them for explorers (Why do this?).

• Mechanics - 5.5/10
	- Game mechanics have aged terribly since the original, spam pick-up gear > craft >
	repeat.
	- In a game about survival you'd expect the MC to know how to count bullets when 	they pick them up, but no, when missing just 1 bullet from a firearm both Joel & Ellie 	will make the leftovers disappear like magic!
	- Above average stealth mechanics.
	- Repeat of the same 3 level clear minigames.
	- Enjoyable and gratifying combat mechanics.
	- Bugs that have existed since the PS5 release are still present, one that forces you to
	skip a minigame, otherwise your save is soft-locked.

• Audio - 9.5/10
	- Very good audio accuracy and quality.
	- Audio sometimes desyncs in cinematics.

• Story - 8/10
	- Even though I knew the full story from years ago, it was still an enjoyable 	experience.
	- A medium-length linear story.

• DLC - 4/10
	- Wandering in an abandoned shopping mall simulator.
        - Performance is even worse than the main game.

• Performance - 2/10
	- FPS dips to 40s on a custom mix of low/medium/high settings @ 21:9 1440p 	resolution (vram usage 7.5gb).
	- 720p Low preset vram usage is over 6GB, even though the minimum specs 	recommend a 4GB GPU lole...
	- At specific angles objects in some levels will disappear.

• Pricing - 1/10
	- Perfect pricing for consumer pigs.
	- Laughable since the game has been out for 10 years...

• Overall - very light 5.5/10, absolutely terrible port, and a spit in the face of the PC master
race. Highly advised to find a free copy by LEGAL means.

Wait until Naughty Dog fixes this mess. There are minor bugs visually for example in the beginning of the game my screen would randomly become a texture mess with a bunch of colors just splattered all over my screen, and as my character would get attacked by zombies and reload the level, it would get worse and worse, and there are minor game play bugs and animation bugs that I encountered, some were game breaking while others were minimal bugs. It has crashed a few times while playing as well, I have had some instances where I was forced to reload the game/thought the game was going to crash due to sudden lag or stuttering (keep in mind my specs are in my opinion extremely above average). The characters sometimes block your way in certain missions, in the sewer section of the game Ellie blocked me from moving forward forcing me to restart my game. There is also a stuttering issue with KB&M, which is the main control for PC, this is mostly seen when using your mouse to move your view around at all and is very noticeable. My cpu also gets scarily hot and stays at 100% usage all the time while the game is running. Other than that this game is absolutely beautiful and stunning, story is amazing character design is immaculate and I am having a blast playing it, but the port is AWFUL, I cannot recommend this game in its current state and for SIXTY DOLLARS!?? There is a fierce disregard for PC optimization and with a month delay this is unacceptable, + a $60 price tag makes it unbelievable. I had extremely high hopes for this game but am dissatisfied in the product I received, Sony/Naughty Dog, we need clarity on these issues and fast. For these reasons I cant recommend this game especially for people who have lower end PC's.


[b]TLDR: Optimization bad, bugs, needs fixing! ASAP[/b]

For reference I played this on a LAPTOP  RTX 3080 + Ryzen 9 5900HS 

I got around 20 - 40 fps on ALL max settings with DLSS on quality and 1440p, and a solid 40 - 60 fps on the game recommended settings at 1440p with DLSS on performance. Keep in mind I am playing on a laptop screen. Even on the recommended settings I have not even been able to go past 60 fps with my specs which is shocking. 

I recommend waiting until the game is fixed and worked on continuously by the teams at Naughty Dog. Many of the other Sony ports have worked FLAWLESSLY, this game should not be treated any differently.This game is amazing, but as of now it requires you to have a NASA tier computer and two 4090's just to run it at above 60 fps. That is not right, I will be finishing the game as I already spent 70 dollars on the deluxe edition, and want to experience the rest, but I cant help to feel severely disappointed in this ports performance and am hopeful that the issues I addressed are swiftly attended to so many other PC users can enjoy this spectacular game on the many different types of PC's."

EDIT after 2 more hours: Learning the details about why I can't play the video game I bought, Iron Galaxy I can only assume were rushed to get this out by the end of the HBO show, or there just isn't enough talent there to be a viable source for reliable ports. Honestly pull the plug on the studio, it would do everyone in the gaming community a great service and it would help curb the flood of bad ports.

EDIT 2: After the patch on the 4th of april, shader cache takes even longer (before it was 45 minutes). I'm not going to bother to see if performance is better because I don't want to wait longer than an hour to play a video game.

EDIT 3: After Friday's Patch on the 7th of April, building shaders now only takes about 4 minutes which is a HUGE improvment. Very pleased to see that. However once I got in game, the framerate still isn't ideal. I got a modest base increase of 4-8 frames which is an improvement technically, however, the moment I got into combat with a clicker the game immediately crashed. Still an unplayable experience.

The most infuriating one is stuttering when moving around in the levels. They are probably not going to fix this, because there seems to be a flaw in the base code for this port, hence no patches for months. I love this game so much and to see it get treated this badly really stings. Also basic things like the Weapon Cross are so bad to control it is laughable. There was no thought made on how to correctly translate this onto PC for the Mouse and Keyboard Audience. Sony wanted a quick buck from PC Users and that's it. Look how good the Nixxes ports are! They aren't perfect, especially at launch, but they are really solid and even improve when they get feedback and learn more. Why can't this game get treated like this? What a disgrace.

UPDATE 3 (June 13th 2023): Yep, still runs like absolute dogwater.

UPDATE 2: Heeey, they fixed the mouse stuttering. Well the game still runs like hot garbage and turns out the whole stuttering issue was not all just the mouse movement but the dogwater performance plays a big part in this. Let's wait another few months, shall we? The state of PC Gaming is so laughable.


UPDATE 1: They still have not been able to fix the jitter/stutter when just moving your mouse. A basic PC feature. Moving your mouse. I don't know what to say. I am speechless.

I consider my PC slightly more above end then average: Ryzen 7 3800x, 32 GB of ram, rtx 2060 super, modern M.2 NVMe storage. While I mostly use this PC for VMs it is also built to be a gaming PC that can run most games at a frame rate above 120fps preferably 143 as that is my monitors refresh rate. It sure was a shoooocker to find that this port did not at all deliver in any performance factors at all. To start off the game is almost 100 gigabytes large which is some incredible bloat code for an eleven year old game and some how rivals call of duty games. After a 15 minute download (I HAVE GOOD INTERNET) I was greeted by the game compiling shaders for 30 minutes presumably to get around steams refund policy. Opening task manager I could see that the menu alone was using anyway between 80 to 99% of my CPU at random and was given my VRAM a run for its money. After shaders finished compiling I picked hard mode and attempted to load in to be greeted by a crash. The game crashed 2 more times within my 2 hours of gameplay but that is besides the point. The loading times for menus and stuff were abysmal considering I am loading the game off of one of the fastest storage devices on the market. In-game the fps is terrible and I am forced to turn down all of my graphics settings to low so that I can achieve 80 fps, so instead I stay of medium settings and cap my fps at 60. In settings motion blur is default which is a mistake because that chunks fps even more. The default controls for mouse and keyboard are bad, how come the only bind for medkit is 7? also quick turn should be removed because it is useless of m&k and I clicked it many times on accident. Luckily you can rebind all controls so these complaints are nullified. The price of the game is atrociously high especially considering they were giving this game away free with early PS4 releases. If you do not have money for this game and want to play it on PC but do not have the money RPCS3 are working towards getting comparable performance with this port, kek.

On to the good side. The game is a certified classic and super fun, but for this price range at this subpar performance I cannot recommend it.

6895,3,0.3829,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","*UPDATE 25/11/2023

The game has a great artstyle and great story-line. Yet, let's not forget how utterly horrible the release was. Unfortunately, there is no amount of work that Sony and Naughtydog can do to undo the horrible experience I had on release for a AAA title. The fact that they jacked up the price after release was very scummy, not to mention this game doesn't even include multiplayer is also pretty scummy. So yeah, my negative review will stand. F*** the greedy CEOs for releasing this product in such a state.

[strike]Not good impressions at all.

I tried pre-loading this game to get it up and running for a stream. The f***ing unpacking sequence was as long as f***ing preloading the game. Like, what the actual f*ck? Delaying the release by an hour and making me sit for another hour for just unpacking? It took as long as the install! WHY!

Furthermore, in all seriousness, I'm running an RTX 3070, Ryzen 9 5900X, and 64GB of CL 18 3600mhz RAM and all of a sudden, it's considered obsolete at this point? I can only run low settings? Are you kidding me? Not to mention, the game crashes every 20 minutes or so. Jeeze, this release was a mess.

In short, Sony, I dare you release Part II. The second that releases it's going to end up in the mostly negative reviews.

This is what happens when you trust a company like Iron Galaxy that has a long history of terrible PC ports. WHY???

*UPDATE

For those witnessing this horrible release, the game runs pretty decently in proton on Pop!_OS and for those who have a Debian based OS, I would recommend you try it there and see if it runs for you fairly smoothly. I got a consistant 60fps at medium settings on Linux and I'd expect about the same performance for anyone else using arch as well.

*UPDATE
I should also mention that turning on DLSS helped a ton. I can imagine that FSR would also help quite a bit, but I'm not sure since I don't have an AMD card. It seems like DLSS performance offers the most benefit to fix the issue right now. Literally, the game is only playable if you're able to run DLSS or FSR without completely tanking your FPS with a card under 10GB of VRAM. Pretty sad.

*UPDATE

Sad to report with even the latest 3 patches, including the recent Nvidia GPU patch, this game still runs like garbage. I'd still suggest staying away from this game for now until it gets better.[/strike]"

GPU: GTX 1080 Ti 12GB

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core

OS: Windows 10 64 Bit

RAM: RipJaws V Series 16GB DDR4




Desktop Version: This game's desktop version runs pretty okay after a year of this game being out with updates being constantly pushed out which to say the least isn't that amazing the game runs natively at High Settings for my setup albeit not at an amazing FPS the FPS typically sits at around 45 - 60 on High settings and only reaches above that at around 75 - 80 on Medium Settings the game still has some pretty major stuttering here and there but the game is most definitely playable it still takes up an insane amount of RAM to run but it runs decent and can be played.



Steam Deck Version: I do NOT recommend you play this game on the Steam Deck the game runs perfectly fine up until particles start showing up which is pretty bad cause there are a lot of particles in specific areas of the game, The game runs natively at Low settings and STILL runs terrible it took me from the epilogue to one of the first zombie fights before it started chugging hard I entered the little area with the guy trapped under the rubble and was immediately hit with a FPS drop that went down to about 8 FPS averaging it got so bad that I couldn't even use any of the buttons on my Steam Deck to exit out of it and my fans were running LOUD this game is not good on the Steam Deck and shouldn't be verified for it at all.



Final Thoughts: This game is still badly optimized even after almost a year of it being out on PC I honestly believe it shouldn't have released until atleast Late 2024 if your computer is lesser than maybe a GTX 1060 6GB and a i5-7400 I wouldn't recommend grabbing this game at all it takes up way too much RAM and only runs OKAY do not buy this game in it's current state unless you have a very powerful PC.

6912,1,0.6718,"run, setting, pc, fps, performance, port, even, low, still, well","Update after patch (7th April):

TLDR: VRAM

Performance is still pretty abysmal. Medium/low settings, 1440p downscaled to 720p and I can still barely get 60fps. CPU usage is still 100% whilst my GPU usage is sitting around 60% (probably because I had to downscale resolution because of VRAM). 

VRAM is the issue here and needs to be optimised more and properly. I'd say probably 85% of people on PC are using something with 8GB or less VRAM and considering cards as new as the 3070ti only have 8GB VRAM, it's unrealistic to expect a game to sell well on PC when a mixture of low and medium settings can't even play properly on above recommended hardware because of the VRAM usage. Even medium settings on 1080p use almost 8GB VRAM. 

Essentially - if your card only has 8GB of VRAM, no matter how good it is for any other game out there, the game's VRAM usage will cap you at medium graphics on 1080p and low/medium on 1440p, and, as I said in the original review, playing this game on anything lower than medium (with low in a few irrelevant settings) makes the game look worse than the original game looked on the PS3, which is insane to me considering that - had the original game been ported to PC, it probably would've had 10x better performance and also looked better than the low settings of this version. 


Original Review:

Can already tell this will probably be an unoptimised mess. Maxed out CPU (I have above recommended) in the menu and takes almost 8GB of VRAM for medium settings at 1080p. Also 45 minutes in and I've not even started the game because it's still only on ""Building Shaders: 30%"", at this rate it's going to take over 2 hours to build shaders which is beyond ridiculous and shouldn't be a thing unless you are literally playing on a potato with a HDD.

Edit of Original Review:

After over an hour of building shaders, I got into the game just to find that in order to get a relatively decent performance going (<60fps), I need to pretty much play a mix of medium and low settings - with the low settings making the game look worse than it did on the PS3 in some areas and still getting very bad stuttering and small freezes. Even turning DLSS (with 1440p) on did absolutely nothing for my performance. The optimisation is just bad.

Turns out this game is eating up nearly 10GB of VRAM at 1440p max settings (game defaulted the settings to maximum). I'm running a RTX 3080 Ti with 12GB VRAM, mind you. Never could get past the menu screen which always crashes when the game displays a notification at the bottom right corner that reads 'BUILDING SHADERS'. 

Coming from Iron Galaxy which did the decent port for UNCHARTED on PC, I'm very disappointed. I hope I'm eligible for a refund because I pre-purchased this more than 2 weeks ago. Those of you with lesser hardware be warned.

*Edit* Did some digging & found out these are the same b@stard$ that did the notorious port for Batman Arkham Knight. Refund on the way."

6917,3,0.2798,"release, really, review, go, say, year, see, know, come, make","EDIT Patch 1.0.1.6 - 31st March 2023: The game maxed out in 4K on my 4090 with no DLSS now uses circa 3.5GB vram less, and 4-5GB RAM less. From 17.5GB Vram (with what the game considers ""os vram usage"") and 31GB Ram, to 14GB VRAM and 27GB RAM

EDIT after 18h and having finished both the main game and DLC, plus 86% achievements, and like 80% of all collectibles in the whole game. To the problems that I mentioned before (in the rest of my review) add the following:
1) Entire chapters where the game runs between 23-31FPS (I completed it like this, thanks to my youth of low fps games). Thankfully I had Black Frame Insertion + GSync + VRR, otherwise it would have been even more horrible than it is.
2) There is a memory leak, the more you play the lower the FPS. After 3h it becomes unplayable.
3) For me the game crashed only once, 1h before the end of the game, once I entered a random room with 0 enemies or loot, so nothing crazy was happening. The game crashed so hard, that even after 10mins, I couldn't use Windows and I had to force reset the PC. The crash was so bad, poor windows started installing the latest updated on startup.
4) Frametime is horrible. You can have a stable FPS, but the frametime will vary by 5-10ms constantly.
5) The mouse feels like it skips frames.
6) Something I haven't encountered in the PS3 original,  PS4 remaster nor PS5 remake, characters TPosing in cutscenes and even during horse rides (which was pretty funny), and characters plus items clipping through the geometry and flickering a lot.
7) A lot of shimmering even without an upscaling technique applied.

The game is good as always, but don't buy this for now, the port is horrendous.


EDIT after 2h of playing:
1) The loading screens are everywhere and TAKE FOREVER. I can load Cyperpunk 2077 like 15 times in the amount this loads once. And this on a Crucial P3 nvme (3500MB/s read speed) and 128 thread @ 4Ghz CPU.
2) If you change any setting in the game, the game takes forever to reload the textures and all the changes. Many times it just stops halfway through, and just stay like that.

Changed the review to negative until they fix their stuff.

Played it for 1h, finished it 6 times on PS3 and PS4. The game is great, however the port is just decent:
1) The shader compilation take 55 years to complete (even though I am on a 128 thread cpu). So every time you update your graphics driver you will have wait 55 years.
2) The game literally pauses with a thumbnail every few minutes if you try to play while having the shaders compile in the background.
3) The mouse movement feels weird, similar to the uncharted port.
4) The 3D Sound Audio is bugged and during cutscenes (I haven't tried gameplay) will have very low volume to dialogue. I had to switch to Stereo to be able to play the game, 5.1, 7.1 or 3D Audio is just not good right now (Returnal works fine for example with 3D Sound).
5) The framerate is all over the place, even with a 4090.
6) No exclusive fullscreen available, similar to God of War or Uncharted. Therefore, any custom resolutions you may have, they are gone.
7) No ""PC Tech"" present. Nvidia Reflex (present in Spiderman and God of War) is not present here. Frame generation (present in Spiderman) is not present here. XeSS not present. DLAA not present. DRS cannot be used either.

So yeah, BIG thumbs up for the game, thumbs down for the port. This review is positive just cause TLOU1 is that good."

TLDR: Do not buy until they fix obvious port issues. The game is amazing as I played it on PS few years back but the port is clearly broken. 

First 5 minutes:
After few minutes the game presented few basic graphical options and then suddenly crashed. Generated report and sent it back to game devs.

I have updated graphic drivers, restarted computer and launched the game again. 

Remaining 7 minutes:
This time I managed to get to the main menu. I started the game and was presented with a message about ‘building shaders’. After another 6 minutes managed to get 5%.

REFUNDED THE GAME.

UPDATED 13/08/2023:
Purchased the game again as they 'fixed it'. Waited 28 minutes for shaders. Loaded up the campaign and... meh. I was so hyped for nothing. No visual improvements and it still stutters every now and then. Nothing major. I guess the initial mess they caused made me hate the game. I stand by my choice and support – fully polished games on release. Take that fixing s***t over few months away."

Happy to report the game is in a acceptable point right now. It runs acceptably on a 3070 now and still manages to look amazing on high settings with DLSS on. My review is still staying negative tho. Why you ask? Because we just can't go ahead and keep accepting this. The new norm in the AAA industry is release a broken game and then attempt to fix it months after. Some games do get fixed and some never do. Imagine if they delayed the game until now and it released today, the reviews would probably be sitting at overwhelmingly positive instead of mixed right now. They were clearly chasing the TV show hype train tho and just rushed it. Really hope this is an outlier when it comes to Sony ports and PC releases in general and that it's not gonna be the new norm."

Update: 4/14/23

So after many patches and hotfixes from not only Naughty Dog but also Nvidia, the game is in a mostly playable state and haven't experienced crashing as of now. Still experience minor graphical glitches though.

However, I'm still keeping my review at negative simply due to the practice of releasing broken ports at launch especially from a triple A company that should know better. I don't give a damn what you Sony shills have to say about it. Release a working product AT LAUNCH and you'll get my positive review.

Update: Game still runs pretty bad, but I managed to play on high settings 1440p with dlss on quality and I also locked the game on 60 fps. This made the game very stable with no crashes, but the game still sometimes dips below 60 fps. Updates made very little difference but not performance wise. Only crashes are less frequent and there are slightly faster loading times. This port is still and will be a big mess, I dont think they will ever fix it.
When it comes to the gameplay and story, it is probably the best game I have ever played. But I still can’t recommend the game for anyone unless you have really powerful rig (atleast rtx 3080 and better, with 8core cpu minimum). But you can’t ever be sure that the game will run fine even on the most powerful PC, because it is just a broken port.

I do hope this epistle finds you in good health and high spirits. It is with great pleasure that I impart a recent discovery that hath occupied much of my leisure. A game titled ""The Last of Us"" hath been procured on Steam.

I confess, this game is unlike any I have beheld before. It is situated in a world devastated by a fungal infestation, and the remnant survivors must fight for their very existence against infected humans and other perilous adversaries.

The game possesses an incredible sense of realism, with breathtaking graphics and sounds that ring true. I find myself completely absorbed in this wondrous world, and oftentimes I lose track of time whilst indulging.

Verily, some may view such indulgences as trivial, but I implore thee to remember that leisure and respite are essential, even amidst the flurry of our daily lives. Additionally, I have found that games, like ""The Last of Us,"" doth enhance my faculties, improving my analytical skills and logical reasoning.
