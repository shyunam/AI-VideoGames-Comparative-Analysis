7,3,0.4718,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Not really sure what all praise is about with this game its complete trash.  It’s unplayable because the camera will make you nauseated, it’s the same enemies and its the same area design throughout the game.  It’s just one big hub not really an open world in my opinion, takes you literally less than a minute to run on the other side.  It’s more like an arena... rather than an open world with out any different locations to see.
It doesnt feel completed, the world is empty devoid of anything interesting to see.  The terrain looks like dinosaur poop and you’re surrounded by it all the time.  The X button is used fore everything, running, dashing, jumping... Which creates a huge problem when trying to get away from enemies.  Physics in this game doesnt exist... Almost nothing in the world gets destroyed by your arrow grenades or your weapons.
Lets go back to the camera, you’re fixed to looking down towards the horizon.  When trying to look around especially while running the camera wobbles instead of making a smooth transition.  As you begin to run the camera centers itself on your character.  A horrible design and concept... The fov is horrendous as well.
The game is boring... It’s the same moves over and over again; granted you get special moves but they’re really not eye candy.  Then theres this nemesis thing, I could care less abou it.  The story is interesting and pretty gory.  The voice acting is spite on and the fighting is crisp but the camera makes it nearly impossible to enjoy it.
Stealth in this game is a big part of the game which can be stressful.  We play games to have fun not take a lecture every five minutes on what to press.  My God does this game have so many tutorial tips... The worst part you can disable it doing so and you’ll have no idea what to do or how to handle yourself.  If you can put up with the camera great, but just a warning it’s not really open world and its the same boring bosses with different aesthetics. Still waiting for a good lots game, just seems its never going to happen."

The combat is **** complete nonsense. Swords don't work that way. 1v1 or 1v3 is pretty fun, and it looks like the entire kit is built around dispatching 3-4 groups of enemies. When do you EVER fight 3-4 groups of enemies in the game? 1% of the time. Almost never.

It takes bloody ages to pick up your powerup in power struggles, and you have to do it or else 5000000000000000 other captains just happen to drive by. I've started a power struggle that went for 50 minutes straight because enemy captains just kept pouring in endlessly and endlessly and endlessly surrounded by more guys than dynasty warriors. I JUST WANT TO PICK UP MY DAMN LOOT FROM THE COUNTLESS I KILLED, GOD DAMN STOP SENDING IN ENEMIES.

It's a set of finely combat mechanics that doesn't bloody work with each other. It's like someone made a very good car chassis and a very good engine but the engine has no hope of ever fitting in the chassis, so they just glued the two together. This is bad game design."

11,3,0.5196,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","With Shadow of War rapidly approaching, many will choose to sate themselves with the first in the series, Shadow of Mordor. This review is for you guys, and hopefully you'll read it before buying. I'm not going to bog this down with credentials. Suffice, I've played enough for long enough, and know, above most things, objectivity is key.

Shadow of Mordor is not a good game. It's not the steaming pile it's made out to be by its harsher critics, no, but it's also not very good. Breaking it down piecemeal:

Fighting mechanics are stolen from Assassins Creed and the Batman series, fused into a simplistic three button counter dependent system that sits just slightly below AC's variety. Fighting bottlenecks in proportion to the number of enemies, meaning the more there are, the fewer options you have and the more you must comply with the game's ideal scripted fight scenario. It's all massively flashy, but also massively repetitive. Environmental attacks are possible, but often feel very scripted, thought there are quite a few varieties. The game is heavily inclined to sneaking, which it does passably, but not well, and being spotted is a common occurrence.

Weapon selection is limited to three, all of which you gain from the start. Runes can be used to improve them and give attributes, which is a good mechanic that was unfortunately shallow. Damage upgrades are earned in tailored 'proving' quests. Application of these weapons is dictated by skill tree progression. There is a sense of achievement in the skill tree, making you feel like you're gaining strength with each notch, but there is no real versatility. It is obvious what you need, and what you'll upgrade early (ranged attacks are useless, early finishers are essential). If you fail to recognize this, later engagements become terribly long suffered and some downright impossible.

Overland travel is limited, stunted and slow. An early game upgrade allows short dashes to be activated by leapfrogging rocks to get you where you need to be (yes, you read that right). Talion climbs well enough, but you'll begin to notice very clear passages and footholds to starkly defined second and third floors, which lifts the veil on what you considered to be a clever entry point.

Enemies are varied, and kill animations are numerous. But SOM also sadly illustrates a very good idea gone wrong in a very thoughtless way: Immunities. Some Orc captains are immune to numerous damage types. You can't sneak stab, can't use arrows for headshots, etc. The problem is, instead of improving the actual fighting mechanics or skill of these tougher orcs, the game simply adds immunities. This is a broken mechanic, and once more forces a bottleneck. In addition, when an opponent can only be killed by aerial takedown, but the nearest chest high wall is four miles away, I can't exactly invite him with a phonecall. Resistances, not immunites, would've been the step back that completely fixed this issue.

The story is shamefully weak for a Tolkien inspired game. Character roster is limited to about a dozen (including NPCs, excluding the procedurally generated orcs), and though these few are well realized (never let it be said the game lacks polish on character models) their backdrops, being the environments you find yourself in, are bland and feel very samey. It is understandable that the world has been ravaged, but that's not much of an excuse for the barren nature of it. You get the feeling that you're one of the last men on earth, and not in a good heroic ascension kind of way. As a character, Talion is strong and virtuous, but also very flat. There's no progression to his grief. And grief this man has (should have) much of.

Lastly, the nemesis system is essentially pokemon without visual battles, gyms or a final boss. Before you're sold on the hype and bootlicking, know that there are no benefits to 'finishing' it. It's a collect-a-thon with no payout. And with Talion's abysmal walking speed, intervening when necessary to advance your chosen orc becomes a case of racing to keep in-game appointments you're essentially setting for yourself.

I didn't enjoy SOM. It could've been much more and I think a lot of the love for it stems from the want for the old days of the intense LoTR games. But it isn't those games, and for an open world, it's surprisingly devoid of content. Everything is essential to your quest in becoming the greatest orc murderer there ever was, save for one or two Gollum missions added to break up the monotony. This is a shame, because it makes the world feel very dead.

I can only conclude that many reviewers here seem to have been raised on less than excellent value, game wise, to give such shining reviews. Don't get me wrong, it's okay for it to not be good, to enjoy a game for inherent elements that appeal to you. But objectivity is vital to improvement. And improvement, in the case of SOM, is a necessity if games that follow it are to rise above this"
12,3,0.8423,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This is a poor game. The combat is repetitious and the penalty for losing just one boss fight can be massive. The orcs try to have different personalities but they end up all sounding the same. I get the basis of the Nemesis system but its actual implementation in this game feels extremely forced.

There are WAY too many enemies that spawn and it seems endless. I understand that in order to defeat specific enemies one has to achieve combos, but it becomes impossible with the amount of enemies that spawn. There is no real direction to the game. You are thrown into the world with too many options and every way you turn from the very beginning it seems that you are over matched and enemies are too strong. The mechanics are okay and the games explains moves well, but the game is overwhelming with the amount of enemies and small space on the map.

21,2,0.2948,"control, button, bad, want, time, press, right, ever, shit, click","This game is like so many other pretty things: it looks nice but that's the only good thing you can say.

The Controls)

The controls for this game are without doubt the most atrocious, ill-conceived random mishmash of nonsense that I have ever seen in a game.  Button definitions are contextual, nothing new there, but the context changes so often that there is no way to memorize the controls.  The Square attacks, but if you hold down the stealth and tap some other button then it drops down from a ledge.  I count 15 button type controls on my PS4 stick, not counting the system control/option buttons.  As a game designer, if you have to resort to 3 button combinations to achieve your goals then you need to step back and reconsider your mappings and whether this game is really going to be playable.

I can't stress this enough.  This game is so complicated to play that I just eject the disc after 10 minutes or so and put it away for another month hopping it will improve with age.  It doesn't.

The Gameplay)

Poor control layout aside, the game does look very nice which just serves to antagonize me since I know I will never see very much of it.  So far, I have seen Orcs, slaves, and some cat-like thing.  The Orcs are easy enough to fight in 1s and 2s but they tend to come in packs once you get them riled up.  Good luck there.  My ranger gets beaten nearly to death (probably since I can't remember to R1+tap R2 while pressing X or some nonsense) and then the game pauses momentarily to give me some chance to do something.  I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do but it draws a circle on the screen and puts an arrow and I think it wants me to do something with the left or right stick.  Who knows.  I see that a lot and it's my warning that I'm going to die in about 5 seconds.  Time to get a sandwich and wait for the silly Nemesis system to promote and Orc.  I read a lot about what a wonderful thing the nemesis system is.  Maybe, but I see a lot of Orcs getting promoted (read more powerful) and I don't seem to be getting any better with these game mechanics.

The camera and the stealth (and the camera while stealthed) are also troubling.  The camera wants to re-center as I move and I find myself constantly fighting with he right stick.  This has the effect of making the movement a little sickening around corners and it makes the game feel numb.  That's a shame but wouldn't keep me from playing the game.

Stealth is darned handy but darned difficult to maintain.  You have to hold down a button constantly to stealth.  Wow, who thought that was a good idea.  Stealth is a necessity in this game since the wild array of randomly assigned controls is useless, kills mostly come from sneaking up on something and hitting it.  So I stealth a lot.  However, to stay stealthed, you must hold down R2 (I think it's R2) all the time.  That's amazing, though in a very bad way.

The Story)

Honestly, I can't say much about the story.  I can't get far enough into the game to really know if there is a story or not.  I'm playing in Story Mode, though I don't know if there is a free exploration mode or not.  Regardless, all I have seen are Orcs, slaves, and cat-like things.

Conclusion)

I've played games with marginal graphics and great controls that were fun but I can't say that I have ever played a game with great graphics and poor controls that was anything but a waste of money and time.  Shadow of Mordor is a fine example of a pretty game with ill-thought, poorly implemented controls.

Don't waste your time or your money unless your idea of a fun game is figuring out esoteric controls that are nearly impossible to remember and require vast dexterity (think hold down two buttons while tapping a third)."
22,3,0.4553,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","The Nemesis system is a great mechanic but the rest of the game is a big miss for me.  The plot is at sub-Destiny levels, and the main story can be finished in about 6 hours without rushing.  The small supporting cast is comprised of throw-away stereotypes and although Troy Baker is always good, Talion is just another boring white bread protagonist.  Others have mentioned camera issues, which I also agree with.  The combat is deeply unsatisfying and devolves into a button masher pretty quickly.  Ranged combat can be fun but is overpowered, and the stealth mechanic is horribly broken; most of the time you can ""stealth"" kill an enemy right in front of their pals and no one notices.  I played this directly after finishing DA:I and the entirety of the SoM area is about the size of the starting area in DA:I.

The problem for me is that there's nothing to do once you beat the very short ""story.""  Running from stronghold to stronghold fighting the same two enemy types by button mashing gets old quickly, especially given the insane respawn rate of enemies after you clear an area out.  Picked it up at a good discount so it was still worth the money, but overall this is a forgettable, mediocre experience hiding behind its fun Nemesis system."
23,3,0.5637,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I really wanted this game to be good. I tried playing it on three different occasions (thinking it was just me), but each time I played it - the game went completely flat after a couple of hours.

The gameplay mechanics are downright ripped off from Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkam - yet they aren't done as well. The open world could not be more boring and disappointing. In the end, this is a fighting game disguised as an open world adventure.

At it's very best, it's fun to hit the buttons for an hour to see some cool animations. Without that single component, I would have rated this game a 1. The graphics and sound are last generation polished up with stale overused voice acting. The story, well, there is none. Just an intro cliche revenge setup style cutscene and a ""go get em tiger."" Everything after that will put you to sleep.

The gameplay I would only recommend to someone entirely new to the gaming scene or a child who is easily entertained. Every single thing this game does has been done (years ago) and done much better. The nemesis system is a cool concept, but only leads to the same repetitive ""kill this guy, kill that guy"" scenario.

My gut told me that this game was going to be iffy, but it got so many good reviews from review sites. IGN gave this garbage a 9.3 and it's what led me to wasting 40 U.S. dollars on a game that I had to force myself to play multiple times only to come to the same conclusion that other negative reviews on metacritic have.

Ultimately, this is the 2014 version of an old school hack and slash that goes nowhere in the end."

In fact, I find myself forcing myself (unsuccessfully) to play just to try and get my moneys worth.  I will say this however.  Much of this is my own fault, for not looking into what the game actually was before I purchased it.  I saw a new LOTR game with decent ratings, had some extra money to spend, and bought it on a whim.  I was very disappointed by the fact that the entire game takes place in Mordor.  Yes, I know, the game title should have been a dead give away, but I didn't honestly think you could make a LOTR game all within the land of mordor.  What a shame.  I read ""Open world"".  Cool! I can finally play a LOTR game and go visit all those fond locations!  nope.  The environment is about what you would expect.  It's not that it looks bad, its just that it becomes very dull, very fast.  Everything looks the same after 10 minutes of play.  Everything plays the same within 10 minutes as well.  There's just no cohesion.  I feel as if I'm running around in circles, from one quest marker to the next (enough with the quest marker formula already).  It doesn't feel like I`m getting anywhere.  I would say that open world is not my thing, except that TESO games are some of my absolute favorites, so that argument doesn`t stand.  The combat is pretty dull in my opinion.  hack hack hack, counter, hack, groundkill, rinse and repeat.  There are so many enemies everywhere that even stealth stalking just feels insignificant.  Oh cool, I stealth killed an orc, too bad theres 50 more in every direction I look.  Just takes away from the impact of putting the effort in to stay in stealth, which by the way, you pretty much are forced to do when running anywhere.  I don`t know, I could go on, but really, I feel like I`ve wasted enough time and money in this game.  To put the effort in on a review of this game would just contribute to the waste.

Shadow of Mordor lacks a bit in that department. Gladiator-like, the story seems unoriginal, and tired.

Enemies become invulnerable to your every attack unless certain circumstances line up just right in a highly unlikely way. And those invulnerable will have all the missions include them so the game gets stuck.
2) Complex Quick time event, which is horrible to begin with, pop up behind the interface so even if you manage to get the the circles lined up, half the time you have no clue what button to it because of course that changes too.
3) 48 hours past game launch and still no prepurchase bonuses patched in to the game.

45,4,0.4241,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","The game feels like a poor Assassin's Creed rip off.

The camera is so bad that it becomes a challenge in itself. If you fight near a wall it completely goes crazy and points to random directions. It reminds me of old N64 games.

The stealth mechanics are bad. It's an open world most of the time, so the enemies just have super small sight. You can kill 3 enemies stealthly when they are all side by side and nobody notices. It's made to look like you are stealth, but in fact I think they found out that in LoTR orcs are deaf and have very poor vision. Also, there is no ""go behind the wall mechanics"", so when you go close to a wall, the camera focus on the wall and the controller gets clumsy (since you can't walk by the wall).

Combat mechanics are a bit better, but still clumsy. Fighting has lots of button smashing and the player moves in random directions sometimes. To compensate for the easiness of button smashing, the game throws tons of monsters at you at the same time. This changes the mechanic into: button smashing, run far from everyone (which you do faster than them anyway), wait for them to come in line, button smashing and repeat. Also, the bow mechanic is worse than Tomb Raider. The only ok point of the combat system is that you don't have to actually switch weapons (press square you use the sword, press R2/L2 you use the bow).
The open world part seems to be ok so far and the nemesis/famous orcs part works well. The respawn system is very aggressive (more than Destiny, for example). It means it is virtually impossible to get rid of all orcs in an area before killing the big guys. You kill a bunch of them, walk 15 steps, look back and there are more of them again. The only way to clear an area is killing the bug guys. It is designed like this because the fighting is very easy 1vs1."

49,3,0.8642,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","My feelings on Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor are complicated. On one hand, it feels like an incredibly shallow proof of concept with shoddy writing and all the hallmarks of mid-2010s open-world drivel. On the other, its shallowness is wrapped up in a pretty fun gameplay loop bolstered by the game's 'Nemesis' system, which is by no means perfect but by all means addictive.

If you're coming to this game like I was, looking for a satisfying tale set within Tolkien's Middle-earth, you will be massively disappointed. If you're coming into this for an open-world experience that's immersive and full of life, you will be massively disappointed. This game does one thing well and one thing only, and that's combat. It's a blend of Arkham's free-flow stylings and Assassin's Creed stealth that lacks the depth of both of those games but ratchets up the sense of power fulfillment with an excessive amount of upgrades and abilities that don't ever highlight strategy but instead highlight pure brutality. It's effortlessly mindless but always fun.

It helps that the 'Nemesis' system gives combat and the open world some sense of story because outside of that ingenious implementation of AI programming, Shadow of Mordor lacks personality otherwise. Its open world is well-crafted and intensely atmospheric, but they do nothing with it which sucks. It's an empty playground of potential where endless tutorials for mind-numbingly simple combat are left to rot.

While I had my fun, it was fun wrapped up in disappointment of what felt like an unfinished passion project that slaps trends together with IP to create something vapid with just enough passion for the source material to keep the game from being forgotten."

54,3,0.7403,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","How was this a GOTY in 2014?

First of all, the story is pretty weak, and I dare say that If it wasn't for its mild connection to the LotR universe, there wouldn't be anything to write home about, mainly because as a whole, it makes no sense. You start of with a sense of ""ok, this just happened"" and you will continue to experience the same sort of empty, uninteresting feeling throughout. At its core, it's supposed to be a revenge story, but there isn't enough of a connection with the main character to truly understand his emotions and feelings. And don't get me started on the ending...what the hell was that? Seriously? The villains are also pathetic.

Then there is the other side of the coin, the ghost/wraith you interact with...now that wraith, at least, has an intriguing, albeit stupid story (from a LotR perspective), but you can at least sort of recognize why it makes the choices it does. So this sort of saves the main storyline, which honestly is just a thin veil placed above the real meat of the game - the gameplay and the nemesis system.

If you've ever played Assassin's Creed, Batman Arkham, or maybe Mad Max, you will be able to recognize the combat system, it's very much a mishmash of those games, with some slight differences in the form of unique wraith abilities, like a ghost shockwave and such. There are also some stealth mechanics, but they're hit or miss, and interestingly, despite this lesser but still important focus on stealth (bushes/stealth finishers), the system is pretty barebones, at least when compared with Batman/AC. But again, the wraith mechanics save it, somewhat (with teleporting stealth kills, for example).

All in all, the combat is ok, and I really liked its emphasis on finishers of all kind, especially some of the abilities you get later in the game. I do have to point out that the devs tried to diversify the arkham style combat the game has, and it works, up until you get deep into the nemesis system.

The system itself is neat - you have to work with/kill/use orcs, who act in a hierarchy which you can exploit to your liking. This is then joined by a very interactive reputation system, which designs how powerful/weak the orcs get based on your revolving encounters with them. So If you had lit an orc on fire in a previous encounter and they escaped, they'd return with burns and perhaps also with an immunity to fire. It's pretty cool.

You can go as far as to create an ultimate nemesis, who would be impossible to kill thanks to numerous resistances they have built up, which can make or break your enjoyment of the game.

For me, these resistances/encounters were very annoying, and I despised any combat encounter I had to endure with higher level orcs just because they took incredibly long to kill. Or I just died and made them stronger, leading to even worse future encounters. I admit that this is very subjective, but essentially, you create and influence the difficulty of the game as well this way, which I really wasn't a fan of. Dynamic difficulties can be very 50/50 on whether they'll help you enjoy the game or not. Likewise, the game is very repetitive, since most of the stuff you do is just orc killing. Not very fulfilling.

Now onto the world...this game came out in 2014, right? So you'd expect a very lush, detailed world. And while the graphics can be nice, the world itself is boring. I'd say that it feels like a PS2 level game world with better graphics. The open world, sans the nemesis system, is static, populated by orcs/monsters, which in itself wouldn't be a problem, but then you also encounter friendly NPCs who, for some reason, live outside the bounds of this world, instead of in it in some neutral town/cave you can visit to make the world feel more lived in.

On the musical front...eh. Generic.

Overall, I'm quite disappointed after finishing the main game. The DLC, from what I've played, feel like the same thing over again as the main game, so I'm gonna be skipping them in all likelihood. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad game, it's like a 6 or 7/10. But why would I recommend anyone play this, if the only really good thing (depending on how one sees it) is the nemesis system and maybe the graphics, sometimes? 

Skip it and play an Arkham game. Or maybe Mad Max, that game is awesome, even if repetitive at times, but its positives more than make up for its negatives."

So, I've played through the entire game and 2 out of the 3 DLCs (the last one is just a challenge map DLC, not my kinda thing). I've grouped the DLC review separately at the bottom if you’re interested, especially since the GOTY edition is the only one on sale on Steam. 
Here are my thoughts:

[h3]Story:[/h3]
First things first, if you’re not into Lord of The Rings and coming to this for the story, you're going to be disappointed. 
Is the story good? I'd say its alright. Its a very basic revenge plot which as far as I'm concerned is a preeeeetttttty dull one with no twists and an uninspired ending. Although it does add lore to the already present LOTR universe, and it has Gollum! No, not like that other game, this one actually did him quite well! 
I'm currently reading through the LOTR books and I'm gonna be honest with you, the story would have probably been way more fun if I had waited to finish them before playing this, and that's what I'll be doing for Shadow of War (now in my backlog). As for this game, its a bit too late to do that so everything I’m telling is you is as someone who wasn't a LOTR fan at the time of playing this game. In total, I'd give the story a C+. Nothing to brag about but it does its job.
The characters are... alright. There's moments where the writing is 10/10 and other moments where I'm going ""what the heck are these people saying?"". The main character has his moments where you think he’s the most boring man on the planet but unlike most brooding characters they actually show you how he got there (that's about as much as I can tell you without spoiling it), so you can understand why he's not exactly joking about every chance he gets. Still, there are moments where his older personality shines through the cracks, and those beget some of the most wholesome moments in the entire game.

[h3]Gameplay:[/h3]
This is why I bought the game in the first place. I had just finished the Arkham series and wanted more of its sweet sweet combat and from what I could gather, the gameplay was apparently similar between the two games, and lemme tell you, those reviews weren't kidding. No, seriously, if you're coming from the Arkham games, it'll take you a sum total of 20 seconds to figure out the controls and feel right at home, and since they slowly drip feed you more abilities as the story progresses it never feels like you’re being overwhelmed with them. 
As for the stealth aspect, its literally just Assassins Creed. They have everything from air assassinations to throwing knives to climbing every structure imaginable. and the one separating factor is a few magical powers that aren't present in the AC games.
There's one more similarity: Synchronization towers. They're not called that obviously, but they're there no matter whether you love ‘em or hate ‘em. Also the 'Go here do same side challenge a hundred times' mission exists as well for those of you masochists who love that sorta thing! Don't you just love doing the exact same thing over and over again? /s

So how does it all work together for this game? If you're anything like me, you must have thought that sounds like the dream, and you'd have been right if it didn't get so UNBELIEVABLY DULL once you get through the first 3-5 hours. I don't know why it is, but for whatever reason they decided that a difficulty slider wasn't important, meaning if you’ve played any videogame that involves even an inkling of basic combat, you’re gonna find this one way too easy within a couple hours playtime. In fact, at one point I got so bored from the game being too easy that I just stopped buying power ups for the remainder of the game, which to be fair did improve the difficulty a bit. Also the devs thought it would be a good idea to give you the headline skill/power that makes the game interesting around about 2 hours before you're done with the story! I really don't understand that decision since its one of the best parts of the game! 

[h3]The Nemesis System:[/h3]
[b]The crown jewel.[/b]
The one thing that makes this game anything at all. This is the most memorable part of the game by a country mile and gave me so many fun little moments and made the world feel so much more alive. To make the long story short, there's an entire army of orcs you have to take down during the entire game, but the system is dynamic, meaning the game automatically selects and promotes orcs to certain posts when you kill their Warchiefs, etc. This means you can never let your guard down throughout the game. Wanna kill the whole army and then do the story from start to finish? Expect to have that army back bigger and angrier within a few hours. You might find that draining, but trust me when I say its what kept me going. The Warchiefs and their lieutenants all have their own personalities and say genuinely funny(or creepy) lines whenever they come into contact with you, making it feel like you're fighting genuine individuals and not just random NPCs. 
Died from a Warchief's blow and respawned to come back and kill him? He'll remember the previous attempt and make fun of you for falling by his hands. 
Died from the arrow of an archer? He'll get promoted for taking you out, making him more powerful (boastful too if he's got that kinda personality).
Each enemy has his own strengths, weaknesses and flair! It's brilliant, I wish we had this system in every other game out there, because its the best thing I've come across that you cant find in other games. I do hope that it comes back to a modern game some day, since its just that good.

[h3]Performance and Art style:[/h3]
I had zero performance issues on my GTX 1650, I highly doubt you will either. You could easily run this game on high settings 60 FPS if you have a graphics card from the past 7 years so don't worry about it all that much.
Graphics are nothing to scoff at, not amazing, not horrible. Some aspects of it hold up quite well for 2024, such as the characters textures and light gleaming off the swords on his back, whereas others  parts have not aged so gracefully.
The art direction is dreary and gloomy, and doesn't really ever take a turn from it. All the areas look the same and I struggled to find my way anywhere without staring at the map the entire time. Personally I'm not a fan, but hey maybe you'd think differently. The game oozes that early 2010’s depressing blue green filter and I’ll be honest, I got tired of it quick. 

[h3]The DLC:[/h3]
[b]Lord of the Hunt:[/b]
Laziest piece of work I've ever seen. Its clear the devs were told to make a DLC and given a sum total of 10 hours to make it, the entire thing can be beaten in less than 2 hours. It adds a bit of gameplay but honestly its meh at best and I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on it if you've got a large backlog.
[b]The Bright Lord:[/b]
Its a sort of mini-prequel to the game and adds story elements to it. This was actually a fun 2-3 hours! Remember that skill I told you they give you 2 hours before the game ends and I wanted more of? Well apparently someone at Monolith thought the same way I did because the entire damn DLC revolves around it. Am I mad? No. Its a good couple of hours of fun and I recommend it to anyone who finishes the base game.

[h3]CONCLUSION:[/h3]
So dear reader, should you buy this game? That depends on the following:
Are you a fan of the Arkham series, Assassins Creed, and especially LOTR? Then yes, get it.
Are you a fan of Arkham or AC, but not LOTR? I’d recommend saving your money and going elsewhere for a better experience.
Are you a fan of LOTR and want the extra lore? Go for it, you’d probably enjoy it a lot more than the rest of us.
Finally, DO NOT buy this game unless its on discount, which at this point is nearly every other month anyway.

The game is similar to GR: Wildlands and Crackdown, games where you have to systematically take down an enemy faction via killing the boss/warchief's underlings. But this game adds a lot of personality to the orcs to the point where they're far more interesting than the main characters.

Gameplay is not bad per se, but just like the aforementioned games, it gets pretty repetitive (Arkham melee and watered down Assassin's creed stealth). The whole game is centered around the quirky orcs and the ""Nemesis system"". Most of the fun comes from the anticipation of what the orc's next dialogue is going to be; but, on its core, it really is all the same and doesn't particularly affect the plot in any way regardless of what it's told. You stop caring about what they'll say or do after a few recruits."

- Combat is fluent most of the times, i.e, if you're not close to a wall/box.

- High spawn frequency, you could kill 20+ orcs walk a few meters turn back with all of them spawned anew.

Really do but it's like swimming in jello with controls that are so wonky I just can't get past the frustration of knowing what I want to do but not being able to do it while playing. So frustrating. 
Graphics and visuals are epic. Movies are amazing. 
Game-play and design choices are seriously lacking:
*Mapping of buttons/keys is not intuitive. Layout not remotely like similar games.
*Character defaults to very slow movement. Turning to face an enemy is also painfully slow. [A] is sprint on X-Box controller.
*Must HOLD a button to crouch (not like most games where it's a toggle situation). Very un-intuitive seeing as how the beginning is all stealth...because you're easier to kill than any souls game.

I'll try it again in a bit but so far it's not been a fun thing on my second attempt (bought it when it first came out and left it because it was so frustrating)."
97,1,0.3893,"open, computer, video, bug, close, buck, hate, damn, error, patch","This game is the definition of slop. A disgusting, slurry sludge utterly devoid of creative soul. This game is conceptually front-loaded and bombs hard two-thirds of the way through. I hated every character except Ratbag the Orc and Torvin the Dwarf, whom I merely tolerated (though they definitely outstayed their welcome). They legitimately expected you to care about the paper-thin ""characters"" supported by some of the most phoned-in voice acting I've seen outside of indie games. And if you care about the lore of ACTUAL Lord of the Rings, this garbage fire will simply add insult to injury.

As to the game; I'd rather play Arkham Asylum's demanding but tuned combat than ever wade into this slipshod shitshow. It's perfectly fine if your attacks bug out; you clip into something; your i-frames drop too early in an animation; THE ANIMATION DIDN'T HAVE I-FRAMES TO BEGIN WITH; none of these things really matter because they just widened the margin for error. That's fine if your game is a soulless product whose legacy is the two weeks that it exists in the mainstream public consciousness before the next big release. When measured against games with systems to be mastered, it is abject failure. ""But it's fine, surely they know it's slop and thus wouldn't put anything in the game which requires mastery to complete, right?"" WRONG. The challenges tied to the DLC campaign The Bright Lord require mechanical mastery. The DLC Lord of the Hunt requires mastery AND a healthy dose of luck. 

There is no humility to this game. It is a product, made to order for corporate overlords. It ticks all the mandated boxes, and the only concern it has for players is how to trap them in a serviceable Skinner Box. Every last detail has been meticulously crafted to be as inoffensively bland as possible. I hate trash like this more than I hate bad games."
98,4,0.4277,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","--Shadow of Mordor is a sandbox for slaughtering infinite orks. The play time is extended by escort missions with lots of walking, incessant and overly-used slowmos, intro demos for dozens of mini-bosses, and extended demos in general, for it's unengaging story.

--The maps do not seem too small at first, but you have to spend so much time running in circles that you will quickly memorize them and get bored of the samey encounters.

--The encounters themselves are a complete waste of time, as enemies will spawn infinitely. This motivates the player to sneak around and assassinate key guards, as this tends to be the best way to resolve all missions. This sounds fine on paper and can be fun, but can also get tedious with how slow and unwieldy wall climbing is.

--The only times you do want to get into combat is to kill boss enemies. This is where the player learns that combat boils down to three buttons. Mash attack or defense, line up enough hits to enable one finisher. It is not possible to lock onto a single enemy during combat, so when you press the finisher button, the game will most likely use it on one of the random, infinitely spawning mooks, even though you are standing next to a boss enemy. So... rinse and repeat.

--It is natural for the player to be at a disadvantage if cornered into a tight space or surrounded. But in Shadow of Mordor there is an added hindrance in this type of situation, as it will often cause the camera to behave awkwardly and become stuck inside the player's character model, severely limiting the player's view. Just standing close to a wall can cause this camera issue.

--Even worse, if you do get cornered or low on health and need to disengage, the fiddly wall climbing commands just might get you stuck in place instead. Especially since some of the movement buttons have multiple functions, so you might dodge in place and tank hits instead of jumping off a ledge, or you may accidentally attack a large patrol, since the button to drop one level down while wall climbing can also cause the player character to launch an attack from above, on a target automatically acquired outside of the player’s FOV.

--Speaking of controls, Shadow of Mordor has a rather complicated control scheme, but you will wind up not using most of it. As mentioned, this is a three button game. Well, four buttons actually. You will sometimes need to press the dodge key as well. 

--The nemesis system seems interesting at first, but then you realize you have to listen to overly long voice lines each time you encounter a captain or warchief, and that their strength and weaknesses are rolled randomly, causing some of them to be a pushover, while others are virtually unkillable. The environment you encounter them in also seems to be random, and it will wildly affect the difficulty of the battle. 

--Face and body movement are mostly very well animated, the voice acting is decent, although sometimes recorded at varying quality. The best part of this game may be its BGM, which is fun, dynamic and will respond to the situations the player is in.

--The many accolades Shadow of Mordor received when it was published always confused me. The same year saw the release of much better combat systems and campaigns. While Shadow of Mordor sounds interesting on paper, the game's systems have an uncharming kind of jank to them, and work against each other, making this game ultimately feel like a chore."

Emjoy taking care of every enemy boss or otherwise by mashing X and Triangle over and over.

Crazy to think this franchise died after two games when the characters, story and dialogue are so bland and you arent rewarded for collecting a bunch of bs collectibles, your character stops dead in his tracks and cant move frequently or dives to the bottom of the map when there is a ledge to jump to 0.5m from his face or has his executions lock onto the wrong person or cant jump up on something for three tries but suddenly has no problems jumping onto the exact same thing.

Almost a decade after it's release, it feels largely anonymous through no fault of its own. If you've played any game that could nebulously be described as ""open world action adventure with light stealth, resource gathering &/or RPG elements)"" in the last ten years, you've already played Shadow of Mordor. The Do Not Recommend sticker is less about this game being particularly poor, it's more that it's difficult to recommend this individual game over its ilk.

109,3,0.8238,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Where to begin with this one. The story is forgettable and boring. The main character's motivation is a revenge plot for two characters the player meets for maybe 3 total minutes before they die. In other words, you could care less whether or not the PC gets his revenge. The setting of LOTR's feels like window dressing and doesn't do a good job of adding to an interesting setting or capturing what makes the world Tolkien created so special. It feels like it only uses the LOTR's IP as a way to sell more copies. The side quests are boring arcade style challenge levels. The characters you meet are generic and never get enough screen time to land, this game has one great system and that is the Orc Warlord/Army mechanic where you can command your own warband to kill other orcs. That is really the only fun factor, and makes this game worth playing at all. The combat is a clone of the Batman Arkham games, but doesn't quite meet the standard set by that trilogy. The main three bosses in the game are extremely under cooked. The final boss of the game is three quick time events and then the credits roll.  All and all I think this game was built around an interesting concept but is boring, generic or just flat out bad in every other category. The game feels more like a proof of concept, especially when it only took me about 10 hours to beet. The one benefit of that is though, it definitely doesn't drag on longer than it needs to."

It makes no sense that you can kill an enemy in 5 or 6 strikes normalls but if you stun them they become invincible as long as you dont perform the finisher. The writing is mediocre and the missions are boring and its still. This game is terrible. It was designed to be boring and a time waste and accidentally made a fun side game with the nemesis system this is a boring cookie cutter assasins ubisoft. There is a character that you have a mission with to find his wife. The mission requires picking flowers for about 5 minutes then sudden fail state stealth sections. during the 5 minutes of picking flowers his stupid commentary is so annoying you have to mute the game.  I shot him in the head at first when he would blah de blah but he was invincible so mute was a better choice. Even the nemesis system is kinda stupid when you die before you can start again you have to skip through every command position change since you died last. after 70 hours I hate this game. The people who worked on it must have been tortured as most intentional written scripted events and combat are soulless and boring. The game has an endless fun loop with the vengance loop but when the developer is so lazy that sprint is jump is wall climb it is not surprising that navigation is annoying and tedious. There is a mission where you have to shoot from a caragore. this is a failed design. you max carry 8 shots and you need to shoot 10 head shots but you cant get more elf shot from atop the mount. trying to play the game as laid out in missions is an insult to the concept of fun. This game is fun only when it doesn't mean to be. It is obvious the company was being gutted inside out for micro transaction i just am very angry because in spite of their incompetent laziness they almost created a masterpiece: the mistakes  that it contains however are just so stupid.

This game could have been great but is a mess of laces and bad concept face down in the mud. in 2024 this game feels like a cross between dynasty warriors batman which is where it is amazing and then all the trailing missions from assasins creeed and combat that starts to be complex only to fall by the way side to complete boring hit stun rack up 5 perform an execution rinse and repeat with dynasty style head shots. Dynasty warriors took about 4 hours to get over. This one took 70 because i did everything that was fun. after finally completing the grog poisoning missions, i just wanted to kill the slave outcast for being so annoying and walking too slow and then too fast.

[b]Whether you love the books or the Peter Jackson adaptations, I don't think this is a good game for Tolkien fans at all.[/b] The movies understandably trimmed down most of the books' layers and shifted the focus more toward drama and plot. The necessities of making a good video game demand such a shift even further. However, ""Shadow of Mordor"" released in an era of epic and thoughtful fantasy games, from action-adventures to RPGs. Making a Tolkien game with a gameplay loop this brutish, an environment this dull, and story and lore this butchered, is simply inexcusable. Finally, I'll say it: The nemesis system is overrated. ""Argh, zoom in on my face! I am an enemy you have encountered before but did not eliminate. I am angry at you now!""

[b]Usually, a cool license can make an otherwise terrible game passable.[/b] This is the only case I can think of that achieves the opposite: This mediocre piece of crap is actually delusional enough to believe its story and gameplay justify ripping character designs and names straight out of Tolkien, the richest source material possible, which turns ""Shadow of Mordor"" from a passable game into a terrible game. It's impossible to enjoy the mindless action for what it is without being reminded of how much it butchers Tolkien, not just the lore but also the visual storytelling of the movie adaptations. Meanwhile, people who don't care about Tolkien are probably not going to get more excited about [i]these[/i] orcs than any other standard fantasy orcs.

[h3]I can only conclude ...[/h3]
[b]... that all of these positive reviews stem from either young children or extremely open-minded fans of the Peter Jackson adaptations.[/b] Maybe they've only seen trailers or Youtube clips, or have bought other merchandise, or like to fast-forward to the fight scenes. I don't know. So if you fall into one of these two categories, and just want to endlessly ride wargs, chop down enemies, and free captives, and don't mind how samey it all is, you can probably safely go for the GOTY edition even at full price, and more power to you. But if you love anything Tolkien, you'll only be struck by the complete lack of beauty, variety, and adventure, until the forced cameos and lore obliterations finally cross your personal tolerance threshold and you decide to dip out."
119,3,0.5909,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","An incredibly mediocre adventure achieved through paint-by-numbers design filled with watered down mechanics copied from Assassin's Creed 2 and Arkham. No depth to the characters. The story doesn't start as much as it just happens - no scenes of the two protagonists getting to know each other or have interesting conversations, they just work together and their dialogue consists of reiterations of the task at hand. I don't think Ranger Dude ever even asked Elf Guy who he was or vice versa. No reason to care about Ranger Dude, the gruff beard guy who kills lotsa orcs and demonstrates no personality while he is on his cliche quest to avenge his personality-devoid family that had a total of 5 minutes of screentime before being killed. The beginning of the story feels like something the devs desperately wanted to get out of the way rather than use it as a valuable opportunity for world-building, exploration, and setting up characters.

I thought LotR was supposed to be about epic journeys, friendship, charming characters, and beautiful landscapes - the fight scenes where they behead orcs and scary Mordor were a small part of the journey and served to punctuate it with spectacle, but Monolith tried to make a whole game out of it. It feels like it was made by people who didn't understand LotR and only paid attention to the fight scenes in the movies. Two gruff guys brutally slice orcs to pieces - very impressive if you're a teenager who is obsessed with exaggerated gore. Gollum shows up so you can point at the screen and exclaim that you remember him from the movies, except his facial animation lacks any expression, which goes for everyone else as well. The one character who I kinda liked was Ratbag, the orc that Ranger Dude recruits as a spy.

The combat is a drag and lacks depth. The content is repetitive and there is endlessly generated content relating to the orc captains that doesn't warrant wasting any time on. There is no point to freeing slaves or clearing out locations, as orcs respawn very quickly - you won't have the time to leave a stronghold before half the garrison respawns.

The missions consist of boring main missions and side missions like - kill orc captain and goons, free three prisoners, complete a short combat/archery/stealth challenge. Each has optional objectives like ""kill 3 enemies with stealth attacks"" or ""kill 5 enemies with headshots"" to pad out the sheer lack of engaging design or gameplay. Like the story, the missions don't start as much as they happen. Why is Ranger Dude stealth killing 10 orcs in this outpost? How did he come across the mission? Is it important for some reason? Why specifically stealth kill them? Why do the optional objective? The answer is ""because a marker appeared on the map and you walked into it and pressed ""start mission""."" There's a sentence-long description that says stuff like, ""Ranger Dude is very good at killing orcs, one time he killed 50 of them, it was very scary and cool.""

The controls strain your fingers for no reason. Ranger Dude has two speeds - walking and running. Walking is very slow, running is very fast - too fast for tighter environments. It would have been much better for exploration, stealth, and combat if there was a speed in the middle. To run, you have to hold down A on the controller. You'll be doing that for much of the game, which isn't great for the thumb and also restricts camera movement. To sneak, you have to hold down Right Trigger. Why not just have stealth mode be a toggle? Controls cannot be remapped on the controller.

Graphics are decent for 2014 on a technical level, but there is nothing interesting to look at in this game's drab rendition of an intentionally barren and depressive landscape, nor does the world warrant any deeper interaction or exploration beyond following the markers. Character designs aren't interesting nor graphically impressive. Field of view is way zoomed in - I had to  use Flawless Widescreen to make it higher by 15 points.

If you want a good revenge story and open-world action game, look at Assassin's Creed II: much more vibrant world, charming characters, and a real sense of gameplay, world, and story progression. For pure gameplay, Shadow of Mordor is made completely obsolete by Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey, which have much more functional stealth, climbing, more interesting and varied content, open-ended gameplay, beautiful worlds, and more serviceable combat for a long open-world game. I don't know who the story in Shadow of Mordor would interest, as hardcore LotR fans would be too busy pointing out the lore inconsistencies to enjoy the gruff guy rampage for edgy teens. I barely got halfway through the game before giving up because of how boring and dry the whole experience was."

Also the idea that when you die all leaders get stronger is a weird concept and make the game not fun at all. The keys combinations are old as well click X+A and also not responsive. You can't tell what % life left from normal orc, only the leader has a visual indication, which make it hard to identify which orc is getting weaker.

[*]The Controls... I don't know if it was ported that shitty or if it was designed that way, but 19 out of 20 deaths were because I was facing forward, moving forward, but the game decided I wanted to jump off to the right, or some other stupid shit like that... During combat it's about impossible to attack the opponent you want to, there's such input lag that it's awful (even if I press the counter button, I still get stunlocked because it tries to perform the actions two actions before without success). I won't say I was raging, but I wasn't far from throwing the monitor out the window.

[*]The game gets repetitive very quickly, which it tries to spice up with lore and other diary entries - sometimes with interesting stories, sometimes with completely uninteresting stuff. 
[*]About halfway through the game, I had all my abilities maxed out - but it didn't really matter, I was either killing about anyone with one or two executions or I was in stunlock, from which I couldn't get out alive no matter what I did.

[*]One main quest is completely pointless... The start can be explained, after that it was put in just to add some variety to the game, but it's short and completely unjustified, as fast as it came, it disappears...

[*]Bad puns and references from the movie and the books

[*]The endgame... It's disappointing in the extreme: [spoiler] You fight your way through a bunch of orcs, sweat blood to do the bonus quests, restart a stealth mission countless times because (and here I refer back to the bad controls) you've run into it a hundred times for the whole game... and after that the two biggest bosses die after pressing about 3 buttons at the right moment... REALLY???? IS THIS THE EPIC ENDGAME??? And not only was the ending unsatisfying as a game, but the story was so full of holes that I didn't even feel like looking at the credits, I quit immediately...[/spoiler]

I'd really like to say it was a good game and I recommend it wholeheartedly- because it had it's moments - maybe I'm nitpicking and will come back and give it a positive review at some point, but at the moment I feel like I've put in 40 hours just to say I played through it, but it felt more like a chore to get the game going than a thrill or fun. I'm not even angry, I'm dissapointed.

Positives:

- Unique and very entertaining Nemesis System

Negatives:

- One (sometimes two) button tapping battle mechanics which makes me feel like I'm trying put myself to sleep by playing Cookie Clicker

- Mostly fighting in-game badly made uncustomazable inputs instead of enemies.
Even if you play on keyboard & mouse, it still feels like you're trying to make drunkard walk in a straight line since it takes 10+ seconds to register at least once any button you're currently spamming. Looks so absurdly bad when I'm spamming the hell out of a single ""RB"" button for like 8 seconds straight standing in front of paper intel on the table to just... look at it. Same amount of time game needs to spot any interactibles in front of your character, so add this to previous 10+ sec waiting queue.

130,2,0.355,"control, button, bad, want, time, press, right, ever, shit, click",Game is just not optimized for PC. Has a terrible mouse acceleration that is very difficult to control. Gonna push through the rest of the game but it's bad...
131,4,0.6564,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","You should play this game but only if you can get past the accessibility issues this game has.
This is a fun game for the most part but there are many issues with it, which probably have been fixed in the sequel. It's an okay game for 5 bucks. 

The main issue, or one of the main issues I have with this game, is that you cannot lock onto enemies. I find myself in middle of hoardes constantly and being unable to finish off enemies that are low is really infuriating because the game seems to arbitrarily target random enemies, adjacent to how close they are to you. Sometimes they target the enemies about to swing at you, sometimes the game lunges at an enemy behind every other one. And since there aren't many controls, attempts to do specific actions become difficult because actions like vaulting over an enemy, climbing a wall, as well as dodge rolling take the same button input. 

The second issue I have with this game which is present in similar games is enemies spawning in the moment you look away, you can see enemies spawn in the distance, you can see enemies spawn out of thin air, you can witness enemies clown car spawning from around the corner. 
This is Saints Row the Third levels of being able to watch enemies spawn out of thin air, This is Just Cause 4 levels of enemies spawning and walking out of the walls when there's nowhere they can spawn from. 

You can just run away and climb something and they lose line of sight, but it's ridiculous the sheer amount of enemies that just come out of nowhere to where sometimes you have no breathing room. It's even more ridiculous with the captains, because the game consistently spawns the same ones over and over again. It doesn't matter if you never leave the area where you encounter them, they just seem to show up again.
It's even sillier when the game spawns multiple captains or chiefs or whatever the official term is for them. 

There's no restart mission option, you can only fail it and have to run back to where the mission starts.
It's only ever annoying for missions where you have very niche bonus objectives, but really unfair for stealth missions where the start just has multiple enemies standing next to each other that makes you fail if you engage at all with those enemies as well as having a ring you can't exit or else you fail the mission so you can't despawn and respawn those enemy placements and are just better off manually abandoning the mission and re-engaging it so it has a cleaner start to it. 

It's fun I suppose mindlessly executing uruk after uruk in a never ending splew of enemies, but the re-enforcement mechanic is quite honestly bullshit because some enemies have to run to a horn and others just have one on them at all times. 
I personally like brutalizing enemies and chaining brutalizations because they all run and scatter like ants and I can just freely roam the area as long as I don't get close to uruks that failed to witness brutalizations. 

There's also not much point the the stun combo or killing uruks while you're down because you will never be able to finish those combos while taking on more than one at once. Even the absorb and grab stabs are hard to complete given that even if you aren't the one taking hits it still can cancel you attempt to do so.

The only saving grace this game has is uruks dying the instant there's no ground below them.
Grapping then and tossing them off ledges, pushing them, backing them off a cliff, punching them to falling backwards, etc. However a lot of the time it won't register stuns or pushes and quite honestly is inconsistent in what it takes to manouver a hostage because sometimes it does exactly what I think it would and other times does the exact opposite because you're supposed to hold the hostage opposite to the direction you move, as well as throw the hostage in whatever direction you look rather than move, but the game seems to get confused sometimes. 

The combat is very limited to your sword (hand to hand), bow (long distance), and dagger (stealth). There are environmental things you can engage with but they don't respawn until you leave the area, and if that don't work, advance time, For enemies that have fears you can't capitalize on them half the time because nothing spawned that takes advantage of it."
132,4,0.3669,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Assassin's Creed if every NPC was a guard and hostile at all times. Doing a quest? Have 50 orcs and a Miniboss. Trying to kill a Miniboss? Well better have room for another Miniboss, who brought 50 orcs with him. Wanna go to another area? Good luck sneaking past 3 Minibosses and their 150 orc army. Took a breath the wrong way? Better be ready to kill another 50 orcs for that. 

Story is weird, badly paced and couldn't be further removed from Tolkien's vision. I would be fine with that if it was good. Didn't have the mental endurance for it. Too many orcs. Buy it if you want to do nothing but press X for a couple of hours."

Gollum makes an appearance here. Good voice acting. Unfortunately, it cannot save a boring story for me. Gameplay wise it's the exact same thing over and over again. Defeat mobs of orcs again and again. Rinse and repeat. There's nothing much to do besides that. You kill mobs of orcs in the main mission, you kill mobs of orcs in the side mission. Then you continue to upgrade your equipment and you can mobs of orcs much quicker and better. There's no room to breathe or settlements to wander through just to take in the setting. Nah, just more and more orcs to kill

Game needs better pacing, a climb button and the branding needs to happen with wraith either faster, or give me a ability/ rune to counter people with the alive guy while the elv gets his control on. Ovwerall it falls just shy.

Edit: I jumped back on and simply embraced the way the developers wanted the game to be played and I was correct, watching others play the game for you was simply not fun. The last fight was a QTE.
   I enjoyed what little story there was.
   Making another ing sounds intiresting but if its just going to be a weaker ring of power im not sure if it will be good enough. All well. 

TLDR: Play it, get frustrated that you got 15 min of story in a 30 hour game. Make a little love, get down tonight.
    As a hack and slasher its alright although button prompts on screen do not time well with actual button promt that appears on screen. Many times i countered before the baddies hit me but the counter either didnt register frfom my controller press or there are some frames where you cant cancel out of moves. (Games need to tell us this is this is happening now a days cus if your going to set the timming so tight i need to know how tight the timming is.

If you're into mindless hack-and-slash action, this game is like a virtual stress ball—perfect for a laid-back gaming session. The combat mechanics are smooth, and it's a great way to unwind without taxing your brain too much.

However, don't go in expecting an epic narrative or complex gameplay. This isn't the game for deep thinkers or story enthusiasts. The plot is as straightforward as it gets, and the gameplay lacks the depth that some players crave.

In a nutshell, if you're after a button-mashing, adrenaline-pumping experience and couldn't care less about intricate plots, this might be your jam. But if you're seeking a more well-rounded gaming adventure with substance, you might want to look elsewhere.

I was expecting a deep adventure something like The Witcher or Zelda but it's heavily focused on battling, upgrading over the same looking plain no matter were you are, don't get me wrong the game is pretty at times it's just that it all looks the same somehow with mostly red/brown colours and the same assets used over a vast land.

However despite all of that the hack and slash parts are done very nicely indeed, the animations are really good and some of the upgrades are useful, the actual battles can be satisfying at times.

It's also hilarious to see what wicked creatures you might face next with their stupid ego threats, always makes a kill that bit better, and it's equally interesting if not annoying to see them boast if they kill you only for you to come back and get revenge.

It's not a perfect game but it is different and well worth the 4.99 (not full price) I spent on it, just don't expect a deep adventure/story type game.

There is just not enough here (gets repetitive) to recommend it, buy only in a very steep sale just for the fun parts mentioned above.

Originally gave this game a thumbs up then changed to thumbs down thinking the game would get better later on, but I seen pretty much everything this game had to offer very early on, it's only fun in short bursts and maybe if you want to collect steam achievements."

174,3,0.6424,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Okay, I'm going to be this guy that people will like to hate but let me give me my reason why I can't recommend this game:

This game as a concept: a great idea, executed perfectly, well voice acted, visually appealing.

This game as a story plot connected into the lord of the rings: Terribly executed, lack of character roster (unless you like what feels like the computer generated orc names), Very little magic, Very few variety of monsters, The factions of humans and elves are not as involved as they would be OUTSIDE of the Black Gate - this feels like you got thrown over with the slaves and Sauron is like: Yeah guess you're stuck in here with me - want to play cards?

The game plays out like assassins creed, the collectables are like audio logs (presumingly this is the only reason why you wanted to play the Lord of the Rings game right?) Okay, the nagging feeling why I can't recommend this game:
This just feels like a sandbox where all you do is beat up Orcs
The humans just seem to be slaves and that's it - there's no armies, no elves, no mines with drawfs in: Oh but you'll see some cutscenes that may include some elves to remind you it's a lord of the rings game... but essentially this feels less like a lord of the rings experience and more a lord of the rings holiday camp where the Orcs are just sort of stuck with you here - even if you beat the game. 

The story feels so cookie cut it barely feels like there was a story: the only spoiler I can really say is Oh you want to kill a bad guy because they did bad thing to your family and this other guy wants to help cos their family also experienced this bad thing - like where's the writing, where's the mentioning of the party of heroes defying sauron? Where's that big eye thing? Where's the roster of bad guys that the movies showed? Instead it feels much like a small holiday camp where you are literately having to wail on these Orcs that are suposingly stealing all your Grog and Explosive powder: That's this game, there isn't many stakes, the characters are 2 dimensional and the Universe you've grown to know? Barely existent...

This game had SO MUCH potential: but it feels like they rushed the game's production rather than tell us a story - it's too basic, some people actually thought some guy getting possessed by a wraith was a complicated story line? If you couldn't follow the plot either you weren't paying much attention or you were too distracted with how many Orcs you could throw off a bridge - in all honesty, this game almost got the combat down, but the story was such a let down in writing I can't recommend this game if you are genuinely here for a game that makes you feel like you're fighting sauron's army: all I felt like was I was playing Scott Pilgrim vs the Orcs.

Also can someone explain to me where the ACTUAL Uruk-hai went? Don't tell me the Black Gate has nothing but Orcs because that is not what Sauron's army consists of.

This game I can only recommend if you want something mindless and you don't think too hard about what made the Lord of the Rings Franchise good - the problem with this game is it feels like it wanted to do something with the concept but didn't have the right enough time in the oven: so you ended up with half baked cookie dough: which some of you enjoyed.

It would have been a really good game if they spent more time on the writing and not just slap a bunch of holiday camps for the Orcs for you to go ruin. As a game idea it's fun, as a player playing it after a long time? It's much like a chore list: have you killed the Orcs yet? Have you killed the Orcs while sneaking around? Have you killed the Orcs while jumping down from a ledge? Have you pull the Orcs down from the ledges? Have you used your bow on the Orcs? Your Sword? Your Dagger? Have you scared all the Orcs yet? If this list hasn't tipped you off as to why it isn't fun: I'll let you play the game yourself and maybe after you look past all the voice acting that went into the Orcs themselves you'll realise just how empty of a game this is.

But sure, for those that just want to count how many Orcs they can stab waiting for their friend to come home I suppose that's ""fun"" (shrugs).

I can say it gave me something to do, but is that thing to do an enjoyable experience that I can see myself playing consistently day in day out? Probably not."

In all honesty the game has enjoyable moments and the nemesis system is interesting but i can't help but hate the game more than like it.

The story pacing is absolutely horrible, the first five minutes of this game just give you the feeling like a five year old is hyperactively telling a story with a billion ""and then, this happened and then that happened"" in rapid succession.
The ""tutorial"" or what passes for this is absolutely horrendous, throwing mechanic after mechanic at you and terminology after terminology, giving you 5 seconds to read because you're in the middle of action and said action often keeps on going while appearing on the screen and then assuming you'll remember this mechanic for the rest of the game because you read it once and used it once in the first five minutes.
It also has the same desease a lot of open worlds suffer from, checklist simulator. like ""go to this icon to go do this, then go to that icon to go do this."" If i want to complete a checklist, i'll go grocery shopping, much less faffing about.
Also, why in the blazes did no one bother to balance the sound? if i have to turn music all the way down to 40% just so i can hear more than unintelligeable mumbling for story someone clearly didn't bother to ballance sounds.

Also, the combat in this game is too hard core for me, i can slam the dodge button like a hyperactive squirrel on coffee and stay alive, i can slam my chin into the dodge button and stay alive, i can slam F because finishing off orcs just randomly is a thing and i can even find a rhythm to stay alive while my monitor is turned off because that is how hardcore the combat is. oh my god, never have i seen a combat system that demanded so much attention from me, being a collection of the most forgivable QTE's in the universe to the point you can close your eyes and randomly slam buttons to still stay alive, such a good combat system!
anyone calling this combat system good should get a medical examination, there is no combat system here, only QTE's.

All in all, there is some fun to be found, but the fun also grows stale fast."

The game seems to tell you to kill using executions, because after a few attacks, the enemy will be automatically stunned, yet even after unlocking faster executions, the attack will always be interrupted by the enemy. It's understandable if they want to be realistic, but then again, I should be able to kill enemies with just the normal attacks. Enemies are infinite, so there is no real incentive to fight well, it is better to do hit-and-run type combat. You'll flee a lot and that's a real shame because you need to fight cowardly to thrive in the game."

182,4,0.5974,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Wow, people like this game?

This is the most confusing mess of mechanics I have ever seen. You have the hack 'n' slash combat, archery and stealth to get around and kill enemies, but every time you get to a captain they resist stealth and arrows, so your only chance is to fight them hack 'n' slash style and get swarmed by like 10 enemies and another captains appears and another captain appears and another captain appears. Now you have to fight 4 captains and a horde of orcs. Some of the captains have poison spears so you have to get rid of them first, but theres also shield orcs that can only be defeated by getting behind them and hitting them in the back, but then you get hit from all sides... honestly it's a fucking mess. Having a stealth game without any rpg mechanics where you can tactically take out enemies (including the captains) in stealth and only having to rely on direct fights if you get caught would be much better.

The much praised nemesis system is also kinda shit tbh. In Crackdown you could take down generals and slowly weaken the faction bosses to increase your chances with him. If you were good at the game, you could just go to the bosses directly and beat the game in less than an hour. The nemesis system only exists to constantly swarm you with more captains.

All of these mechanics only exist to artificially stretch the playtime, if the mechanics were consistent, the game would be a lot better and a lot shorter. As it stands I fucking hate this and don't get the hype at all.

Main bossfights are far too easy, some captains are ridiculously hard (encountered one who could only be damaged by fire, but he patrolled in an area with few grogs, cool encounter). The outcast missions are stupidly boring, literally the same thing 24 times with a slightly different bonus objective. Does a good job at putting a lot of LotR lore into a game.

You just can't hype up Sauron as a final boss and have him then die in a set of 5 quicktime events. It really sours the entire game that every orc you fight in the entire game is harder than fucking Sauron."
197,4,0.6013,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","I'm only about 3 hours in, but I don't really get it. The concept is you are supposed to tear through a bunch of orc captains, progressively killing high and higher ranked ones until you have slain or control most of the orc army. Then you can confront Sauron who killed you and your bound wraith's families. 

I would say the characters are very nondescript. They're kind of blank slates and caricatures. Which isn't a bad thing, it's just not a good point either. Very neutral. 
The environments look really good!

The gameplay and mechanics are what ruin it for me, or more so the inconsistencies within them. Let me recount for you nearly all my gameplay experience since getting out of the tutorial levels. 

So you get out of the tutorials feeling like a total badass, right? SoM has a similar combat system to the Batman: Arkham series where you'll be surrounded by orcs, but because of forgiving counter and dodge mechanics you can take on a dozen at a time and hardly get hurt. So I go out to start killing some lower leveled captains. The first one in the story goes swimmingly. 

Okay, seems like it's time to go onto the next one. I mark it on my map and start heading that way when I run into a Caragor, basically a Mordor terror hound, and it absolutely mops the floor with me, but not even in a fair ""Oh I'm underleveled to fight this enemy way."" They have a dodge mechanic which is just buggy and terrible. They'll leap at you and time slows, you see a big ""Press SPACE to dodge"" prompt come up on screen, and like 50% of the time it just doesn't work and you get two shot by these things. So after dying to these things in the wild several times because I have to travel quite a ways across the map to my destination, I'm able to sneak by them all and get there. 

The game wants to introduce weaknesses, so this orc captain is terrified of Caragors. You are then able to ride one and literally one shot him. It just seemed a little too swingy where it's like any challenge at all is just completely ignored if you figure out a weakness? 

Anyways, I continue to seek out yet another captain whose name I don't remember, but they're all just two gross words smashed together, so I'll call him Rotgore. This quest goes fine and I kill him. On my way to my next target, I happen to run into Rotgore, who I'd slain literally like 2 minutes ago. I defeat him again, but this time he flees and there's nothing you can do about it. He just runs off into the distance and disappears. I finish off the chumps and basically turn around and there is... Rotgore! ""YOU BLOTCHY SCUM HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST OF ROTGORE!"" he exclaims, or something like that as if he hadn't just booked it into the woods at at most a minute ago. This time we fight to the death and he is slain for a second time. Making my way to my next quest, it takes like 5 minutes this time but I run into another captain by the name of, you guessed it, Rotgore. We fight and he flees for a second time. 

I finally get to my destination to start the quest hunting the orc captain I'd actually like to target. The quest begins with you lying in wait in a ruin as this high ranking orc captain passes through with his personal guard. Secondary objective appears to stealth kill the 5 guards marching in an arrowhead formation before the captain notices. I comically backstab the guards standing 5 feet from each other from back to front because apparently they have a 30 degree field of vision and no sense of hearing. Nice, so it's gonna be a 1v1 in this desolate area with just me and this big boss guy! *Trump* ""Wrong."" I backstab the captain with no one else around, the battle initiates, and within 15 seconds THREE MORE captains show up with their entourages including, you guessed it, Rotgore. 

Why is any of this happening!? The orcs I kill apparently don't stay dead. Any scenario I set up in order to get an edge in a hard battle doesn't matter (unless it's from a designated weakness, in which case you'll auto win the fight instead). The difficulty flies from way too easy to way too hard with no warning. It's just that I have no idea what to expect at any time because there are so many inconsistencies."

I'll admit I'm a late-adopter; I never played it until just recently, but this is 100% a game of its time. Combat feels pretty flat; it's your run-of-the-mill dodge/parry system, where enemies telegraph their intent with a giant icon above their heads, because it's a lot easier to develop that than it is to carefully craft the animations and game play to the point where you as a player don't need that kind of assistance. Attacks feel random; I found myself suddenly sliding great distances at enemies I wasn't intending to attack, performing acrobatic antics that might look cool enough, but it all made my inputs feel extremely disconnected from what was happening on-screen.

This is all made worse by the fact that you can't actually see anything. As a 3rd-person game, your character is ENORMOUS, taking up half the screen.

237,3,0.8559,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","The thing to understand here is that Warner Brothers really just has 3 games that they make over and over: Arkham Asylum, Mortal Kombat, and Lego Whatever. Some of them have different titles, but pretty much all are some variant of one of these. Shadow of Mordor is an Arkham Asylum clone, and not a particularly compelling one. 

What I'll say in its favor is that the character models do look very good, and their movements are choreographed in a way that adds plenty of excitement. If you want a mindless hack-and-slash to rock out to (which I do at times, tbh), you could do a lot worse. I think what the game is best at is recreating the aesthetic of the Peter Jackson movies; honestly I think my favorite thing about it is how it inspired me to rewatch those.

Now the negatives: Shadow of Mordor really doesn't take very long at all to get repetitive. I assumed that if I played through the story enough then it would stop feeling so grind-heavy at some point, but it never did. With the mechanics being so rote, I also hoped that the story would offer something for Tolkien nerds, but I didn't really get that either. This is the thing with making games by the book: I already have Arkham Asylum and Mad Max in my library, and the simple fact that I've played those strips away the possibility of this game having any novelty. Without anything extra to hold my interest, it becomes way too forgettable for the amount of work that went into making it.

Basically the game is bubble gum: kinda fun, but loses flavor fast."
238,3,0.5826,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This is pretty much one of the most boring games I've ever played. Maybe I should've just speedrun the story because I tried to finish side quests instead and they literally drained my want to finish this game at all and yes I couldn't bring myself to finish the game.

Combat is nice since it is inspired from Batman: Arkham series - I'm saying inspired but it is copied down to the keyboard scheme - and Nemesis system is well-thought but they fail to carry the game as missions get more boring and tedious as the game ""progress""es. Don't push yourself to fill the whole chain of command with your henchmen though. Because midway through to story, as you progress to the second map, you will get a whole new chain of command to influence again. 

Side missions are basically ""shoot this much birds"", ""hunt this much graugs"", ""rescue these men under bla-bla minutes"", ""take 10 orcs down without being seen"" and looking for drawings and shiny things around the map on top of these. Completing these missions get you experience points and stuff but from where I stopped playing - I was nearing the main story's end though - you definitely won't need to unlock all of the abilities.,

Main story has pretty much nothing to it. Every single character feels like a filler. They put even Gollum in two missions(to appeal to movie fans of course) but his part doesn't even conclude at all. He just disappears after these missions and I have literally nothing else to comment on because story just didn't interest me at all.

Open world is just four walls that are put in place because there needs to be one. It is blank and lifeless. Orcs spawn in fixed points, zones and follow fixed paths. You could memorize their places in a few hours(or you can just toggle Detective Vision, yes the game has detective vision). First map is basically a desert. Second map is a desert with green color plate that is littered with tigers and giants and even more orcs. They are basically the bare minimum.

I didn't play the sequel yet so I have no idea if they improved any of this yet but you could spend your time on better things."

The story moved at a fairly steady and consistent pace at the start and throughout most of the game, but it felt rushed towards the end much like the 2 bosses. Each of the 2 bosses mainly consisted of lack-lustre time events and a very easy and quite laughable rogue like combat with almost no skill involved.

249,3,0.6175,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Shadow of Mordor starts out strong with its ""nemesis system"" that lets you infiltrate and disrupt the ranks of Sauron's army in a variety of ways. Combat is smooth and fast paced with satisfyingly lethal abilities and finishers to employ. Gameplay continues to feel fresh and exciting as you tier up to take on bigger groups of enemies and work your way up the ranks, culminating in some epic war chief encounters. This is where things unfortunately start to plateau. 

The second region offers very little that you haven't already experienced. You will max out your skill tree just as combat begins to get stale. The appeal of taking on hordes of enemies  wanes as captains become increasingly immune to multiple forms of attack, forcing you into tediously drawn-out encounters. The numerous rescue missions involve killing orcs under prescribed bonus conditions to release slaves, who then tell you to rescue more slaves by killing more orcs. Meanwhile, finishing the quest lines for each of your weapons rewards you with lore but disappointingly no new combat abilities. The additions of branding and mounted combat don't diversify things enough to justify wanting to subjugate another entire region. 

At this point the story needs to start carrying more weight but the premise shines brighter than the story itself. The dynamic between Talion and Celebrimbor is interesting, but the plot is a straight-forward quest for revenge with a few one-dimensional side characters and surprisingly unmemorable boss encounters. Collectible artifacts offer some interesting tidbits of lore while collecting ithildin bewilderingly leads to nothing lore-related at all. 

Then there's the Bright Lord DLC where you are in possession of The One Ring and eager to unleash its power in a well earned and cathartic final act. But it turns out pre-wraith Celebrimbor is quite weak with less hp, no ranged focus, and none of the improved combat perks that you enjoyed as Talion. Using the ring gives you a few precious seconds to even the playing field, but filling the meter again is a dull chore. War chiefs and their guard captains are oppressively resilient while side missions send you scrambling to hold back multiple fronts of orcs that somehow manage to quickly destroy your stone towers with swords and spears. 

Shadow of Mordor relies too heavily on its combat to carry it as far as it tries to go. If they had invested more into the story and characters and consolidated progression into one of the two regions I think it would have been better. Despite the hours I put in to get as much out of the experience as I could there are too few positive elements spanning only half of the duration for me to be able to really recommend this game."
250,3,0.6908,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I was really torn about whether or not to recommend this game. I had fun with the game and don't exactly regret my time playing, but if I could go back, I would only have bought this one and not the shadow bundle, even on sale, because I can't see myself ever playing Shadow of War.

I played on Steam Deck, and it ran pretty well.

The good:

-The nemesis system was pretty cool. Sucks that it got patented, because I think it could have had even better execution than it did, but whatever.

-Loved the voice acting for the orcs and that one dwarf guy.

-The wraith powers were cool, though it was unfortunate that they came into their own so late in the game. Their interactions with the orcs (as pertinent to late-game story) was incredibly satisfying.

-I liked actually hunting down specific orc leaders. Scouting them out, discovering strengths and weaknesses, and doing clever tricks to take them down was a blast.

-Really dug the optional artifacts. Those were a nice touch.

The take-it-or-leave-it:

-Sound design was meh. Music was entirely mediocre.

-The rune system felt... kind of like an afterthought? Runes barely affected my playstyle at all.

-Side quests were serviceable, I guess. I rarely felt any strong desire to do them, but I personally am difficult to please with side quests.

-The power system made no sense, but that didn't really bother me.

The bad:

-Hate to say it, but the actual combat flow didn't really do it for me. I absolutely loved it in the Arkham games, but it felt pretty stripped down in this one by comparison. It served its purpose, and I didn't hate it, but every regular orc I dispatched seemed like an annoying obstacle to the enemy I was actually trying to take out. Add to it the general lack of reward for consistent crits (other than more finishers, which felt more necessary than good,) and lackluster takedown/distraction options in stealth before combat, and I felt like maybe I should just play more Batman instead.

-Good heavens, Talion was such a flavorless character. Don't give me some crap about how he's ""stoic"" or ""acting like a true man"" or whatever, the dude is an edgelord who runs out of emotions immediately after the prologue. I don't want ""stoic tough guy who just kind of exists to destroy everyone,"" I want a guy who we can actually believe wants revenge. I want a guy who grapples with the ethics of working with the Brightlord.  I want something to remember him by. All I have is his stupid out-of-nowhere deal at the end of the game, otherwise, he's just a vehicle for a ghost, who feels like the actual main character, when he really should not be.

-Speaking of story, this game was all over the place. The decision to have story furthered at random times by random missions hurt a story that was already most interesting when it wasn't about the main character. Add to the fact that Talion was in conflict with basically nobody except the game-generated nemeses that popped up, and there was absolutely no real drive to distract me from the next point.

-Stealth and world exploration could have been made so much more interesting than they were. Herb and monster quests existed for no real reason, and while the powers of enemy distraction were cool, they were made sad by the over-reliance on the bow and elfshot. It made little sense and was slightly immersion-breaking.

Verdict:

While I really did enjoy this game, despite my major gripes with it, I could not get over the repetitive gameplay loop: shoot, stab, and enslave lesser orcs until you can get to the leader, then play a button mash rhythm game that relies too much on the player absolutely nailing it. The story was irredeemably average, and while I think the nemesis system is genius, the things I took issue with were the main focus of the game. I can enjoy the wraith stuff all I want, but this game, much like Talion, lacks the flavor to make the game stand out."

If you get this game, don’t expect to finish it cause it honestly got boring, especially since the story is basically surface level LotR themed filler.

+Tight combat controls

+Accurate depiction of Mordor (dark, bleak, hopeless)

+Story is compelling

+Many side quests / spontaneous in world events to complete

+Can ride Caragors which is cool

CONS
-Game is too hard with no way to lower ingame difficulty.

-Unblockable enemy attacks have too short a window in which to react (I see the prompt and press the dodge button but the attack still lands).

-The Nemisis system is too punishing - dying a handful of times makes enemy captains unkillable.

-When a fight starts, enemies swarm to your location from half-way across the map. So if you want to practice combat by fighting 2-3 enemies, soon you are swarmed with 10+ enemies and a difficult captain.

-When trying to retreat, enemies chase for too long

265,3,0.5727,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Let me preface this by saying that I loved this game back in the day on the Xbox 360. Played the crud out of it. At the time, it felt new and exciting, though you could definitely see the inspiration that the devs took from the Arkham series. Today, however, the game feels different to me. In light of newer games, harnessing current hardware and development practices of course, this game feels so-- one dimensional.

I'll start with the combat since it's the most compelling part of the game. While it's basically just the combat from the Arkham series, it feels as though it's been watered down and stripped straight down to the basics. Strikes feel like they don't hit very hard, attacks feel as though they take far too long to land, the rhythm doesn't feel like it flows as well as the Arkham games, and the enemy variety is wildly small. Speaking of rhythm, the character movement feels weighty, but not a good weighty like in GTA or Assassin's Creed, but rather, it feels like you're trying to control a 10-ton bowling ball as it rolls around a massive vat of molasses. This makes combat flow wildly inconsistent, and the traversal an absolute chore, especially when climbing.

The world is the worst part of this game. I'm no game-dev, but I could sit my 2 year old nephew in front of a computer with a game engine loaded up, and he could create a more believable world than what you see in Shadow of Mordor. The entire map is one massive, flat valley, filled randomly with decorations that were placed out of compulsion rather than necessity. It doesn't feel natural, but rather, it feels stale and artificial, like the devs told an AI to randomly place objects in a blank world. I understand that this game is old, but there were far more believable worlds being released at the time when this game came out. The nostalgic gamer in me wants me to say that this game is just a product of its time, but honestly, I felt the same way about the game world back then.

Finally, the story is-- inconsequential. It feels like nothing you do matters, and you never feel anything for the characters, save Talion. When I save a group of slaves, I don't care, because it doesn't feel like I actually made a difference. When I complete a mission, I often finish the cutscene and immediately forget what I just did. And when I kill a group of enemies, nothing happens, other than stacking up a massive pile of bodies. The collectibles, lore entries, databank entries, none of it is compelling or interesting, and when the story doesn't stand on its own, it must rely on the gameplay, and unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't stand on its own either.

Believe me, if there's anyone out there that feels nostalgia for this game, it's me. But it definitely shows signs of its age. If you're a fan of LoTR, then get this on sale, but I'd honestly just steer clear and play the Arkham series if you're looking for something that does everything this game does, only better."

It is basically an Assassin's Creed ripoff in Middle-Earth.  It's not a terrible game.  The gameplay is fun at some times and boring at others.  The graphics and cinematics are decent.  Yes, the game is old at this point, but I haven't played a bunch of games of this style, so I'm not disappointed due to it being an older game.  It just isn't particularly compelling.  The characters don't make me feel any attachment to them.  The open-world nature of the game is fairly pointless since there isn't enough meaningful content to make you feel like you are actually making choices.  You are just following the story.  And the story isn't really bad, but the story and characters just aren't that compelling.  If another character connected to the main character dies, it doesn't feel meaningful the way it should in an immersive game.  Good voice acting most of the time, although the voice acting of the orcs feels a bit off.  Can't see myself ever putting more than the ~20 hours that I spent finishing the main story.  There are other modes, but after finishing the main story I don't feel much desire to explore them.

Overall, it's not a bad game, but the recommendations on here are heavily in favor of it.  I think the game is pretty average, thus the negative review relative to what everyone else seems to have given."

The story's alright, though.

In addition, just like the Arkham games - there's just way too many controls layered on top of each other so every accidental ""fat-finger"" of a control can throw off your combo and general flow of combat that feels kinda cheap and makes most combat feel unrewarding (i.e., Batman's multiple-gadget system is a good example), which really demonstrates that this game was built with a PS/XBOX controller in mind.

On the topic of combat, the mini-bosses (i.e., Orc Captains) were a really cool idea, but when there is an INFINITE supply of them, they just kinda stop being interesting and blend into the crowd of all the other hordes of orcs you had to put down - and that goes double for their loot drops, which are just more weapon runes that you don't need and convert to XP.

Just kinda my gripe with this game and why I honestly cannot recommend it at this stage, because I'm bored of it already."

The gameplay is not bad, I can see why it appeals to so many people, but it also didn't really pull me in that much. There's a lot of game design decisions that I disagree with, most importantly a lot of game features make the later game easier and easier. So you start at rather high difficulty, not knowing the game and not having various powers, then it gets so easy it's boring.

A special note I would make as a dad is that the game has a lot of meaningless brutality on every step. You are not a good guy. I'm used to murder people in games, but here it was very graphic, including basically torturing people, with explicit racism (of a kind ""orcs are not human, so doing this is totally ok""). The game's story seems like it would like to touch this subject, but is afraid to really go into it too much.

And the story is a very weak point of the game. By the end I was skipping the cutscenes. It was terribly boring, didn't make much sense neither on its own nor in Tolkien's world.

""Hey, lets bring out a new game a lot of people like - but dont invest to much to make lots of profit - anyone an idea?""
""Year, just take the mechanics from Assassins Creed, mix it with TLotR - done!""
""Good plan, dont forget to build in a lot of collector missions to lengthening the game time!""

I guess this was the dialogue when Shadow of Mordor was born.
The game seems to have nearly the same mechanics like Assassins Creed, but way worse implemented. At the end of the game, there are so many different functions of the same keys, that it is more luck than knowledge, which action the hero will take. Also combat mechanics like jumping over enemies, rolling over etc. are badly implemented - being to near to an enemy and rolling over resulting and jumping on them for example.
Also, the missions which have nothing to to with the main story getting boring after the 3rd, at least after the 10th one - collect 30 of this, collect 40 of that item - which only give you some XP but it is not conclusive, how they contribute to the game and story.
Also the ""Boss"" fights are just the same as standard fights against warchiefs and captains, they only differ in the health bar.
Using the terrain is sometimes also bad implemented (e.g. climbing on a building sometimes results in weired jumps) as well as some quest mechanics: ""Kill Orcs while hidden"" -> stealth killing an orc -> Quest failed with no reason, not even a hint, WHO as spottet you.
At last, developers seems to like cutscenes very much. There are a lot of then and often repetitive (e.g. warchief appears) and also, if you fail a quest and restart, you have to watch the whole cutscene from the queststart again. And again. And again...

What I enjoied at last was the main story around the ""Shadow"" and his alter ego - but thats it. I would not recommend to play this as an ""alternative"" to AC nor getting a lot of new insights into the LotR lore."
319,4,0.5478,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Torn on this review because a good friend of mine gifted this to me. 

While the game started out fun, the latter half of the game greatly restricts the player from freedom of play. For example, many of the captains and warchiefs are immune to certain strategies, such as stealth attacks or combo finishers. What ends up happening is that the game leaves you with only one or two methods of killing the ""boss,"" greatly limiting your approach. Essentially, the game forces you to play in a certain way, and limits your freedom to choose. Wanna stealth the boss? Nope. Wanna execute a combo finisher on the boss? Nope. Sorry, his only weakness is fire. So now, a game that is supposed to be stealth focused now restricts you from using stealth. The devs forcing the player to kill captains and warchiefs in restrictive ways made the end game feel more like a chore. 

Apart from the tedious gameplay mechanics, the open world was quite bland and did not have much to offer in terms of exploration. Compared to other ""open world"" games, Shadow of Mordor has probably one of the weakest designs. The story was also lackluster (typical revenge story), and characters such as Torvind the Dwarf were extremely cliche' and annoying to listen to. I ended up skipping through most of the dialogue where Torivnd spoke. As a LoTR fan, this game did not live up to the name. 

Some games with similar mechanics but better execution are the Arkham games and Mad Max."
320,4,0.6867,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","The problem with this game is that they can't figure out what they want. On the one hand, it's open world. You can run around all you want. Orcs will attack you constantly, but you can run from them if you're not in the mood for fighting.

However, the 'missions' will require you to go to a specific point and press a button. This janks you out of the open world immediately. You were in the middle of fighting 20 orcs, but suddenly there's a cutscene playing and they are all gone. When you beat the mission, you're immediately dumped back into the world as it is when you finish it. So you're trying to collect loot, but 20 orcs are attacking you.

The game also has a tendency to constantly send swarms of orcs to attack you, while you have basically no area of effect attacks. You can execute them, but you never have enough time to do it as you'll be attacked by another orc instantly.

The Nemesis system is pretty cool, but it doesn't feel like you're making progress, because new orc captians get created all the time, which keeps the screen filled with enemies. Furthermore, the increased power when an enemy kills you gives the impression the boss will be harder to beat if you repeat the fight, which is a terrible experience.

Bosses can also attack you at any time, including during a different boss fight. It's incredibly frustrating to find a strategy to kill one boss only to be randomly attacked by two other bosses during your fight.

There's also no difficulty options, which is pretty crazy for a game like this. I get there's a nemesis system, but still, you should be able to adjust difficulty."

Nope, there IS no later. There is only now. Dead. Now again. Dead. He gets more and more powerful, and I can't avoid him. Dead. Again and again. Dead. No matter WHAT I'm doing, he's there. Dead.

I'm sick of it. I can't strategize. The game won't LET me even TRY to deal with this guy on my terms. It has determined that I WILL deal with him again and again until I die again and again. I can't let myself get down in health AT ALL, no matter what I'm doing, because he IS going to show up out of NOWHERE, which means that I can't ""git gud"" because I'm not ALLOWED to fight other things or do other missions without him showing up to finish me off at the worst possible moment.

RIDICULOUS!

This is yet another game that has great promise but then utterly fails in its painful execution.

I'm rage-quitting this one. There are better games to play that don't FORCE me to do what I DON'T want in every sense and every context."

341,3,0.6877,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I don't want this to seem like Im hating so I will try to update it as I play, I simply wish to convey that this does not feel like Lord of the Rings, or Middle-Earth or even fantasy, at all from the get-go. The first thing I noticed was the UI, it looks bland and sci-fi-esque, which is okay if you-re playing a sci-fi-fantasy blend. A sci-fi aesthetic, however, is something - in my opinion - that ought to be kept far away from anything High Fantasy in every respect. It's not appealing to look at and is far removed from what a fantasy map would look like. It's all function and no form and just...I don't even want to look at it, it hurts the eyes and my sense of aesthetics. 

As a story-oriented person, the first opening moments are absolutely key to maintaining interest, which is something I think fails to do.

Right off the bat, the story does not capture my interest or make a compelling case as to why I should care about any of the characters. I can understand why Talion himself would want this and do what he does, but I am not Talion and I don't feel as he does.
 
Unfortunately, words do not make stories, characters and plot; feelings do. Words are supposed to sort of be an inner monologue in a way. Inner thoughts create emotions and by extension justifies their actions. Rationally it ticks all the boxes as to why Talion will do what he does, but I do not feel it and that is what kills it for me.
The struggle is purely in the writing and I do not feel the struggle with him. The crux of my entire review is there is no relationship between the characters and the player. When they struggle, we are supposed to feel it. When they are sad, so should we, when they are happy, so are we. I personally felt no different about Talion from the start of the game to the end of the first mission, and I felt nothing throughout it all. 

What happens to Talion is sad, yes. But it did not feel like the reaction I would have if the same happened to me. Likewise I could not make that reaction unless I had a memory of said character that attached me to them that would make me sad enough to care about what happened. Aligning thoughts and emotions between the protagonist and the player is somewhat important if this is a personal-journey kind of game, which it is.

Let's talk about those next. Now this is spoiler territory. 

Banished from death? Firstly, why is this the reason we fight? Why is this a bad thing? A more compelling reason would be revenge but...I mean, of all the things, wanting to die is the least compelling reason. It's a good premise for a comedy, killing your way to the guy so you can kill him so you can die, but this is a game about something serious and I just cant believe this is our motivation. It's sounds like something Deadpool would do.

I'll keep playing but this I can't play this and not try to reolplay as deadpool to make this whole thing make sense lol. Im sure there is more to it but honestly this is my first impression and it's not a good one."

Basically Assassin's Creed meets Batman in a LOTR settings.

Not being a LOTR fan, I wasn't really interested in what was happening story wise and the gameplay wasn't enough to keep me interested past the first region. It's very easy and repetitive. The player progressively gets more and more OP while the challenge doesn't ramp up accordingly.

Graphics look stunning especially with the free HD Texture Pack despite being a game released in 2014.

There's not much more to say about this, it's overall a very average game best suited to casual gamers or LOTR fans.

You get the brawling experience from Arkham (but, with far less options, e.g.: no hook to lift you onto nearby buildings, no proximity mines, no freezing/stun, no underground passageways to grab unaware enemies, etc.), and quests much like Far Cry (i.e. you need to reach a location to start the quest from there). Character progression is limited to a few bonuses and moves here and there. Customization is extremely limited, basically you can choose some runes to add to your weapons, which add some small bonuses or powers.

The story is quite boring and unimaginative. The game itself is funny for a couple of hours, then it starts to become extremely repetitive. The whole world building is, too, very repetitive. Monsters are (guess what?) also repetitive as you basically keep killing hordes of orcs, some beast-like thingies and occasionally, tougher orcs (""captains""). So if you like doing the very same thing again and again (some people actually find it relaxing or even entertaining) or if you totally love the LotR setting, then give it a try, Otherwise just get Batman Arkham (any game in the Arkham trilogy is better than this one, imho) and enjoy much richer story, gameplay, challenge and visuals."

  Some of the weaknesses and strengths for the captains and warchiefs are also ridiculous, after easily gaining this intel from other orcs (or u find some random paper laying around) u can then abuse them. Quite a few times during my playthrough i had important orcs in main storyline missions with a weaknesses that just lets them get steamrolled i.e. will get killed in one head shot or instantly die from a stealth attack etc. This made the game feel like even more of a boring cakewalk as all it took to finish these quests was to crouch walk to a building and use it to either stealth attack from above or just snipe em. 

Also every fort u go to has like a billion interactable Caragor cages, fly nests, and explosives for you to trigger that are capable of killing or routing a ton of enemies(including captains/warchiefs). this leads me to talk about how OP brutalizing is. By mid game u have 4 options in stealth mode; stealth kill, brand, drain(pointless imo) and brutalize(the best). Brutalizing an orc looks cool and makes the game 10x easier as it scares off nearby orcs and sometimes even captains. If landed in a moshpit of orcs during one of ur countless ""kill warchief"" missions you can delete handfuls of uruk by just killing 1, rinse and repeat. lame. this game is a 3.5/10 that offers so little, world doesn't feel alive, mid combat system and progression system, 90% of the main story missions are the same mission and those that are different fail to impress.

388,3,0.8382,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Very light spoiler warning! Will mention the prologue (first 10 mins of the game) So if this is a issue please don't read further :) 

So as a fan of LOTR, playing the classics and thoroughly enjoying them I expected to really enjoy this game but as of the time of writing ( 11 hours in ) I'm ready to set this game down to potentially revisit it in the future. 

I neither enjoyed or disliked my experience so far and I'll give some pros and cons after this! 
The breaking point for me.. was after 11 hours I realised i didn't even know the main characters name.. They have told me, But they did not make me care enough to even remember their name. 

The prologue is a very important part of any RPG.. It is there for setting the story and to get you attached to the characters and care about them, to make you want to play through the story and see how it concludes.
Shadow of Mordor fails to utilize this.. The prologue Is far too short.. around 10 minutes.. at the end of it orks kill your wife and son before the game gives you a chance to like or care for them. 
You are then thrown into a predictable revenge story with very little depth. 
Given how big the LOTR world is and how much lore they can toy with there is extremely little depth.. no twists and turns, extremely predictable and generic. 

I have reached a part of the game where I must do side missions to attain power to kill warchiefs ( Or maybe I'm just trash and should be able to kill them... ) Regardless The side missions are extremely predictable and repetitive even more so than the main game. I do not care enough to want to see the story through due to little character and plot building to bother doing so. 

Pros: 

The nemesis system 10/10 - This concept is fantastic and I'd love to see more games implement something similar! The system showcases a Intricate web of orcs all with unique strengths, weaknesses, combat style and dialogue! Any NPC that kills you in battle will attain a rank of captain in which makes it a "" Boss "" which can progress through the ork ranks with interactions between one another.

Combat 7/10 - Pretty generic combat that utilises different weapons and approaches. You can engage in combat via melee, ranged, stealth.. causing explosions.. yada yada Very akin to the mid/late assassin creed entries. If you have played these you will feel at home in this game. 

Cons: 

Repetition - The game feels repetitive after a mere 2-3 hours in.. Failing to apply many new mechanics or mission variety past this point. This Is relatively standard for games like this ( Assassin creed does this ) But other games in the genre do something better that i will be listing as the next con to make this feel lesser or negligible. 

Story - With such a large world and very deep lore to take advantage of this game from my current play time does not do so. Where other games that are similar in size and play style excel this game severely lacks.
There was so little prologue and story setting/character development that as I pointed out earlier I do not even know the main characters name after 11 hours play.. nor do i care to know. I know nothing of his background or why his doing what his doing ( outside of a generic revenge story after the death of his wife and son that the game failed to make me care for ). The main missions even at this early point feel extremely predictable and repetitive and even as a fan of the franchise i do not care to see it through. 

I will revisit this later to see if any depth is added and it makes me grow to care about "" the main dude whose name i don't know "" but after 11 hours I have no motivation to play anymore.. I lost motivation after about 4 hours but wanted to give it a fair shot and i feel 11 hours is plenty a fair shot. 

After playing JRPGs I know some games have a slow start.. This just feels too shallow.

I'm not a fan of the combat, it seems really repetitive and its almost like there's no end to the button mashing. But the worst thing about this game that turns me off massively is the controls, this is possibly one of the worst controller layouts I have ever come across. I may be in the minority here but the game is just unplayable and not enjoyable, constantly sheathing your sword when trying to execute someone then getting hit from behind makes me want to put my head through the wall. The constant stuttering whilst Talion decides whether to run or not is infuriating. 
On a positive note, the cut scenes are amazing and the world looks great. 

Unfortunately this will have to be uninstalled and put back in the library forever to be faded out.

393,4,0.4229,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Overall, there is a lot to like about Shadow of Mordor, but if I have to give a final verdict, the clunky controls (using the same keys for very different functions- dropping off a ledge and attacking an enemy- are extremely frustrating when getting ganked by 20+ enemies at once and the best way to thin the opposition is standing on a roof above them - but you keep climbing off the side and hanging from the ledge instead of dealing damage)... The constant brutal murdering and control of orcs also seems at odds with Tolkien's overall vision which is quite jarring (especially when kills can be really brutal). I had also expected a lot more RPG elements, rather than constant murder of orcs to rank up weapons/ skills... The constant interruptions during battle by orc captains was also frustrating. You get into a battle when the fight pauses and a captain gives a monologue and there's a heap of slow mo. Then the game suddenly throws you right back into the battle (when you may have just about been able to dodge an imminent attack but you miss the cue because of the cutscene)...
Having said that, the combat is usually quite fun. The story is interesting and the game expends on the world behind the black gate. The graphics are great and the skills you can unlock are quite interesting to use as well.

So when fighting a larger horde, like in said mission, you can just hack away endlessly until you are overwhelmed. Not to say that random captains can join in the fight, making you fight not only one, but sometimes 2 or 3 captains at the same time.

[h1]Further info[/h1]

The Game is wonderful for LOTR fans+non-fans! I will be playing this before the sequel (Shadow of War) just for the sake of knowing the story. I've been told the sequel is a direct continuation to this!

ORC EDIT:

However, the cons, even if they are FAR LESS than the pros, they just outweigh them. I'll be updating this to a negative review. See you in Shadow of War.

[b]Pros[/b]

- Graphics hold up regardless of the older release dates (There's an HD upgrade DLC, free)
- Nemesis system (Like assassination contracts) is amazing, can have infinite game-play just with it!
- RPG elements is really nice. Weapon upgrades (Sword, Bow, Dagger) and Skill upgrades as well.
- Leveling is so smooth. You kill Orc Captains/War-chiefs for Power, and you do missions for Power, you can XX power and level from that. 
- True LOTR ambiance. Orcs everywhere chasing slaves, fires, ghouls, monsters, buildings, castles, etc... and there's a lot of things to do on every section of the map
- Stealth. Stealth. Stealth.
- Satisfying combat with slow-motion attacks, special effects like fire on sward, exploding ground etc..
- Parkour (Like Assassin's Creed actually) and also parkour with combat, you can fucking flip over enemies and kick them!
- Story is amazing. So far I'm half way through but its very capturing and intriguing.
- SMEEEEEEGGGOOOLLLL! MY PRECIOUS!!!! Yes, you meet him.
- Pretty great performance+bench-marking. I don't have any FPS drops or lags, whatsoever, but again, I have a beefy PC that can handle anything on Ultra.
- Awesome cut-scenes, feels like you're actually watching a movie sometimes.

[b]Cons[/b]

- The game, after just a few hours, becomes SO repetitve and boring to play. All you will be doing is running/fast traveling from a place to another, scan some artifacts, kill same orcs, listen to them being edgy and cringy when they see you, pressing space when you drop from cliffs and saving slaves. That's all. Story missions are also very similar, kill this dude, blow up this camp, kill orcs, etc....
- So far, my only complain is about the controls. I don't care what others say, yes, you get used to it.. but the controls are atrocious! Camera movement is so crappy...
- Menu buttons seem to have some kind of delay sometimes? Maybe input delay idk.. e.g. clicking enter/ESC sometimes doesn't work and I need to click twice for it to go away.

[h1]Mandatory QoL add-ons[/h1]

FOV Fix (because it makes me sick...)

- Download this: https://www.flawlesswidescreen.org/ and add the game's add-on, this will fix the very-close FOV that you cannot actually modify."
402,3,0.6919,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Very repetitive and very grindy.
the combat is lackluster at best as it feels you are beating things to death with a bat not slicing them with a sword and upgrades are pretty pricey for what you get too"
403,4,0.4597,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Simply put, this game is clunky, finnicky, and most of the time downright annoying. 

Let me explain: First, I was getting Talian stuck on EVERYTHING. Second, constantly searching for arrows eventually almost forced my fist through my computer screen. Third, my Uruk companions accidentally murdered one of the warchiefs that I needed, forcing me into this three hour loop of screaming at my computer screen. Overall, I had THE HARDEST time controlling Talian. He would jump in wrong directions, grab the wrong ledges, get stuck on random branches and trees. All of this while trying to fend off UNENDING waves of orcs. I wouldn't have such a huge problem with this if I need my skills would be rewarded, but they never are. The fights are just neverending and honestly quite exhausting. I was drained by the end of it. 

And this for me also extends to the open world in general. The design is TERRIBLE. They are linear pathways, not really open. But mostly, getting from mission to mission relied on me doing this stupid spring quick time event to build up my sprint speed in hopes to not get caught in the wild by hundreds of orcs. Yes, there were times when I just wanted to explore and go pick up collectibles, but you can't. The orcs are EVERYWHERE and agro on you CONSTANTLY. It's EXHAUSTING and it never lets up. I felt like there was no breathing room, especially when most of the fights involved 20-30-40 enemies at a time. It's just a constant swing-and-hope-Talian-listens-to-your-command-this-time crap fest.

In the end, the story holds this game up for sure. But the gameplay absolutely has not aged well AT ALL. I've gone back and played many of the old Assassin's Creed games and they've aged better than this. I'm onto Shadow of War next. I prey that they fixed some of this stuff because the gameplay is just not for me. Spiderman, Arkham, Ass Creed are all better versions of this. This is the worst version of this style of combat loop. 

PS I almost forgot to mention the annoying Orc animations. Every time an orc comes up to you and he's high ranked or some sort of chief leader, you'll get pulled out of combat EVERY FRIGGIN TIME. Not sometimes, not the first time. EVERY FRIGGIN TIME. So for example, you are in this huge fight. And four captains show up. It will pull you out of combat FOUR TIMES and do a ""Hello, I'm a dumb orc"" animation EVERY FRIGGIN TIME. This is highly unyielding since most of the time I was in this epic 50 orc battle where I had an objective/task in mind, and the game decides that it's no big deal to just pull me out of it while I'm getting swung at from every direction.

Just oversight after oversight. Do not recommend."

This forces you to play the game the way the designers want you to, not the way YOU, the player wants to. And that's not fun, its intensely frustrating.

410,3,0.5644,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I love hack and slash games. In fact, one of the reasons I was very interested in playing this was because I LOVED the old LOTR games, both the Two Towers (for PS2) and ROTK were some of my favorite games back in the day.  

Let's get the good things out of the way first:

1. Graphics hold up really well for what is now an 8 year! old game. Could have released in the last year and wouldn't look very out of place.
2. The Voice Acting is phenomenal. Very good. The actors voicing both Talion and Celebrimbor especially are really very good.
3. Combat is Arkham inspired which is ok I guess?

However, the biggest issue with the game is how mind numbingly repetitive it is. Once you're in the 3-4h mark or so, you've basically seen everything. And now it's just a bland surrounding with some of the dumbest AI moving from A to B and muttering the same things. Some of the higher ranking ones have names and they are your ""Nemesis"" but it doesn't really mean anything. If you kill them, someone else will just replace them ad infinitum. Killing any orcs means absolutely nothing because they just respawn indefinitely.

This would've been somewhat acceptable if the story was really good. It is not. I don't even care that it's not official or canon or whatever. It's just bad, super cliched. Supporting cast is hyper generic.

I do not like leaving games in between so completed it with a 50% trophy rate but overall wouldn't recommend. It's a very forgettable game."

It's extremely repetitive, with simple combat where the hardest part is fighting with the controls (on keyboard and mouse), a forgettable story, and inconsequential decisions.

At first, the combat looks pretty neat. Until you have to repeat the same thing a few hundred, or a thousand times, over. It boils down to a mindless QTE-style rhythm game. You can be surrounded by hundreds of enemies but it doesn't even matter because only two of them will ever engage you at any one time. It's easy and bland once you've figured out the tempo.

The missions are basically the same. Kill this captain, multiplied a few hundred times. The formulaic 'quest' structure, combined with a boring combat, means it needs some story elements to prop it up. But it fails in that as well.

You play as Talion, some Hollywood-type hero figure that cannot die, can take on the whole Mordor army by himself, and is destined to be the saviour of whoever needs help. The trope is boring and done to death. First you beat up some weaklings, then beat up some bigger weaklings, then proceed to beat up even bigger weaklings, to finally end up QTE-ing the final boss weakling. Entirely forgettable. 

And since there is no consequence for failing, other than maybe making some captains stronger through the Nemesis system, the game has no weight. Once you can start branding, it gets even more ridiculous in terms of how easy the game gets. The equipment rune system looked somewhat interesting until you realise most are totally inconsequential. There are a few that might make an easy game even easier, but for the most part, all you'll ever need is to properly time your rhythmic combat. 

But even if you don't, it doesn't matter.

You will never fail. You will never lose. I got bored.

I'd go over to my friends house after school and on weekends and we would just run around slaying all who came before us. Playing this game now in 2022 has given me an entirely different perspective.

This is the story of Talion. A ranger who is banished from death, and on a course for revenge. This is an entirely overused hero trope that frankly makes the story uninteresting. The ONLY unique part of the game is the Army system. You can brand and control players in a large army, send them on missions, have them murder their leaders, its just a general good time. The story missions, however, are not a good time. They are bland and repetitive. ""Kill x amount of y enemy type in z minutes"" is used countless times. And man oh man, the final boss felt like a giant slap in the face. First, you fight a boss using only drains.

The nemesis system is a cool concept but is so horribly wasted on this game. Sneak into a stronghold to complete a mission and scan in advance for Captains that you might have to face? Well I hope you like them randomly spawning because even if you clear the entire stronghold without a single alarm more Uruks just spawn from nowhere including at least 3 other captains. Be in the middle of nowhere and fighting the only 3 Uruks in a 20 mile radius? I hope you like them magically appearing with 2 captains, a war chief, and 4 caragors that is sure to piss off at least one of the captains. QTE blocks? Hope you like your inputs not being recognized and being bodied over and over because recovering from an attack takes 3 seconds and the captains can attack you at least once every half a second. Don't waste your money, time, or hard drive space with this game. The developers clearly wanted to go for a Dark Souls difficulty without actually understanding how Dark Souls work so instead they just artificially ramp up the difficulty to punish you if you're actually doing well by sending infinite waves of Uruks and captains after you. The story mode was OK-ish, but it's far too short and if you're hoping for any kind of resolution to the conflicts it sets up you're going to be sorely disappointed. Just don't bother."

First Pros:
1. combat is very good and enjoyable
2. Graphics are far from bad not like OMG but they are quite good
3. Some of the harder missions feel good in the reward section its just about right
and thats all and only the pros I could think of
Cons:
1. You can and will get stuck on small little lips of an edge OHH and did I mention when starting you die in four hits about so if you get stuck on a ledge better start praying no orcs are around ;]
2 I know I did say that combat was good and that is true for the most part till you get to larger battle (20+ enemys) you start to put in more imputes that the game can handle causing your character to take actions that end up getting you hurt or killed
3. The fucking lion tiger thing there everywhere and there a pain in the ass plus they are usally in packs have fun ;]
4. And this is my most hated one is the respawn time of enemys spacificallly when you kill them, and listen when I tell you if you kill an enemy within 30 seconds they will be respawning and re-joining the fight which sucks cause you clear thirty enemies out and then bam there whole army is walking right back up to you before you can do ANYTHING!!!!
Disclaimer: This game is far from horrible and if you have the money I recommend buying it but only if its on sale. Also the reason I clicked thumbs down is simply becease of the respawn rates and other underling issues I havnt stated here. but this is just my two cents so please decide on your own and if you do get I hope you enjoy your journey...
TLDR, I know theres a lot of spelling errors I wrote this right after playing and with my blood pressure a little high if you know what I mean.

There they sat and made such a meal as they could. Keeping back the precious [/i]lembas[i] for the evil days ahead, they ate the half of what remained in Sam's bag of Faramir's provision: some dried fruit, and a small slip of cured meat; and they sipped some water. They had drunk again from the pools in the valley, but they were very thirsty again. There was a bitter tang in the air of Mordor that dried the mouth. When Sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed. Beyond the Morgai there was the dreadful plain of Gorgoroth to cross.

'Now you go to sleep first, Mr. Frodo,' he said. 'It's getting dark again. I reckon this day is nearly over.'

Frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken. Sam struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo's hand; and there he sat silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled from the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises, but there was no sound of voice or of foot. Far above the Ephel Dúath in the West the night-sky was still dim and pale. There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach. His song in the Tower had been defiance rather than hope; for then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment, his own fate, and even his master's, ceased to trouble him. He crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by Frodo's side, and putting away all fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep.

The result game is go through killing infinite, resurrecting, random orc to the mission objective. Really repetitive Action game. And story was not well-meshed into the gameplay. It could have been much better, but the system bone was meant to be like this. I can't recommend this.

1. To me, stealth is planning. Knockout this orc, kill that orc, and take this route to the objective. But in this game, stealth is not a plan, only just another way of killing. because the orcs are infinite and random. when detected, it's over. 

2. I think the orc captains UI is the master board of this game. kill this captain, dominate that captain, and make that orc to warchief.. plan your gameplay. System pushes me to do that. and campaign goes same way with this. Semi-Final object of this game is brand all 5 warchief. But you can't planning, While you planned something and fighting with some orc captain, boom! random other orc captain spawns and engage you in the fight. and if you die the masterboard rolled and changed. make plans meaningless. Sometimes, you should fight 2~3 random captian (not bodyguard of the warchief. I mean random spawned 2~3 captains..) moreover, if you killed captain, the orcs not die. they return to the pool and alloced some after. 

3. The cutscenes and voices are really meaningless. and annoying. If the orc captains had more background and stories in the game, it would have some meaning but it's not. moreover the orcs never die. they resurrected and you should heard the same orcs flavor text voice you have heard and killed some minutes ago. again and again and it's unskippable."

Having died 3 or 4 times so far, I've unlocked all of the tower regions on the first section's map for fast travel, but there's not much variety in the space between them. I got all the power-up I could doing side missions before doing the main story parts but it seems to make little difference when meeting some over-powered enemy. It's fun in the beginning and when you master the control system, but on the other hand the button control system, especially running whilst in stealth is a literal pain in my hands (holding down right trigger, pressing A and steering with right stick whilst running forward with left stick). Unlike other games I've never had my hands hurt so much just regularly playing with my xbox controller and that's really off-putting.

This review happened long after the era of Uncle Fammis and his best friend Doemin filling the occupational role of [i] 'Mummy' [/i]. I still had the [b] [u] The HP Pavilion 8615 [/u] [/b] and played it frequently, but Nana had long since passed and a lot of my siblings had disappeared or yet did still linger here, some even with children of their own. I was lucky enough to get to name two. A crooked little girl I called Pinda and a small headed boy I called Feeble Richard.
The new household-Mum was Doemins [i] Piss-Witch [/i] friend, Aunty Dah-Bah-Rah, or Aunt D-Bah for short. She knew [i] 'damp magics' [/i] and done her [i] 'wet-work' [/i] all throughout the house, which stank. Her [i] 'piss spells' [/i] were her main focus and it took a lot of trips to the shops for diet coke on our part to help keep her tummy cauldron bubbling. Every night she would soft squat in the doorway and gently moan into our bedrooms while wafting her Frumpus at us. I hated all of her smells and sounds. 
She knew how to keep all the different types of Dads that came over in check tho. Which we were all very grateful for, as there was too many unemployed men here all the time making it hard to concentrate or sleep.
Aunt Dah-Bah-Rah also attracted better tier Dads as well. One of the petrol job Dads had a ciggy yellow ekbok 360 with the this orc kill game on there. He brought that around hoping it would keep all us kids busy while he tried to help fuck Aunt D-Bah. It didn't work. I however was the only true gamer in the beef house and I played this Hobbitless game until I was sick and weak as I did with all new games.

[b] [u] Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ [/u] [/b]
This games best mechanic by far is how there is no women. All the orcs are sons and uncles with different dads of their own and get to walk around everywhere. 
I played this game for so many years but never finished it because I hate that things in my life ever come to an end when I love them.
You don't have to finish this game.
Tolkien would probably think this game was shit if he played it.
I fought through Mordor and never uncovered the truth of the spirit that compelled me to do so, which is not necessary.
I liked it at first.

I remember the time I took this game camping with me. It was pointless because there was no power or anything to play it on. We went to cousin Rats river shack which was situated by a stagnant dead tributary. It stank worse than Aunt D-Bahs [i] 'spells' [/i] and all of her sick chooks.
Cousin Rat lived in the shack with his 'Uncle Mum' and lots of brothers and sisters plus their friends as well. It wasn't heaps fun but it was a nice getaway from the Beef House since we couldn't go to Nans anymore.
One night all the kids were making a fussy around the small shitty fires while all the adults tried to smoke cigarettes and drink everything. Instead of getting in trouble like usual, two of the weekend dads decided to do something different, something other than hitting and yelling, they would teach us how to cook chocolate bears.
Needless to say we were all heaps excited and couldn't wait to learn how. We picked the healthiest ones of us to ride the horrible bikes to the servo about an hour or so away, as the weekend dads said we needed to steal heaps of packets of chocolate bears, but they also give us a fiver so we could buy a few and make it not look heaps suss.
We were also given hundreds of dollars to buy cigarettes for all the adults. 
But, because Nan chose me to grow biggest long ago, I was unable to operate a bike and had to stay. My whole body is basically useless.
They were gone for so long and there was absolutely nothing to do. Some of the dads and mums got into fights with each other while others poured petrol on fires, both of which was met with raucous hooting and cheering.
By the time the ones that were sent came back with the cigarettes and bears the sun was coming up and most of the adults were asleep. We couldn't find the weekend dads that were going to teach us so we decided to figure it out for ourselves. As I was the eldest and biggest kid boy there at 22 I thought it should be me to try first. My idea was to keep the chocolate bears in your mouth and gum them so they got hot and wet and soft, essentially cooking them into a mushy bearish pudding. 
Cousin Rats idea was to sit on piles of them like an egg clutch and get them to [i] 'crush-melt' [/i] .
All us kids had so many ways to try and cook the bears.
Eventually one of the weekend dads woke up, he was sleeping under a car. We all sprinted at him screaming our ideas and showing him our various cooking methods. 
We were all wrong.
He angrily snatched up a packet of chocolate bears, he then leaned into the car and pulled out one of the harry foils and began crushing the chocy bears in there. Once it was full he poured some yummy old pepsi in and quickly screwed it all up. He then put the balled up old harry foil full of old pepsi and crushed up biscuits into the ashes of a dying fire. He told us it would be ready in twelve minutes...
The end result was like burnt ovaltine.

When we got back from Cousin Rats I went to play [b] [u] Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™ [/u] [/b] but when I opened the case it was full of red dry riverland dust and the disc was covered in scratches.
It wouldn't play anymore.

Amazing game but not worth a dime without the DLC's being included."
473,3,0.5099,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Pros:
+Very stable game, in the 38 hours I played the game, there were no crashes, the performance was smooth, and there were pretty much no bugs, the only technical issues I had were that the right-click controls wouldn't always register (specifically the click itself; holding the right mouse button worked fine) and a few terrain bits blocking movement when they probably shouldn't have.

+Animations and cinematics are top-notch quality, it almost feels like a shame that such effort for them went into a game like this instead of something else (see the cons section for as to why).

+The game doesn't let you manually save, and auto-saves everything worth saving, so you can just focus on playing the game, instead of worrying about hitting that quick-save button every now and then.

+The overall atmosphere fits well into a game about Middle Earth.

Cons:
-The nemesis system, which at the time when this game was released was praised as a new innovation, might seem interesting at first, but quickly becomes boringly repetitive. The randomly generated uruk captains and warchiefs just don't feel interesting enough, they have generic weaknesses that you can usually exploit to instantly kill them, making their strengths pointless (which are pretty generic also). Possibly the worst part is how they reflect the realities of the Middle Earth universe: you can keep killing the uruk leaders as much as you want, but others will simply take their place, and you're back to where you started. It makes you wonder, why even bother?

-This is an open-world game, but while it's full of life (namely uruks and slaves), it doesn't feel realistic, because everything respawns so quickly. You can liberate a slave caravan, and as you do so, a new uruk gang spawns a short distance behind you, then when you go slaughter them, more uruks will have spawned where you previously liberated a slave caravan. The only ""permanent"" change you can make into the world is complete outcast rescue missions, which makes them more likely to fight back against the uruks, and has them offer you intel against the uruk leaders more often. That's it. Instead of an open-world game and the nemesis system, I would've preferred a more linear and quality-crafted experience.

-The DLC campaigns are their own separate things, they don't carry over to the main game, and it honestly sucks, because playing them separately like that feels very amateurish, as if they were fanfiction stories and not proper production.

-The ending is a cliffhanger (granted, the story up to that point was pretty good), and lacks a certain choice that the player should be able to make. I'm not gonna spoil what the choice would be, although you might be able to predict it as you play... then again, you probably don't want to play this game to begin with.

Overall:
I didn't mention anything about the combat, because I can't decide whether it's ultimately good or bad, basically it's a combination of a rhythm game and QTEs, so make of that what you will. But other than that, the game feels very satisfying several times, and yet the satisfaction always fades off disappointingly quickly. All in all, it just feels very average.

It has fun mechanics, but gets repetitive quite quickly. The visuals look nice, though a little bit dated now as far as art style goes. It just feels a little too derivative of assassin's creed. Towers, run around doing parkour, kill orcs. 

As for the rival system - I remember when this game came out. Everyone was going crazy saying that it was a gaming revolution. It isn't. Oh, look, a guy that ran away is on a different part of the map and spouts some line about the last time we fought! Yeah. Not really that impressive. 

Finally, the story. It just really falls flat. It isn't all that interesting, and as far as creating player immersion, it doesn't go to much lengths at all. The beginning happens far too quickly for you to really care about any of the characters as no love for them has been developed at all. The dialogue between you and Torvin is too much like a comic relief. In all the areas in between, there is no story at all. 

The final battle and subsequent final boss fight took me no more than 15 minutes. Then it was over. That's it. It was really anticlimactic and the rushed feeling of the latter half of the game just makes it feel like they had much more planned but someone high up said, ""hey guys, we gotta push this out next week so wrap it up."" It had a lot of potential but just didn't make it to the heights it could have, and for that reason I can't recommend this to other players.

Now for the most important part tho, how deep does it dive into the LOTR-universe?
As a HUGE fan of tolkiens works, I was really excited to finally play this game but it sadly only features really bland and generic story elements from the lore, not really showing you anything new EXCEPT for the actual original content which is just another ""man lost everything and now seeks revenge"" who gets over the deaths of his loved ones within the same cutscene of experiencing them, making ANY kind of emotinal response from the player feel unrewarded.
In my opinion, had they made the game the exact same way but just refered to Mordor and other key names with different ones instead (therefore not making it a ""LOTR-game""), it would have probably been not as ""famous"" as it is today.

Try it out if you are interested, the gameplay in the beginning is REALLY fun but gets IMO way too stale since killing is all you do.

Strange line to begin a review, isn't it?   One cannot - and should not - judge things simply as others judge them.  Game reviews are typically focused on graphics, story line, play mechanics.   In this game,I have no quibble with the first two although I would add the remark that this game is typical for what is now expected. At least as far as I was able to play it. Eight years ago, it was 'high-end' or 'top-shelf' and deservedly so.   It bears scant resemblance  to it's original author's creation; it is more of a gamer's loose interpretation with elements changed to make it 'game-able'.   That's to be expected but it does make the orcs and other residents (at least in the early stages) seem rather one-dimensional.   I like characters with a bit more depth.

That is, perhaps, to judge the game harshly, especially considering it's release date.  So I'll say this: those who like open world hack-n-slash games will probably revel in this.   There isn't ton of open world freedom nor is there much freedom in attack strategies.  Some, but not much.   Not a deal killer for most.  The graphics and the play-ability are good, if not great -- again, insofar as I was able to play it.

My complaint is in play mechanics since I was never able to get passed the Dark Monument mission.  The game is programmed in such a way as to defeat 'trainers' and other assistive software that make these games playable for those who have needs outside that typically considered by game developers.  The main missions cannot be altered from a tight script which basically means you have to play it exactly as the developer's want it played or it will fail.   It isn't necessarily the case that developer's deliberately set out to do so (although, some clearly do) but the net effect for me is that I cannot use any tool that I normally would to overcome my particular limitations in order to play this game beyond this particular point.

I know that there are a host of you reading this just bristling because I use a trainer or 'cheat' in order to enjoy gaming.   You don't live in my world nor understand the need to use this in order to find gaming recreative instead of endlessly frustrating.   Frankly, I think most of you fail to realize just how often people, including you and your compatriots, use them but deny it.  That, however, is a debate for some other time.   

I cannot recommend the game because, after all the years I've owned it and all the countless attempts to get passed this particular mission both with and without the use of assistive software, I could not do so and so have wasted my money and my time.   Many will find this review pointless because their world is not the world I live in (so to speak).  Yet there are others who do use assistive software and they should be warned that they will be unable to complete most of the game if they do so.

I do wish developer's would be more open to the needs of the minority who wish to play but lack physical/mental resources to do so."

[b] Full Review [/b] 
I saw someone playing this game and thought it looked fun so I bought it. I played the first few missions and then just didn’t have any motivation to keep playing. The combat system is good, being very similar to the Arkham Batman games and the running and climbing mechanics are very fluid like the Assassin’s Creed games. So in principle the foundation of the game is sound but I went through a few more cycles of playing for a mission or two and then losing interest. I was really  struggling to put my finger on exactly what was wrong but I really wasn’t engaged in by the game.

At this point I realised what it was. The reason I like open world game is the variety of game play. You have the intensity of the main missions when you are in the mood for that but you also have the relaxing side activities like collecting flowers when you are in the mood for that. It is this second part that this game fails to get right. When I was in the mood for doing some casual side activities I’d look at the map, see a collectible then see the hoards of orks I’d have to fight my way through to get to it and lose motivation to play. The map is so full of orks that the collecting side activities are simply not relaxing.

Then as I played a bit more and failed a few missions I lost interest in the game all together. The missions weren’t impossible but I hadn’t become invested in the plot to really care. They just became so the effort required to complete them outweighed the reward of completing them. The game has this odd mechanic where if an ork captain defeats you then they become more powerful. Yeah that’s going to help me complete a mission I’m struggling with if the game just keeps making it more difficult. When I said the combat was like the Arkham Batman games there is a key difference. In Batman the fights are generally quite limited with only a small cluster of opponents. Here you have a never ending supply of orks trying to kill you. One time I was trying to do a side archery missions where I was restricted to a small area and a bunch of orks attacked me. As I fought them, more and more orks joined the fight. I was there for about 20 minutes before the finally wore me down and killed me. 

The power struggles between orks had potential to be interesting but in reality it was very unsatisfying. You could kill ork captains and things shuffle round but ultimately nothing of significance changed. Especially when some of the orks you kill just come straight back. I killed this one captain 3 times in the course of 15minutes. Every time I set off to do something else he just reappeared until I ended up quitting.

After a week or so away from the game I installed a cheat engine. I was on the fence about either doing this or just abandoning the game completely. Using this to make my character undetectable gave me the casual collecting experience I was looking for and god mode made most the missions trivial. However even with the difficulty barriers removed I just didn’t care about the plot. I got to the part where a new map is opened up and there is a whole new army of orks to deal with and at that point I realised I had better things to do with my life and abandoned the game."

The result made me laugh uproariously at the absurdist dance my character and his beloved Uruks were performing on-screen, degenerating into genuine anger as I stab another Uruk with stars over his unconscious body, being struck before the animation finishes and watching him inevitably rise yet again, good as new. I have never felt more powerless in a game. I will try again with a controller to see if I missed something.

Also the story is terrible and hurriedly told, the area map essentially a single level from a better game, all uniform and ugly, in the visuals and sounscapes. It is essentially a crap 3D roguelike, restarting from one spot in this pseudo-randomly-generated Gulag the game takes place in every time. I realise this is an old game but , Good Lord."

503,3,0.4958,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This game is a perfect example of everything wrong with the gaming industry, in my opinion:

1. Instead of teaching you how to play the game through gameplay the developers decided it would be a good idea to interrupt the flow of the game and have a pop-up telling you exactly what to do in every dangerous situation, removing all real danger from the situation and providing you with the perfect guide on how to beat the game in a single attempt. 

2. The Army of Sauron gimmick is simply padding and doesn't need to be included in the game whatsoever; the only difference it would make if they removed the entire system would be about 5 hours of ""gameplay."" It is simply included to artificially lengthen the game and provide an endgame grind to keep you playing after you beat the main story. The Uruk introductions are the most jarring and disruptive inclusions, it puzzles me why they thought freezing time around you to have the orc say 'Hi my name is Jim, I like cats and long walks on the beach' in the middle of a battleground was an okay thing to do. Not only does it disrupt the flow of the game just like the tutorials, but each and every captain, warchief, private, general, corporal, etc. feels the need to introduce himself like it's a speed dating service which is extremely annoying when you have 5+ named Uruks in a single battle. At one point I actually got up and got a drink of water because of all the introductions mid-combat and didn't die by the time I came back and sat down. It really kills any sense of adrenaline you could have gotten from the fairly easy and forgiving combat system.

3. The story is not well thought out or told at all. It plays out like a really bad fan-fiction LOTR reddit post. There are tons of plot holes, rewriting the original lore of the franchise, and inserting extremely powerful characters that would ruin the story if they were included in the main canonical books and movies. I feel like if they just renamed and removed all references to LOTR it would be a mediocre game at best. I did enjoy Celebrimbor's story, but the main character's story is just meh.

4. The ""boss"" design is atrocious. [spoiler]The black hand of Sauron and the Tower were boss fights I was really looking forward to using all the knowledge, skill, upgrades, weapon runes, and Uruk warchiefs I spent hours building up throughout the entire course of the game. Needless to say, I had never been more disappointed in a boss ""fight"" ever. They are simply quick-time events and don't require any skill or knowledge of the combat system at all. I'm guessing they meant the nemesis fights to be the real boss fights while the main antagonists are just there for the story. The major issue with that is the nemesis fights were so easy that I basically just afked while my overpowered warchiefs killed the nemesis pretty much on their own, so I was completely robbed of any challenging boss fight at all.[/spoiler]

5. Quick-time events. I don't mind the occasional quick-time event in really over-the-top situations, but this game overuses quick-times in almost every major event during the main quest. I would prefer if games never used quick-time events and just made any quick-time events cutscenes instead. They don't require any skill and usually create really frustrating situations when your attention wanes and you miss a single button press and fail an entire mission as a result. 

6. Cosmetic skins in a singleplayer story game... I usually don't hate on skins in multiplayer games, I don't mind them at all, but when they're included in a singleplayer story-based game, they should probably at least not break the lore of the entire game. A good example of skins in a singleplayer game would be in Red Dead Redemption 1. IIRC you can change your outfit, you're still the same character, and your outfit changes during cutscenes. This game doesn't bother with any of those silly concepts. You can play as entirely different characters and magically shapeshift back into the main character during cutscenes! Immersion be damned, we need to include skins because reasons.

In conclusion, I really wanted to love this game and immerse myself into Middle-Earth, but the game simply fought me at every chance it got. I actually knew I hated the combat system before I even started playing and still gave the game a real chance to win me over. I absolutely hate the nonsensical DDR rhythm style combat of Arkham/Witcher, but whatever I can deal with it if the rest of the game is well designed, but unfortunately it is not. If you like quick-times and Witcher/Arkham combat with no regard for story, then go for it; it's actually a great game if that's all you're interested in. I got the game for sale at I think $10.00 and I still regret my purchase. I'm even more annoyed that I need to play through the sequel which I made the mistake of buying before this game, but hopefully they fixed the major issues I had with this game instead of making the same game-design flaws over again."

This might just be my own opinion, but the next couple issues I have are not.

The camera sort of moves all over the place by itself and the player doesn't have any control over it. Often when I'm fighting a horde of Uruks the camera will zoom in to fixate on my current target so that I can't see counterable attacks coming at me. In that way, the combat is really poorly optimized. ON THE OTHER HAND, the combat feels really satisfying once you get into the flow.

Another plus is how accurate everything feels to the movies. Sometimes to the point of deja vu! The main character Talion is basically Aragorn. 

The thing that ultimately led me to give it ""Nay"" on the recommendation is the lack of replayability the game features. I probably played about 20 hours on the PS4 messing with the really cool Orc warchief progression system and never finishing it. Here I am 3 years later playing the game on the PC to realize how linear the story is. You're allowed to run around in the world wherever you want, but there are no choices to be made. You'll always end up doing the same missions.

TLDR: Fast progression (Far Cry style), cool orc warchief system, art and story are accurate to the movies, linear story with very little replayability."

I play with mouse and keyboard, I'm also happens to be left handed and since both my hands are not attached to left side of my body, I can't play with WASD, I'm playing with cursor keys, numeric pad while holding mouse with left hand. 

While I was trying the change key bindings, I noticed I cannot use half of the buttons on right side of my keyboard. [ ] / \ "" : keys are not allowed and remaining are just shift, ctrl and alt (that is too far) and 6 buttons above cursor keys. 

Then I started the ""tutorial"" and immediately discovered that my keyboard doesn't have enough keys to bind for every action required. to play this game you will need a keyboard with 630 keys all arranged in circle around your middle finger.

Some actions require me to hold a button and then press movement button and then also press space or mouse keys. I found it to be impossible for me to do such thing unless I grow an extra hand, trust me, I even tried to use my nose, but the position was a little too uncomfortable while trying to see the monitor too.

In conclusion it seems developers never used an actual keyboard and mouse to play the game. and just put those key bindings there for the sake of saying controller is not required, however in fact playing without one is almost impossible and even a controller that doesn't have 300 keys and the back, top and side, doesn't have enough keys to do all the actions required.

Next I noticed in cut scenes the music and noise is louder than voice of the person talking. that was because I reduced master volume to 50%, music to 10% and ambient to 60%, since the game considers the sound over cut scenes either music or ambient, it is almost impossible to hear over the noise of war or wind.

Even though I got this game on huge discount, still cannot recommend it to left handed players and hoping some day, game developers develop some respect for left handed gamers too."

Gameplay is oriented around this 'nemesis' system, which apparently the team behind the game is very proud of. It is not a bad system by design, the thing is, it lacks depth and including DLC you will go through defeating 5 warlords 4 times, so it gets repetitive.
Stealth is likely best part of the game, as it is still somewhat tactical, but at the same time can be quite fast paced, sadly you can't just complete every mission with stealth.
Combat is 'different', it is hard to say if it is good or bad, in the end it comes to stacking combo high enough to trigger a finisher. Frustrating part of this is that meaningfull enemies have some random resistances, so you often just need to repeat stacking combo and using finishers, otherwise they take no damage.
When it comes to the setting and the story, as a LotR fan I was disappointed. If you read some books, you may recognize a few characters, but it pretty much comes down to Sauron and Golum otherwise. The story is quite bad, it is there but you can clearly see that it was meant to just provide some background, rather than having any meaning."

Let's start with the story, since that is the most obvious aspect. Despite it being set in the Lord of the Rings universe, the game doesn't feel connected to the main narrative, and its few connecting elements are little more than keys to dangle in front of the fanboys. Gollum makes an appearance, because he gets forced into everything even slightly LotR-related, despite how unpleasant and annoying he has been in every single appearance he has ever made. Other callbacks include daggers being a broken sword (how original!), as well as a few quotes lifted straight out of the movies. However, other than those frankly insulting callbacks, there is little that sets this game apart. Say what you want about Tolkien, as overrated as I think he his, he was able to imbue a very black-and-white good-vs-evil conflict with a lot of character. This is where Shadow of Mordor fails, and the world feels simultaneously pretentious, with every common item having an awful anime-name, and yet incredibly derivative.
When it comes to gameplay, Shadow of Mordor continues Warner Brothers' trend of garbage PC ports. Controls are entirely contextual and illogical. For example, the 'use' or 'action' key being bound to Ctrl feels incredibly uncomfortable, and there are plenty of times where sprinting will have you climbing up walls, with no elegant way of getting down again. These clunky controls go just *great* (sarcastic voice) with some of the terrible mission design, including plenty of instant-fail forced stealth sections, often on a countdown. It's a little Assassin's Creed, a little Arkham Asylum, and a whole bunch of frustration!
Warner Bros is an awful company, both in movies and video games, and should rightfully be mentioned alongside Ubisoft, Activision-Blizzard, Rockstar/Take2, and EA's sports division as absolute scumbags, whose products are not worth your money unless pirated or at a steep discount. While Shadow of Mordor may be a perfectly alright game, is does not have a single original bone in its body, or thought in its head.

Oh, and finally, the music reminds me of Vampyr. It makes me want to play that game, because its story and characters are much better!

Rating: 2/5 Stars

Shadow of Mordor, a game that promised an exciting and immersive experience in the world of Middle-earth, quickly reveals itself to be a tedious and uninspired grindfest. The combat system, which should be one of the main selling points, is nothing more than a repetitive button-mashing exercise.

Players will find themselves constantly spamming one button to defeat hordes of infinitely generated orcs, leading to an unsatisfying and monotonous gaming experience. This lack of variety and depth in combat is a significant letdown for those hoping for a more engaging and challenging adventure.

In conclusion, Shadow of Mordor is a disappointing title marred by boring gameplay and an unenjoyable combat system. If you're looking for an exciting and challenging game set in the world of Middle-earth, it's best to pass on this one and continue your search elsewhere."

The controls are awful. Want to attack an enemy in front of you? Just hold W and click. Good job. We'll attack the one directly behind you. Want to run around this wooden beam? Nah, just stand there having a staring contest with it. Want to run up this wall? Oh I thought you wanted to just hug it for 2 seconds, take an arrow in the ass, and THEN climb up it. Want to do literally anything? Have fun struggling. Almost every action you do except attacks will have a 0.5-1 second delay. Not due to input lag (since attacks/parries work fine), just due to a very bad attempt at realism. I'm 215 lbs, 5'10"", and out of shape, but I can react faster than this guy. That shouldn't be the case. There's a line between realism and just clunky.

Stealth is not terrible but still pretty bad. Enemies will see you when they shouldn't be able to (and not see you when they really should be able to) and the fact that a lot of the main missions have forced stealth makes it all the more frustrating. Animations take waaaaay too long so you'll find yourself getting spotted because homeboy needs to make every execution an event or feels like taking his sweet time in freeing a prisoner even though there's an orc 5 feet away. I've also been spotted several times when chilling in bushes so, like, what's the point of the bushes?

Story well, barely exists. It just kinda throws you in and assumes you care (presumably because they thought everyone playing this would be a Tolkein fanboy/girl?). No real backstory or ""getting to know characters"" phase, just a lot of forced dialogue and narrative. Main character is cliche and uninteresting. And from what I hear, the game only takes about 30 hours to pretty much 100%.

Combat is just an altered version of the Batman games but, given the absolutely god-awful controls, it ends up being inherently worse. I never liked the early Mario games because I don't think that fighting awful character control should be a challenge but these devs apparently love that. FFS, just dodge dude. It's not rocket science. That's not to say it's hard. You can literally faceroll the combat. There's a great video of a guy doing just that. Seriously, look it up, it's titled something like ""The combat in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is terrible"" I think. And he's not wrong.

This is not aided by the buggy/poorly designed spawning system that will just drop more orcs on you without warning or reason. Want to kill this captain? Checked the whole area and made sure that he's relatively open to attack? Not in a stronghold or anything? Cool, I'm going to go attack. Yes, I got him down to almost dead! What? Forced mini-cutscenes telling me that 2 new captains are 20 feet away from me? I literally saw one blip into existence!  <--- this happened to me in this exact way. How do you miss the mark that much? 

I'm attempting a return. That's $6 I can spend towards a game that actually works. Again, just shocked that anyone actually likes this game, let alone having many 9/10 reviews and GOTY. Gamers have really lowered their standards, I guess."

This is a tough one to give a thumbs up or down but at the end of the day this isn't a rating of good or bad but a ""would I recommend this to people I know?"". And the answer is, depends on who you are and what you're looking for. More so than for many other games I've reviewed.

[h1]The good[/h1]
I should say, I'm a huge Tolkien fan. With all that in mind, why is it fun? Shadow of Mordor renders a pretty good version of Mordor. The orcs are very well made, both in the tone of personality and gameplay. The hierarchy system works well. And speaking of gameplay, killing them is quite fun it gets more fun the further you climb in the skill tree and the second-half of the game skills make you feel very cool and powerful. Reminds me of the old LotR games in some ways. But make no mistake, this game is ABOUT killing orcs. Everything else is an afterthought. 

If you like lore (which I do), a good amount of it is littered around the map in form of collectables. The voice acting is fantastic for all characters. And cutscenes (about the Celebrimor's past) are quite well made. I guess I'm starting to grasp at straws here looking for things to praise... So:

[h1]The bad[/h1]
You may have already caught a glimpse of what bugs me - I said this is a game about killing orcs. It feels like this was made by a group of people who thought that killing orcs is the best and most interesting part of the Tolkien universe. But orcs are filler. And that's what this whole game largely feels like. 

The combat is better than most Assassin's Creed games but what makes AC games good is that they have an interesting and rich world despite the bland gameplay. Shadow of Mordor however does not because, and I feel a bit bad saying this, Mordor is not a very interesting place. It's an arena for killing orcs. A saving grace is that the game is relatively short (at around 15-20 hours) but every time you hope for something interesting. Usually it's just you having to kill more orcs.

There is a narrative and some characters (of which maybe two are interesting - Celebrimor and Torvin) but at every turn the story very blatantly tries to be as grey as possible, it's entirely based off of scenes from the LotR movies whilst not literally being those same scenes and it's filled with direct quotes from said movies which feel forced into the places you find them. The story is designed to be immediately forgettable and only serves as a neutral backdrop for inserting orc combat and LotR movie quotes. Every character except for those two I mentioned earlier is a bargain bin blank variant of a movie character.

So all that's left to do is:

[h1]Coming to terms[/h1]
Maybe you really do just want to kill orcs. Without a good narrative reason (which is what makes it good in the movies). Yeah yeah ok, last rant, I promise. It's a good hack & slash game which is also set in the Tolkien universe and if that's what you want you may very well be satisfied. It's not that bad but I want at least one truly good modern-day Tolkien videogame and I get agitated when having to settle for less.

[h1]Side note on DLC[/h1]
I didn't actually play through the DLC's all the way but quite plainly one tasks you with replaying a speed run version of the first (of two) game zones and the other does that same for the second zone. Plus some reskins. If you want to play the game a second time, maybe it's your jam. I did not."

The 6 hours gameplay has been rolled back. I only have one save slot so its not as if I'm running an old save. My character progression from those 6 hours (in terms of skill ups, unlocks etc.) remain so its managed to save that, leading me to believe my save file remains uncorrupted. So what gives?

Shadow of Mordor relies too heavily on its combat to carry it as far as it tries to go.

The combat is stupidly easy and is just button mashing X and sometimes hitting Y or A. The controls for moving are poorly thought out - you can only walk or sprint, no in between, so you end up holding A the entire game. Not only that, but holding A is also the control to climb and jump, so half the time when you want to run through a door he starts climbing the wall instead. The aiming for ranged mode feels super janky, like auto-aim that doesn't actually help you aim. The enemy captains are uninteresting tougher versions of regular enemies. The map is a lot, and I mean a lot, smaller than I expected. I don't even know how you could consider this ""open world"". The leveling system doesn't really make sense either. So overall, you have a game that looks great, but feels like a worse version of assassins creed that was skinned to look like a LOTR rip off.

1, Unlike other games with stealth, sneaking around and trying to clear out mobs around the boss your hunting doesn't work, because mobs keep spawning at an incredible rate.

2. Creatures don't generally die unless you use a kill move, which is impossible to do without being attacked if there is more than 2-3 creatures, which means that if you get stuck in combat with more than a few creatures all you can do is run away while there are swarms of creatures attacking you.

3. There are very few mass damage capabilities compared to how many times you get swarmed with creatures and even if there were more ways to do more damage, see point 2.

4. Ranged combat is EXTREMELY limited. The game would be playable if you could whittle down the scores of creatures you have to fight from a distance, but even if you unlock all the arrow space, you still only get relatively few arrows before you need to find more, which is hard to do because of their scarcity combined with the utter garbage stealth system in the game.

While I did enjoy the map system, the boss system, the quests and some of the story elements, it's too bad that 90% of the time you just get mucked up in a combat with 30+ orcs without a way to deal with it except hop around swinging at things and using your worthless abilities until you inevitably die.

The combat controls are not much better. You try sprinting from enemies and accidentally jump on them then get knocked down. You try sprinting away and accidentally climb walls.... You get stuck in long attack chain animations which you can not break and are completely vulnerable to attacks. Also, you dont choose what enemies you want to attack. Spam the attack button and Talion will just swing wildly at basically everything around him (sometimes he will even jump away from the target you want to attack and attack something else 8-10yds away).

Also, and this might just be me, but I'm tired of games that reveal a chunk of the map at a time and give you 50 different activities to do right from the start.  They stop feeling like quests and start to feel like chores.

Well, perhaps it's because I've played through the whole Arkham series, but the gameplay felt way too easy. Starting off, you fight some orcs. When things get really difficult, well, the creators draw on the whole creative list of creatures of Middle Earth and attack you with MORE orcs! By the time I was 15% of the way through the game, I could handle wave after wave of orcs with no problem. The boss fights were quick, generally unimaginative, and got progressively easier as you worked your way through the game.

And that's just the lackluster combat system. The world itself was pretty enough, but monotonous. No snowy mountains to climb up. No forests to explore. No cities to defend. No mines to delve into. The scenery quickly got boring.

The combat is solid it controls okay and there's not much inherently wrong with it at it's core. The story mode is pretty uninspired and definitely doesn't fit the lord of the rings setting. You could slap any generic fantasy on this really. Lots of elements of the story mode are lazily designed too, I won't spoil the final boss but those who have played know what I'm talking about. However, despite the uninspired story mode the trials of war is a great mode that takes full advantage of this game's biggest innovation, the nemesis system. This is where most of my play time is and it's a blast, the open world feels truly open in this mode and seeing captains who killed you or where a problem moving up gets you really invested in their downfall. At ten dollars there's a decent amount of fun to be had in this mode alone.

HOWEVER. That's the game itself, this port is HORRENDOUS. It takes up a ludicrous amount of space and it runs like a fifth grader with two shot out kneecaps. It stutters loading damn near anything, pop ins are constant and the frame rate dips happen routinely. Even on the disgustingly low graphical settings you'll need to have the game on for it to run properly it will STILL lag routinely. You can tell this is a lazy PC port as they didn't even bother changing the tutorial graphics to have keyboard icons. Not that this game controls well on keyboard anyway, play it with a controller if you can. In fact, play it elsewhere if you can. For a sale price you might find some worthwhile fun lodged in it but I can't recommend this port. If any other version of this game is accessible to you play that instead. This is an awful port"

Every location looks the same and there is no reward for exploration. The combat is a rip-off of the Arkham series which doesn't translate well to sword-play. By far the worst aspect of this game is the Nemesis system. When an orc kills you, it levels up, becoming harder to kill. If it kills you again, it levels up again. When a group of orcs kills you, every single one of them levels up. If you know you can't win the fight so you decide to leave, they level up when you leave. The game becomes less playable with every mistake you make, and you're never given the chance to learn what SHOULD be done until it CAN'T be done. I was trying to do the Story Missions but got stuck because the game said I needed to kill more Orc Captains. By this point, I was Level 5 but every Orc Captain was Level 15 or above. I could neither attack them nor could I defend myself against their attacks. And frequently, a second or even third Orc Captain would join the fight, turning my already-impossible task into a hopeless execution. By the end, I was dying once every 60 seconds. I couldn't go anywhere or do anything without getting killed and making my already-omnipotent enemies even stronger. I was completely powerless to move forward so my only option left was to start the game completely over again.

I played through the tutorial, fixed some of the default settings, and got into a few fights before being so turned off by this game I had to just alt+f4. I think the Idea of this game is cool, however there were a few big reasons I really disliked it. 

1. Camera Angle. The camera angle way too close to see anything. The camera is so close the character takes up about 2/3 of the screen. I could not see where enemies were, in or out of combat (lucky as problem 3 will discuss this doesn't matter).
2. Control over camera. Controlling the view point was also nearly impossible, even with maxed out sensitivity I can not turn around fast enough to look at what I wanted to look at. Out of combat it is very difficult to walk around, I literally had to do a full mouse swipe 3 times to make the character do a 360. In combat you are basically stuck looking what ever direction you stated the fight looking at. You just simply don't have the time to swipe the mouse fast enough to move the camera while spamming the attack button. NOTE: this may not be a problem with a controller. 
3. Combat. Half of my problem here is that I do not like quick time event combat. However, I do not think this game implements quick time event based combat very well. Firstly, fights take way too long, every fight I got into took several minutes to complete. This would be fine if the combat was more interesting, however, you can win fights by just spamming left click. You do not need to parry or choose a target, you can win fights by just repeatedly pressing left click. The main character just twirls around slapping random orcs with his glorified pool noodle while the 20 other orcs patiently stand their and wait for their turn to get slapped. Maybe I'm being unfair and this genre of game just isn't for me. I don't have very much experience with quick time event games, maybe this is one of the better ones, I don't know, but it was not fun for me. 

I wouldn't be so negative if it wasn't set in the Lord of the Rings universe. If this were some small indie game I would maybe be able to overlook these problems, but a triple A game for a beloved franchise should be better than this.

A man whose family was killed rises and seeks for his revenge. This is a very brief description of the plot, which I, honestly, stopped perceiving after several hours in. All the Uruks killed all my interest in it. But I'll get to it.
[hr][/hr]
First - graphics of the game is just ok. There is nothing really special to be seen, but it was released in 2014, so I probably wouldn't await it to be any better. It is quite poor to see that there are not many different textures, building patterns etc. There is not really rich musical background, but there were few moments that enlighted the walkthrough.
[hr][/hr]
Second - in the beggining of my review I mentioned the plot. There is SOME, but nothing really catchy. It just reminds you of days when you started your first D&D, and you didn't know what to say about your character, so you just set it as a ""let's go for a revenge guy"". I believe that it might be bit more interesting for people who read all Tolkien's books, and love his world.
[hr][/hr]
Third - collectibles are not that bad in this game. There are signs that always reveal you a piece of the whole portrait, and items where there are a dialogues that deepen the background. They are, together with challenges, interesting enrichment of the game.
[hr][/hr]
Third - let's get to the point. So far my review seemed more positive than negative. But in my opinion, this game is quite bad. Ok, I understand it is hack'n'slash, but it is a terrible one. When you want to get somewhere, you have to kill like a ton of Uruks (who respawn, so the fights sometimes get too long, too boring) just to get to your quest which is - ok, you get it.. killing Uruks. The quests just specify which Uruks should you kill. I don't want to say that there are not other quests.. but when they are, they are mostly something like ""ok, follow me/him/whoever and collect it/that/whatever"". Side quests are just the same. 
[hr][/hr]
So my overall opinion? I was drawn into the game for first 3-4 hours and I wanted more and more Uruks so I could fight them. After doubling this ingame time I got strongly bored. I believe that even a game of this genre can be done much better.

the fight animations are great but the combat gets very boring very quickly. the challenge is never in the fighting but more about avoiding detection and setting off alarms!!?!? 

just a mess of a game really that'll pull you left, right and all over the place...asking you to grab 3 of these, go here, do this, upgrades available, hold B to drain....power struggle this, go do that....blah blah fucking blah!!

Progression was... okay. Your ability to counter and use finishers is 90% of the combat. Everything else just becomes extra flair or allows you to abuse finishers even more. 

I was intrigued by the nemesis system but ended up burnt out by the gameplay loop. The bulk of the game is simply go to map markers to use counters and finishers to kill orcs. 

The game could benefit from some breathing room in between missions as well. As soon as you finish a mission, it's just GO GO GO to the next one. Never a moment to breathe.

This game is yet another Assassins Creed wannabe game, where it feels like some company than owns rights for a story wants to expand into games, so they pick a genre thats popular, and then stuff everything into that. But this game plays like a worse version of the original Assassins Creed, a game released 7 years prior. 7 YEARS.

The combat is boring, its one button over and over until you need to press a different button, to either counter or kill. 

The collectables are only lore.

668,3,0.3962,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","So, finally, ages after it's initial release I went to play Shadow of Mordor.

The gameplay follows the, now very infamous, ""Assassin's Creed colecthaton open world"" school of gamedesign down to a T, with combat reminiscent of the Batman ""Arkham series"" (and similarly boring... seriously, I never imagined something like fighting two scores of orcs and uruks at the same time could be so tedious and easy). 

As for the story, wow, what a dumpster fire. Even though I don't really care all that much for Tolkien's ouvre, I still felt the sharp change in mood the characters and the world underwent for the sake of needlessly embracing the ever so silly ""darker, edgier, grittier"" themes (woe to the always destined to die families of all these tormented male antiheroes). Most noticeable of all was Celebrimbor himself, who went from a kind and selfless artificer and leader who crafted the three elven rings of power in secret (and then sent them into hiding and endured torture at the hands of Sauron to protect their whereabouts) to a jackass with an attitude and delusions of grandeur who helped Sauron craft all the rings of power, was weirdly obsessed with stealing the Dark Lord's shinies AND, at one point, even controled an army of orcs himself.

It's at times like these that I wonder, 'why did I even bother buying this? Even if it iwas deeply discounted..."". These Steam deals are gonna be the death of me -_-"

I've played through Shadow of Mordor twice now (Once on Xbox and now on PC) and both times felt like something was missing. This game is lots of fun, don't get me wrong. Brutally murdering Uruk-hai like cutting blades of grass never gets old, but it feels like they were testing things out with this game before making the full version. (Shadow of War)

Buy this game if starting a series in the middle doesn't sit well with you, you would like a mix of Assassin's Creed stealth with Batman Arkham combat, or you want some more Tolkien in your diet (though hardcore LOTR/Silmarillion fans might not like it, as it isn't the most faithful to the lore)

If you want to save some money and get the same game, go with Shadow of War. You are not missing a whole lot story wise, and the first 10 minutes of Shadow recap all of Mordor... Shadow of War also has much better boss battles, world design, and upgrades the nemesis system that controls the Uruk AI.

Lets start with the good ones. Story and characters are descent, nothing to speak about in gaming circles, but engaging enough to kept me going to the end. Combat, when it works as you expect (more on that in ""the bad"" part) is quite fun. Nemesis system is... just ok. It's a nice gimmick (with some serious side effects), but it didn't impress me as much as I would have liked.

No the bad...
The game treats your inputs as suggestions and sometimes simply makes your character do unexpected things. This is present in combat, of course, when you want to attack a specific enemy but instead you suddenly attacking another one. But the combat part surprisingly is not the worst example of that behavior. It's most infuriating when you try to catch a running captain. Instead of running in a straight line after him, you often suddenly start to climb a nearby ruins and you have to scramble to either climb it fast or drop down and run again. I don't even know how many times a captain managed to escape my grasp because of that. And while we are on that subject: captains are the worst. It's bad enough that they spout nonsense whenever you get close to or attack them, the often do that in the middle of a sword swing. You are ready to perform an execution and suddenly a cinematic starts and takes you out of the fight for a few boring seconds. And then the game shows another one, and another one, and another one. Why, you ask? Because more captains joined the fight and everyone has something stupid to say. And unfortunately, what I described here is not a rare thing.

I only finished the game because I was somewhat interested in the story and I usually finish games that I start. But it was not a fun experience for me. I guess that makes me a masochist :) . If your are not one, don't play this title."

I haven´t had the time to play it in the last couple of years, but now that I finally had a bit of time, I was finally happy to get into this. And I was utterly disappointed, because I wasted 9 hours on this piece of shit game. 

To anyone who played any Batman: Arkham game, you already know what this game´s mechanics are going to be, because it´s basically a reskinned Batman: Arkham game. You don´t even have to play this, just play Batman: Arkham City for an hour, then read the synopsis of this game´s plot, and you won´t have to fucking do nothing. At least Arkham games didn´t force you to follow people and gave you some sort of freedom, but everytime I enter a story mission, IT´S JUST FOLLOWING SOME DAMN NPC THAT WALKS FASTER THAN ME, BUT CAN´T RUN. Upgrades are somewhat interesting, but fuck me it´s the same mechanics that every fucking open-world game ever has. Stealth fucking sucks, and it´s so fragile that playing stealth mandatory missions is a fucking draconian punishment, because orcs and uruks keep pouring out of every damn spot as soon as you shoot one of them with an arrow.

The fact that they fucking casted Troy Baker to voice the main protagonist is a spit in the face of all gamers, because that man has been in every fucking game ever (YES, INCLUDING SILENT HILL HD COLLECTION WHICH WAS HILLARIOUSLY BAD). However, in this game, Troy stopped giving a single shit, because Talon is just so fucking disintered in whatever the fuck is happening around him. There is no emotion in his voice, it´s monotone, stiff, nothing really sticks, and it doesn´t fit the character. Alastair Duncan did an amazing job dubbing the Wraith, and he was the only reason I forced myself to play this game for 9 excruciating hours.

The story is really shallow and bland. I can´t even fucking remember what was happening during the 9 hours I´ve played, besides the opening sequence. I mean for fuck´s sake, I could have re-watched the entire LotR trilogy instead of playing this, and still I wouldn´t be finished with it, unlike this game, which I´m totally done with, because I refuse to play anymore of this garbage.

2/10. If it wasn´t for the good movement and fighting system that was lifted straight out of Batman: Arkham games, then I´d get a fucking zero from me."

[b]Cons:[/b]

- boring, unlikeable and one dimensional protagonist with personality of a wet noodle,

- 2 maps where everything looks almost the same. First one is muddy, other one is green (and both were reused in DLCs) and you won't care about exploring any of them because there is just nothing to explore. Flower here, caragor there and 100000 orcs everywhere,

- almost all main missions are about doing the exact same thing you already did in free roam but with cutscenes. A lot of them (hunting with Torvin or stuff with Hirgon) felt like side mission material and not something important or meaningful enough to label as story mission,

- very weak writing when it comes to characters and actual story, it's hard to care about anyone or anything that is happening,

- combat is just a worse and less smooth version of Batman Arkham series combat,

- clunky movement,

- no difficulty settings,

- lack of real boss fights. I think there are only two ""bosses"" in main campaign. One is QTE event and another is about sneaking to him 4 or 5 times,

- Gollum is heavily underused and serves almost no purpose,

- endless waves of orcs who appear out of nowhere. You're fighting three dudes? Well, here is 50 more orcs and 10 captains to make it more tedious,

- lack of mission variety. In main game I needed to kill 5 warchiefs and then brand another 5 of them.Main objective in Lord of the hunt DLC? Kill 5 warchiefs. Bright Lord DLC? Yup, you guessed it - brand 5 warchiefs.

[b]Pros:[/b]

- uhh...orcs are funny?

- The Tower has really cool design

- game is short so that's good when you're not having fun just like I did.

I realize there is a control utility but it's not like having a cheat sheet.  The game appears to involve a lot of killing and fetching without much story.  Since I've died, a lot, I've had to endure a lot of Orc trash talk.  Let's face it.  Orc wit is not nearly as witty as the Orcs think it is.  It has wasted a significant amount of my play time.  Things like Last Chance drive me nuts.  I know I'm either coming out on the short end of random number selection or not hitting the right key at the right time but too often it seems like I succeed or fail by doing exactly the same thing.  I hope it's really random numbers.  Combat is too convoluted on the PC, at least for players with only two hands and ten fingers.  The large number of triad chords with a 9 fret reach  is, shall we say, challenging.   Oh, no quick save.  Mission failure means you're returned to an arbitrary point that sometimes requires a tedious recapitulation of the 10 minutes of success you had on the previous iteration.  

The good part is that the artwork is fun.  I like the Orcs.  There's a lot of morphological diversity in the Orcish community."

757,3,0.6462,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Positives:
1. This is the first game I've played with this combat system, and it's truly amazing. I find it to be the funnest combat system I've ever used. It also is the most manageable for being able to take on large groups of enemies in a movie-style fashion.
2. The game difficulty is balanced well. It gets easier with time as your character accumulates upgrades. When I first started, I died a couple of times, but as I earned new abilities and got the hang of what's going on, it got easier to avoid dying. I think I died 4 or 5 times from the beginning of the game until the end.
3. The graphics are excellent. By this, I mean the movement and the actual image quality are both good. I have a GTX 1080ti, an Intel 4770, 1440p (2K) monitor, and 32GB of RAM. On all ultra settings with the HD textures update, my FPS ranges from 80 to 180.
4. The game can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. I was able to complete the main story line while collecting all the powers in under 30 hours. Since then, I've just been completing side missions and fighting orcs for fun. There's good replayability, due to the constant spawning of side missions where you can challenge or help orc captains.
5. The Nemesis system is pretty cool, and it adds some realism to the game. The orc captains that you've battled previously remember you, and they remember the outcome of the previous encounter.

Negatives, which is why I don't recommend the game:
1. Middle Earth isn't known for it's women wearing too little, but 1 or 2 characters were like this. This isn't necessary. It's provocative clothing for no good reason.
2. The orcs have pretty bad language, though there's not a ton of it: D**n, B****rd, (shrauk replaces s**t)
3. The orc blood is unnecessarily and unrealistically excessive. It's considerably more than what's seen in the movies (except it's comparable to the R-rated Battle of Five Armies extended edition).
4. Occasionally, you'll encounter an orc urinating, though you are spared seeing any body parts.
5. The entire premise of the game story line is getting revenge. This is an immoral motive to do something, even if the goal being achieved is good (hindering evil).
6. It's like your main character is possessed by or at least spiritually partnered with a wraith elf. It's akin to demon possession.

Other notes:
The story is considerably darker in nature than the Lord of the Rings tales, at least in presentation. My sensibilities were pretty uncomfortable, and I just felt uneasy during some of the cut scenes.

Frankly, the way the game plays is very recommendable. The combat system is particularly a standout feature. The environments are well created and there is some beautiful scenery. But the darkness and vulgarity of the game prevent me from recommending it as a whole."

By the way, I do like the game a lot, in fact I would put it in my top 10 I just really don't recommend it to others, I wish there was a ""Mixed."" or ""Okay."" option.

Now the game starts off extremely well, the motive for the protagonist wanting to get revenge isn't the best or most creative thing but it is satisfying when you [spoiler] Kill the Hammer and Tower and the sad music can tug on your heart strings [/spoiler] the idea of the respawn system being explained by being banished from death is really cool, after awhile it loses affect however.

The combat is similar to that of batman and assassins creed albeit more simple and button mashy,the finishers however can be extremely satisfying for enemies that pester you a lot like warchiefs or OP captains but I have no glaring issues with the combat system nonetheless, it's not extremely unique but it isn't terrible either.

Now the most intresting part and most unique thing is by far the nemesis system, as you die orcs get more powerful and rise up the ranks, cool right? Until you unlock the third skill tree onward (or just something like the upgrade that gives your sword unlimited executions for 20 seconds) the game becomes a breeze and the orcs that once were like minibosses in hordes become nothing but ""Hit me/block until you have enough to kill the more powerful captain or defender/berseker with an execution!"" and thus you never have to worry about OP orcs because they never exist due to your powers.

Oh and yeah, before you get good skills you're pretty screwed as the orcs are like bosses in their own right,the only reason I may have found the game so fun when I first got it on console is BECAUSE of that reason, all my rivals were able to become strong and become fun,powerful enemies while I suffered (which I may or may not have done on purpose.)

Now the story section will be spoilered to avoid anything touchy with the story, so do be warned.

Now the story starts out pretty good, infact the general beginning of the game is amazing and the atmosphere is set really well, the barren rainy wasteland that is Udun is awesome, for about 3 seconds until you realise, ""Wait it's all ruins, orc tents and slave areas?"" and [spoiler] Nurn does not make it any better by adding a bit of grass,white rocks and some water. (Although I did like the corsair theme Nurn had.) [/spoiler].
now however after you get past that fact the story starts to improve somewhat,You meet the Outcasts of Udun and their leader, Hirgon who is pretty likeable and it's nice being able to fight with humans and not [spoiler] Tamed Beasts or Orcs,(Not that those are bad things to fight with, I just liked the humans) [/spoiler] that is...until you beat [spoiler] The Hammer [/spoiler], at which point the story kind of descends into madness.

Ok ok, so you meet the [spoiler] Tribesmen of Nurn,who are basically the outcasts but better and have helmets,now I really enjoyed that their Queen was possessed by Saruman, who makes a little cameo which is neat however I didn't like that their fate was left unknown, at least the outcasts had a known fate but the tribesmen we don't really have a completely clear answer however most will presume they escaped on a boat to somewhere like Harad or Umbar. [/spoiler] Ok now you are ready to get your revenge with your [spoiler] Dominated Orcs [/spoiler] against the black captains, sounds fun to finally avenge Talion's Family, right?
Well... [spoiler] so at first you get to fight your nemesis with your warchiefs, not too bad right? then however when you confront what you think is the Black Hand, you find the Tower and while this isn't bad entirely, The Tower's boss is lame, it's using your already well developed easy to do stealth for 4 or 5 hits until you have to confront him in a quicktime, which it ends off quite nicely actually with a satisfying finisher. [/spoiler],now if you thought that was bad...[spoiler] So when you return there is lore stuff but what i'm more intrested to talk about is the horrendous final moments of this game, you storm the Black Gate which is more orc killing which gets boring fast after you unlock powerful stuff, however the real meat I want to talk about is the Black Hand's ""Boss."" so first of all you don't even get to HIT him, it's all quicktimes that at first might sound nice but the finishers were not fun for me and by far the worst part of the game was this moment and I nearly force quit because I was that bored,thank god it was only a few seconds of quicktimes and not a whole minute of that garbage excuse for ""Revenge."" such a shame to see such a good idea go to waste with a horrible anti climatic ending. [/spoiler]

Now for some points I thought didn't deserve their own paragraph and a general TL:DR or summary.

Music: 8/10, Heard better but was on the good side of the scale, they use at good points in the game.
Story: 9/10, The part that kept me playing and generally I enjoyed, Characters were fun and kept me intrested in actually beating the game and persisting.
World/Graphics: 7/10, For a 2014 game,holds up very well and still looks amazing.
Combat: 6/10, Nothing too impressive but not terrible.
Price and Specs Needed: 8/10, Not too demanding and the price is fair.
Ending: 4/10, By far the worst part of the game, I hated it so much.
Overall Score: 42/60
Would I reccommend to normal gamers?
No, unless you like hack and slash, are happy with being tortured by orcs at first,are a very boring person and don't mind the constant repeats or you are a hardcore LoTR fan, don't get it unless you know you will play it fully, there is a very clear barrier between who won't and who will like this game.
If anything, at least finish it off and give the next game, Shadow of War a go, it's much much better and improves a lot on where the first game flawed.

In all honesty, this game to me is at the bottom of the list. 

From a completionist's perspective it is abysmally difficult, and from a regular player's perspective (once I gave up on the completionist mentality) retrospectively it did not hold much value to me. While I recognize the love and passion put into this game (as one who read Lord of the Rings) I found the story compelling, but the gameplay quite droll. If you're buying this for the combat, you may be disappointed, as it is quite repetitive and struggles to hold up to the standards of well-versed hack and slash fans. Rather, this game tends to be more semi-QTE than hack and slash, with a constant need for counters when swarmed by the rather common 10-15 enemies you'll find yourself against. 

Even more so, if you find yourself struggling with the difficulty (again, as a player of DMC3) there is no REAL adjustment to the difficulty and the game penalizes you heavily for mistakes, going as far as to make it harder actually. This game is only for hardcore hack and slash fans, but even then, you may find yourself left wanting.

The combat is easy (almost impossible to die in) either make enemies much quicker to kill, or just put less orcs in each fight.

The main problem was just the boring mission design. Plenty of games can boil down to ""go here, kill this/interact with this"", but the incredibly bland map/camp layout + meh story makes even the main missions a bore.

The nemesis system is not explained super well, but it was a cool concept. Overall it didn't really work for me due to how easy it is to just not die to orcs, thus meaning they never level up. Also the weakness system was annoying as it could straight up makes some orc immune to execution moves, which is the quickest way I found to chew through their health.

772,3,0.4311,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Quick summary: I really wanted to like this game, it's not completely terrible but not good enough that I'm going to finish it when I could spend that time playing better games.  Controls are bad and gameplay isn't interesting enough to make up for it.

The main problem is that the character will frequently not do what you want them to do.  The gameplay is basically Batman Arkham combat with Assassin's Creed climbing but it makes their problems worse by combining them.  There are more enemies in melee combat than you'll usually get in the Arkham games and this often takes place around ruined buildings, so your character will often attack a different target than the one you want and then perch on a tiny wall unable to jump off while getting attacked.  This is made worse by game mechanics that rely on running around while in combat: to recover health you need to find plants (which are often right next to a wall) and some enemy leaders will run away while their guards keep fighting.  I found that the character did something different to what I wanted about every 5 seconds in combat and every 10-20 seconds while climbing, which was far too frustrating to push through.

What made it worse is that the missions aren't very interesting - you'll kill a bunch of orcs and maybe a couple of different animals (both in the main missions and the grindy side missions).  The Nemesis system is a great Idea (orcs level up when they kill you and fight for superiority with other orcs), but the game relies on that too heavily and it's not enough to make the identical missions any more interesting.  The game runs smoothly but from what I've played there's also very little variety in scenery (which is something that adds interest to even the most boring AC games).

If you really want to play a LOTR game and find this really cheap then it's worth giving this a try because lots of other people have played this and enjoy it, but I wouldn't recommend this over any of the AC games or most of the Akrham games (Asylum, City and Knight are great but Origins is one of the few games along with this one that I couldn't force myself to finish)."

This game is not bad, it's just not as great as most people claim it to be.

However, [b]""did you enjoy Assassin's Creed?"",[/b] but wish there were more Orcs, Elves, and Rings involved? If so, this is your game. I will say that the voice acting is actually quite superb. When it comes to atmosphere, the visuals and audio (soundtrack, ambient, and voice) are expertly crafted and they make it easy to feel immersed in your surroundings. The Nemesis system creates numerous engaging enemies, some of whom show up at the absolute worst times (this remains a Pro since it keeps the game interesting).

[b]Combat and action.[/b] The combat system is incredibly smooth and fluid, no bugs, glitches or stuttering - thanks to good optimization. The downside is that you are just smashing 1-2 buttons and win in most cases (99%). A [b]deeper more interesting combat[/b] system would have solved this, but they opted for the “lots of enemies” approach. This is not as fun. There comes a point where you either:
[list]
[*]just run away (because you’re bored of fighting),
[*]you just keep going despite being bored and slightly disliking the game because of it,
[*]or you eventually make a couple mistakes and find yourself dead because you’ve been fighting non-stop for an hour and you’re fingers are just done.
[/list]
I would have preferred fewer but smarter/better enemies that you interact with through a more robust combat system.

[b]Nemesis System.[/b] Ah the much vaunted nemesis system. To be honest it’s pretty cool, I’m really glad they made this and I hope to see it used to better effect in other games. It’s something that would make a great background system to a living dynamic world, but the way it’s implemented in SOM just leaves me wanting. The respawn mechanic is bad, again this is likely due to combat being shallow. A game in which death is more likely, like Dark Souls, a nemesis system would be amazing. But you really miss out on the bulk of the nemesis system if you’re “too good”. Part of the problem here is that the combat is too easy and their only solution was to throw dozens upon dozens upon dozens of mobs at you.

Shadow of Mordor is not a bad game at first moment, it's even fun until you reach that hours mark when you realize ""I have been doing same thing over and over"" After that, it becomes a burden - at least for me because I couldn't finish it since my experience was bad with it. The game disappoints because of the potential you can see in it. It's perpetually on the cusp of greatness, but whether due to time, money, or design decisions (or some combination of the above) it feels like they made it decent enough and then said, ""Yeah, pretty good, done."" So it has a bittersweet aftertaste. Lastly, I feel like this is because it was made for console. Very few console port games are fun. Console games are just dumb-downed because of the controller sake if we are being honest. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against console players, I just think the gaming industry is looking at them like bunch of credit card monkeys."

786,3,0.4434,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Never being exactly a fan of the fantasy genre, Tolkien was still one of my favorite childhood writers. His books were turned into decent games before (Battle for the Middle-Earth I & II), and Shadow of Mordor has generally positive reviews, so I was looking forward to playing this game.
Obviously, the first thing to struck my eyes were the graphics. For a game from 2014 it still looks beautiful, especially if you download the official HD texture pack.
The story starts very fast, you are kind of thrown into the open world after few cutscenes. In the beginning when you basically have to follow the story missions, the pacing is fine. But as soon as you are given more freedom, the structure of the game is revealed to be very straightforward. You can continue to follow story missions, but that´s not always possible because some tasks not related to the story have to be completed in the world before you can continue the story. The story thus feels more like a reward for grinding non-story stuff. Also the story, while non-canon, has it´s moments and with some suspension of disbelief it can be interesting to follow. But the problem is the presentation: either short in-engine dialogue between characters, or even shorter (but superior in quality) pre-rendered cutscenes of flashbacks of the main character. Due to how sparse they are, the story feels very disconnected from the world itself.
You need to conquer sectors of Mordor by defeating Orc Warchiefs. In the beginning it´s fun thanks to the ""Nemesis system"" that´s basically glorified dialogue with Orcs ""remembering"" being defeated by you or killing you, and then talking about these events every time you meet them. The games has a rogue-liteish element in that every time you die, the time advances, Orc disputes are resolved, dead Warchiefs are replaced and new ones are promoted. Also the Orc who kills you gains reputation, is promoted to Warchief and grows stronger for the next encounter. When you defeat an Orc, he can survive the encounter by cheating death or by running away before you finish him, often gaining a new ability and/or a new weakness in the process. If he survives the encounter, he can become your ""Nemesis"" who stakes it on his personal pride to kill you. The Orc occupying this role can pop out at unexpected moments to try his shot at killing you, which can lead to semi-random unscripted events in the open world that can alter how certain missions play out.
Sounds fun, right? Yes, until you realize this system has one fatal flaw. You need to die from time to time for the system to actually function as intended. If you don´t, dead Warchiefs don´t get replaced, the Orcs do not level up in power and your relationship to your Nemesis doesn´t get updated. Sure, killing your Nemesis over and over again only to have him cheat death five times is kind of funny. But in my playthrough even the strongest Nemesis stayed dead after killing him about five times, and the fun stopped there. I understood I should die to keep the flow but I just didn´t feel like doing it willingly, it didn´t feel right to need to ""help"" the game to function properly. It also shows how easy the game is. Sure, in the beginning, when your character is not upgraded, it´s easy to die, but that doesn´t mean the game is hard - it´s rather cheesy because you either get outnumbered and swarmed or you fail a quick time event. But with a little experience, it´s easy to avoid these situations.
The mentioned upgrading of the character is also without any depth, because all of the upgrades can be purchased in one playthrough - so no strategy here. The only strategy comes when equipping weapons with runes to add different effects to them, because rune slots are limited. You get runes as random drops by killing Warchiefs, best ones being dropped only by the Warchiefs with highest levels of power. And they get promoted into these high-ranked power positions when - yes, you guessed right - you die. So upgrading weapons is grindy AND requires you to die.
There´s kind of ""multiplayer"" in form of possibility to take revenge on a specific Warchief who killed some other player. Again sounds like fun until you realize that these Vendetta missions take always place at one of the very few specific locations. So the tactic to approach these fights is always very similar and the diversity comes only from the abilities or weaknesses of the Warchief. But it doesn´t really matter because the servers that enable this feature (and also the ability to transfer your Nemesis into the sequel - Shadow of War) are going to shut down with the end of the year anyway.
So the basic problem of the game is the mechanic that was it´s selling point. Add to that bland storytelling of a disconnected story, very bare bones gameplay reminiscent of Assassins Creed that consists basically of parkour and 3 moves (stealth kill with with daggers, melee combat with sword and ranged shot with bow and some variations of these moves via mentioned upgrades and a few ""magic"" abilities), and you get a game that speaks very sadly about contemporary trends in gaming."

It looks cool, the orcs are characterful and I thought the background lore was implemented decently, while taking some cool original decisions and takes on the well known world of Middle-earth. However, after a couple of hours the game becomes really quite repetitive. The combat is obviously heavily inspired by the Batman Arkham games, but it's just not as good, many times I wished I was playing a Batman Arkham game instead. Then the climbing and free-running, which is obviously heavily inspired by Assassin's Creed, but again it's just not as good. Climbing especially is at times janky and made for some frustrations. Fundamentally the core gameplay is relatively solid, but as I mentioned, the games it borrows it from do it better. 

Then my main critisicm: after the initial refreshing setting of Mordor before the events of the Lord of the Rings, the storyline becomes incredibly predictable and completely unmemorable. Characters are one-dimensional and the writing tries very hard to cram every single line uttered in the LotR films in the game, here spoken by a completely different character in a very different situation. This annoyed me a lot, if you make a game set in a pre-existing fictional world, don't just rehash what has already been written and shown but add something new, something unique. Otherwise the fictional world will feel very shallow and small, kind of like the Star Wars Sequel trilogy rehashing a lot of the original films. 

Unfortunately the lack of creative ideas doesn't stop at just the writing. The rest of the game is equally uninspired (aside from the Nemesis system which is quite fun, though that novelty too wears off after doing a very similar mission for the twentieth time). This game probably shortened my life expectancy because of the frustrations I had with it. Not because of a high difficulty but because of things not working the way they should and irritating design decisions. 

It is for these reasons that I do not recommend this game and am surprised it seems to be so well liked. I think Middle-earth deserves better and gamers deserve better, more original games."

It's certainly not a bad game, but coming out after both Arkham city and Arkham Origins, I want somethings that is its own thing; not a lesser imitation of a game from a different series. Essentially, everything this game does, Batman did better imo.

Nemesis system that everyone talks about has been null for me; since I mastered the mechanics of Batman, literally nothing can kill me here; I kill all generals and even if they try to run away, I just run after them and kill them.

There's no point in sneaking since I can take on literal hoards of enemies from the start of the game due to the exact same gameplay style.

Traversal is boiled down to holding A to climb, run etc and holding R2 to sneak, and fighting boils down to spam X until you have the opportunity to do one of 3-4 things to kill your enemy or counter some other incoming attack. Everything is really just a quick time event, your just coaxing the character into the next animation. For me this removes pretty much all fun from the game, and after the 30th shank animation things get extremely old. The bits between animations that you control are also super clumsy. The game is constantly trying to snap you to the next wall or ledge, which looks jerky and generally bad, and it can lead to you doing a lot of things you didn't mean to.

First of all, as funny as it is to slash through hordes of orcs, the hundreds of quests are so repetitive that I reached the point where playing this game felt like work. Sure, many quests are optional, but you somehow always hope  they will pay of in some way. Unfortunately, I was let down. Everything you do will just give you the option to do more of it, including playing the DLC's. 
So, what's about to say about the story? You are a ghost who buddies up with an ancient ghost. Both of you are fighting for your own revenge, which coincidentally includes killing the same enemies. It's not just a story about revenge, but also hope, betrayal, love and so on. Some twists and dialogues are so cliché it hurts. 
The ending is so bad it's insulting. You kill the final and powerful boss with Quick-Time-Events. Why are you spending so much time to improve your skills when the endboss just needs some buttons to be pressed? Of course the endboss isn't Sauron himself, it's one of his henchmen.

That last part is probably the most frustrating bit, that the enemies never stop coming. Essentially you start a fight which continuously alerts new enemies to spawn and come to the fight at about the same rate you're killing them. This takes away the satisfaction of clearing an area because you literally never can. This aspect makes stealth killing suck too, because if you stealthily kill enemies in one part of an area it doesn't take long for new enemies to spawn taking the place of the ones you just killed. very frustrating and eliminates the free space you just created to try and sneak around. Essentially every fight ends with you having to just run from the infinite horde to find a place to hide so you can plan what repetitive boss enemy you want to target next.

Graphics- Outstanding 
potential- Could be a whole lot better with a compelling story and better gaming mechanics 
Cons
Story- is not interesting
Game play- is good at times but honestly too many mistakes, too many hiccups (Assassinating wrong target) 
Difficulty- quite frankly I don't think dying every 1 to 2 hrs is fun. You are at too much of a disadvantage in horded combat. If you are fighting 20 enemies including long range you are sure to die many times. 
This game has potential but do not recommend unless you don't mind dying and getting frustrated at game mechanics

Combat sucks. Unsatisfying and boring. The way you have to kill enemies is ridiculous, hitting an unarmoured foe with your sword 5+ times before they are 'stunned' and you have to shift-click to execute them (which can be interrupted). You feel like you're fighting with a nerf bat. It is Morrowind levels of cherry tapping tedium.

'Go here, kill this guy/grab this thing' game play. Every mission is a slog. The only challenge are the infinitely respawning enemies that make it feel like you're not making any progress in the game at all and do nothing but drag out the unfun combat. 

Controls suck. This game was designed first and foremost for console. 

Baffling design choices. Every enemy captain gets a long, tedious WWE intro whenever you run into them where the game comes to a dead halt while camera zooms in on them so they can spout off some lame line of dialogue as [strike] they make their way down to the ring [/strike] enter combat, and this intro interrupts everything with no way of ignoring it. I've been killed by unblockable hits because these lame intros interrupted the parry mouse prompt. I've been in fights where 2-3 different captains run in from seemingly out of nowhere, interrupting the pace of the fight every single time. The game also tries to portray itself as a stealth open world game, but nothing you do matters and the infinitely respawning enemies (who will spawn a dozen feet away from you after you clear out an area) means after an hour you're just going to be running full bore through the small arena-like maps to get from one objective to the next as fast as possible. There's no point clearing anything out, approaching an objective stealthily from the side, etc. Just run in, starting clicking, kill/grab whatever your objective is, run out. 

The camera also sucks.

This is a shining example of everything wrong with video games. I got it on sale and I still feel ripped off."

834,3,0.5834,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Firstly, I know this is a very well-received game and I am absolutely going to get flamed for this, but please know that I started playing this game with absolutely no expectations or prior bias (In fact, I love the LOTR movies, so I was already digging the style and lore of the game). This is just my pure 100% honest opinion on what how I felt about the game.

My main issue I had with this game was in the gameplay itself. If you enjoy spamming left click and right click for hours on end with no real thought, then this might be the game for you. Or if you simply don't care for engaging gameplay and just want to mindlessly chop down orcs, then this might be fun. It really takes the genre of ""hack and slash"" to a whole new level of dullness. Stealth is an important aspect of the game, but as soon as you're discovered, you're forced to either fight a never-ending group of orcs by auto-attacking + parrying or simply run away. To me, that style of play is just not very ""fun"".

Secondly, the game really just throws you into the thick of things without much explanation of anything aside from the basic combat tutorial. After finishing the tutorial, I jumped down from the first tower only to be greeted by 3 mini-bosses. All at the same time. Needless to say, I was extremely confused and had no idea what I was supposed to do beyond that point aside from following map markers which also were not very well explained.

Lastly, you would imagine that a game that came out 6 years ago would have polished up some major gamebreaking bugs/issues, such as the mouse sensitivity not being ported properly over from console. Yes, the game was designed with controller in mind, but if you're going to port a game over to PC, at least make it playable. The camera controls felt rigid, slow, and downright sluggish when using a mouse, no matter how many settings i changed. That alone makes me not recommend it to players with mouse and keyboard in mind.

Overall, I only played 2 hours of this game. Yes that isn't a very long time, and most diehard fans would tell me that ""You haven't given it a shot"" or ""You should play more before deciding if you like it"". But it doesn't take very long to understand whether you're going to like the combat system of a game or not. Story lines and character development can change over time, but gameplay style will stay nearly the same throughout the entire game. To me, it was just too mindless and monotonous to continue playing beyond that point."

The nemesis system is interesting but the game takes too long to introduce all of its features and by that time you are powerful enough to beat any captain or warchief you want.

For those not familiar with the controversy, sections of Tolkien's fictional universe, particularly anything unique to The Silmarillion, were never actually licensed out by Tolkien or his estate - any work which expressly includes elements from them is in violation of copyright, even if they have permission to deal in all the other parts which are under the license.  Most of Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War's particular inclusions are lifted word for word out of the pages of that book, and the legal case is rather black and white in favor of the estate.

I mean everyone has their different types of fun and i can recognize that but this time i just can't, sorry but not sorry, but 91% of you are complete idiots. 

This game never works, that E.T. game that came out in 82 works better than this shit show. The developers had a revolution in their mind thinking they were Leonardo da Vinci or some dumb shit and decided to make the A button (Xbox controller, X for playstation which i used) do half of the controls so that anytime you wanted to do something it had the possibility of doing 10 other things. I mean you try to run and it climbs over an enemy. Retreat? Teleport to enemy to climb over. Run up a wall? Jump off the side and fall into a large area of enemies. Oh, this time you wanted to jump off the side?? Nah you going up the wall UNLESS, i decide that you just hang off the wall and look like a complete idiot. It's not just the A button (though the A button is the worst offender) other buttons on a controller do 2 or more things and those things sometimes contradict each other leading to terribly annoying moments, if you use a keyboard and mouse it could possibly be better, but this game doesn't feel right with a mouse and keyboard unlike other games (to me at least). Running feels like there's a pair of Logitech Z623 400® subwoofers tied to both of my tiny feet. The combat is boring with you doing the same moves over and over again whilst you sit there eyes closed while you smash X and Y and maybe sometimes A, and whenever you wanted to press Y or A to dodge/counter you always did it to wrong enemy. 

SPEAKING OF WRONG ENEMY. There is no such thing in this game known as ""a fair and fun fight"". It's like you are fighting the US Army, they will only fight you 50 to 1. You never get the chance to have a calm fight when stuff starts breaking out, there always has to be 50 goblins shits around you poking at you which makes it hard to do anything specific like countering that one guy or getting away. On top of there being so many, they just simply respawn, so there is no point in the slightest in killing them if they all if they just have Who's Who. What's worse is that whenever you go to kill a war lord/chief it's always the chief, his 2-3 op bodyguards, and 50 guys which just respawn so again there is no point in slowly killing them all so that you can get an advantage and fight a fair fight. 

As my fine man Dunkler once said, ""The characters do not stop talking in this game, ever, and damn do they have some dumbass shit to say."" Now at the beginning of the game it was cool. I liked that it zoomed in on their faces and they give a little speech on top of there being really good voice acting, it was fun. But then, then, they said the same things over, over, and over, and over, and over again. Nonstop they said the same things and each time you had to watch the 7 second cut scene of their faces. It just got really 
irritating and after a little while each time it happened i just shouted ""SHUT UP SHUT THE FUCK I DON'T CARE BUD"". It's like the joke ""That's cool and all but i didn't ask"" but this time i actually didn't. Most of the stuff the main character and supporting characters say is interesting and all but some of it is either corny ass shit or just flies right past my head, definitely not God of War 2018 dialogue. 

Both maps are quite boring in my opinion, i mean they look cool but they get repetitive real quick. Both maps are small for an open world game so much of the time missions take place not in the same place but close enough for me to be like ""Oh yeah, i've seen and been around this area like 7 times or so"". 

Story wise this game is based off of the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit which i haven't seen either, so i leave that to people like cousin Dutch who go ape shit over stuff like that. I wanna say that the reason people like this game is because it is connected to those two series and maybe people overlook the game play and other things just because it had Gollum in it but i don't think that's likely. 

All in all at the time of my furiously typing of this review after punching my worn down chair after raging at this game, i have gotten to the second to last main mission in the game and i am seriously thinking about just not finishing it, and instead looking up the ending on Youtube because i can't bear this game's shit controls and sad combat. 

Bad game."
884,3,0.7023,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I have mixed feelings about it. If you are looking for quite standard AAA experience - go for it. It's nicely done and has all standard AAA elements that will keep you playing. It can be a nice game to play from time to time just for a little escape from your life. Nemesis system (and all the ranking up among uruks) is a nice non-standard addition, but could be much more meaningful than it is. It would require a player to lose more often so the rotation among uruks is higher and I get why it is done the way it is, it just feels like a missed opportunity and a decision to play it safe.
There are a couple of problems with this game:
- story isn't as good as you would expect from a game based on Tolkien's works
- dialogues are often really bad and cringe
- combat is repetitive and easy to cheese
- missions are a bit repetitive, especially if you would want to do anything besides main story line.

I finished the game because it was nice to play it from time to time just to escape from everyday life and slay some uruks. But don't expect too much from it. Would have given mixed rating if I could, but because I had to choose, I went for non-recommendation - there are games much more worth your time."

The nemesis and combat systems are really fun, even if the game shits on the lore alot, and the story mode was engaging enough. However, I have to say, once I played Shadow of War, I could never play this game again... It really improves on so many aspects of this game and explains the story quick and to the point, so much so that I can't really give a reason to play this over SoW at all. The only reasons I could give are to experience a more detailed intro to the characters than the beginning of SoW, or to really appreciate the changes made in SoW by playing this first. If you can get this game on a heavy sale, grab the GOTY edition and you'll have some fun, but never buy this game full price. Go buy SoW instead."

- It is a pretty game
- The graphical way the main character moves and fights seems so smooth
- The maps are pretty large
- Allegedly unique damages should follow the leader uruks throughout the game (or till you kill them)
- The controls are somewhat simple and you are often reminded
- Open world

Cons:
- The game does become much ""the same""
- When you should do something simple like jump to a rope or move to a specific side from eg. a rope to a wall the main character has a really hard time understanding what to do
- Often you find yourself on a wall where he should in a pretty obvious way, but despite you want to move left he often has it by jumping up or down to the left
- when draining uruks when you are in a battle even despite there stands a group of ""unmarked"" uruks he in some odd way prefers to drain a marked uruk
- Each time you meet a leader they have to tell you a B*****DY story! And there is no way you can skip it! and sometimes you meet 2 or 3 leaders as you try to kill or mark one... You might as well have popcorn ready because wow can they speak
- sometimes, especially when in battle, it happens that he seems unresponsive
- [spoiler]The last two boss fights are complete jokes! You are not going to use any of the skills you have mastered along the way. And what's even worse is that the second last boss fight is ""harder"" than the last.[/spoiler]

The game is not new anymore, though it is still pretty. But with the cons of the game,  I cannot recommend that you get it. If you can get it really, really cheap or for free then sure what have you got to lose..."

892,3,0.4211,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","It took me a long time to get around to this and I'm wishing I didn't bother. I'm no fan of the Batman Arkham series combat systems in general, but this one is a very poor clone. Batman requires you mix up your gadgets to maintain a long combo, this one you can go for as long as enemies continue to spawn in mostly using only X and Y, and the timing is so generous you barely have to pay attention. Special mobs may require you double tap A to dodge or tap B to make them vulnerable. Woo. Challenging.
The rest of the game is shallow open world checklist completing. At any one time you are having your immersion in Middle Earth assaulted by endless popups telling you what you should be doing, what buttons to press, what you just achieved, what you are 50% of the way to achieving...
It's a shame it's so bland as they've clearly put a whole lot of effort into the game. It's fantastically polished, from the graphics, the animations, the relatively varied landscape... There's also this curious system whereby Orc chieftains vie for position amongst themselves, and as you defeat them or are defeated by them they gain ranks... I can't see why I need to care though. There's a red icon go kill it, you lose (which is not very likely unless you really aren't paying attention) go back and kill it, or go back and kill the different orc that took its place. A common fault with procedural generation, developers think it will lead to infinite gameplay possibilities whereas in reality it's questionable if there's even single playthrough possibilities worth exploring."
893,3,0.4847,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Well-polished, but mediocre. Just a cheap, mindless power fantasy sort of experience supposedly, but to me it just felt like a routine after a pretty short while.

The revenge system is a good concept in principle, but in practice you should be able to reliably defeat all orc leaders on your first encounter once you get familiar with all the mechanics. This means that the whole system decays to just a series of randomly-generated orcs that you'll quickly dispatch and forget about.

The combat is basically ""press X to win"". Sometimes it's Y, sometimes it's LT+X etc, but there's a button or superpower for pretty much anything: melee, counters, long-range sniping, attracting/distracting foes, environmental hazards, taming wild beasts etc. Some of these you get access to as you progress through the main questline, but even basic archery is overpowered, everything else is just on top of that.

Trying to excel at combat is unrewarding - the game is trying very hard to make you feel like a badass no matter how badly you play, and all you get for trying to excel is a few lame multiplier and/or damage bonuses.

Having to listen to orcs grunting, growling, shouting and posturing also got pretty drab and dull pretty quickly. They growl when they get promoted, they shout at you when they notice you, they posture against each other during power struggles and they're generally just plain obnoxious.

Also, screw collectibles, it's just pointless padding: look at map, go there, pick up random item, repeat. Omg wow, such experience! /s Their only saving grace is that some of these are used to deliver bits of lore, if one cares about the deep lore behind a pair of bland main characters killing lots of cookie-cutter orcs.

Talking about padding, get ready to enjoy the thrilling experience of hunting: X spiders (not giant monster spiders or anything, just literal spiders that you can walk over), X rats, X flying creatures etc. There are a few boss-level monsters toward the end of the hunting missions, which you get to fight during the main questline anyway, so again, just padding.

One thing I liked though: wraith vision is not as overpowered as Batman's detective vision, so that's something future games can learn from."

Buggy as fuck, like one mission I keep winning but never is good enough for the system which is farkin annoying, I keep beating it but shows no status change (poisoning the grog for the uruks or whatever they are called). I waited a number of years bc of bad reviews and price for good reason, great potential but this is the most annoying game I have ever played of all time with the most potential.

Do not buy this game. Many hours afterwards I am trying to see if this is not some worthless enterprise. But several times I find myself trapped inside the walls of many fortifications without any chance of moving, escaping, or defending, and there is still no update on the poison the grog mission…what in the actual (f***) were you thinking my esteemed game designers?

895,3,0.5781,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","First of all, the game looks stunning. Since launch and holds up pretty well. Playing it at max settings at 1080p (even though it's 2020) was beautiful. Combat was excellent even though it was getting a bit boring at the end, however, since the game is relatively short (I beat it in around 8hours with around 1h being afk for breaks on my playtime and settings etc) you can't see much of that. The idea of fighting the chiefs and them having weaknesses and getting stronger is great fun, very interesting.

The names and appearances are all varied and the areas are very detailed, even though a bit repetitive at some point. 

I'm saying a lot of good positive things about this game, but why I do not recommend it you may ask? Three simple words: Quick Time Events. 

Throughout the game QTEs are present, but they're very simply so you can survive the fight for longer and for just a bit more actions. No big deal. 

But the least boss is a 4 buttons QTE section who lasts maybe 15 seconds. Some much for a big finale, or a big boss, it's plain and simple just a borefest. I would even say that the ending is all simplified, rushed and boring. You grinded all those hours to finish the game in style with everything maxed out? Don't bother, you won't need it. 

SPOILERS HERE




You fight the Hammer mid game and it makes sense, but it's a completely easy fight (bare in mind I was playing on the hardest difficulty). Then you reach the tower, big thing for the tower and you just have to use your wraith vision to check him through the wall and stealth absorb him. 0 interest and you can finish that section in 1 minute. But again, the biggest offense is that ending fight, which is not a fight, it's a QTE section! Did I tell you how much I hate it?

So, no, I will not recommend this game AT ALL. Was going to finish it 100% because I was enjoying it, but honestly, i'm going to just unninstall the game and never look at it again by how much I hated that ending..."

And I play with keyboard and mouse, that should be impossible to mess up, but looks like that they manage to do it. Took me over an hour to get even playable setting (everything almost to slowest setting). And even on those it feels like that game changed even those settings constantly?! Even against only one enemy. After the battle is over mouse camera swirls like you are on a hurricane!? How on earth this could have passed beta stage and R/D!?

Examples:
1. If you manage to stumble your opponent to ground, and try to ground execute him (with ALT) and if he happened NOT to stumble right in front of you, game instead: A. starts sneaking B. switch to ghost arow mode. and if you do it cautiously enough (3-5 tries) so you cerrtainly point to grounded enemy, every time (if theres more than one enemy, and usually there is) other enemy manages ALWAYS hit you to back once or twice, so you pretty much gotta flee rest of the battle to heal up) 

2. About 1/4 of the time sneaking attacks wont work. And sometimes even with ALT pressed, if you have also SHIFT pressed, it just jumps over that target.

3. Dont even think about fighting shielded enemies near anything that has climable walls! Pure suicide. As instead of jumping over your target, player character likes to climb to wall instead if you pointing even tiny amount out of your target. And as dropping out of walls is so genoiusly implemented, it easy as killing a fly enemies to kill you on the wall.

4. Above the head attacks rarely works, and needs enemies to be exactly right place, and stationary, to have even slight change to succeed.

The LoTRs setting is great, the visuals/graphics too and it is a very well optimized game for PC, but the combat is just terrible. This game has the Batman combat and even though i had fun with the two Batman games (a long time ago) and i think i could have fun playing them again, this kind of combat for this game makes NO SENSE.
 
95% of the time you can only kill the enemies by doing a killing animation (i'm talking about killing, fighting, with a SWORD) by pressing two buttons together. You character uses a SWORD but instead of the sword to be able to slash enemies, it feels like the sword is made of WOOD because it feels like you are slapping or punching the enemies. And then you have the killing animation (with the sword) that takes 3 seconds to complete but if there are other enemies around, you gonna have to stop the animation to counter them, which ruins the flow of the combat. You can kill with one hit/one shot by using the BOW and the DAGGER, but ARROWS are not infinite and being forced to play the entire game by using the bow or only in stealth mode sucks. I know it makes sense for the character to go stealthly since the place is very dangerous, but it sucks to be kinda forced to kill enemies by using only the dagger. Also, if you get spotted, the game makes 15 to 20 ORCS appear out of nowhere and it becomes a mess to deal with them.

Combat system - it is quite fun to go around and feel like a badass killing everyone you encounter or go straitght into strongholds and have a 20 minute brawl with the warchief and captains and the endess flodding hordes, though it is quite easy. The game is not hard, unless you never level up HP, but even then, everything can be cheesed.
World - It is nice to go around and do some miniobjectives here and there and overall have the ability to roam. The objective system was pretty much copied from Assassins Creed though, even the falling from high towers looks the same.. 
Abilities - Some abilities are fun to use, like the branding or the poisoning of grog 
Gollum - got the original voice :) <3
Dialogues/ voice acting - at least some of the dialogues and the voice acting of the wraith is pretty nice, mostly the latter probably tho
Captain/Warchief system - it feels kind of alive, you have active power struggles of captains and warchiefs, some get replaced, some duel each other etc, and you can intervene or even infiltrate the ranks. That is pretty fun. Especially when you have like all of the captains under your command or make 5 captains fight against one warchief and stuff like that. Could imagine myself going back to the game in the future just for this kind of stuff and the combat, have a little action. :)

Negatives:
Lore - don't take any of the stories as lore, e.g. Celebrimbor having a family or helping to create the one ring. The actual story is also fanfiction, which is ok, but please don't get the lore wrong x(
CONTROLS - my biggest minus for the game. it is just so incredibly frustrating to ""run"" up a wall only to find that the character is not 180 degrees to the wall so he doesn't jump on the ledge and just falls down, or have invisible walls near the edge of a cliff when walking against it due to inaccurate mapping, or sprinting through a gate and suddenly the char runs up the wall instead... Even after 30 hours of playing I had many such moments and someitmes had to restart the mission due to that. Gotta be very careful and slow with moving around. Also the controller button mapping was sometimes not that great to use in combat, 4 skills are mapped to 2 buttons at the same time, which doesnt always get recognized, as the indiviual buttons also have different combat actions. 
Story - it is bland, the protagonist not really likable and overall too linear.
Bosses - Except for the first big boss all the boss fights are really boring. Especially the last boss was a huge disappointment -> consisted only of a few quick time events !! what a dumb way to end the game. :(

937,4,0.6135,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","TL;DR A solid game, ruined by a gigantic bug/design flaw.

This is a game similar to Mad Max or Batman Arkham games, in a sense that you have over-the-shoulder camera and you run around fighting people.
But also in the sense how the fighting is done:
Once to hit an enemy enough, it becomes “stunned” which gives you a couple of seconds to kill it. Otherwise, it may take a really long time to kill just by regular flows.
But while in Mad Max and Batman it’s implemented well.
In this game, this mechanic has a bug/design flaw.
Let’s say you’re fighting 2 enemies at once (usually it’s much more). You punch one of them until he’s stunned.
Now if you turn your attention to the other enemy, the stunned enemy will wake up and attack you, and you will enter an (almost) endless loop of punching one enemy while the other recovers, and switching enemies. Until you eventually kill them simply by punching enough which will take A LOT of time.
This is why in Mad Max or Batman, you would then perform a “finishing move” on a stunned enemy, then “stun” the other one and finish him off. All-in-all, killing 2 simple enemies should take less than a minute.
Unfortunately, due to a fatal bug/design flaw in this game, this is not the case. In Shadow of Mordor, if you try to execute a “finishing move” on a stunned enemy, the other enemy will simply attack you, interrupting the “finishing move” and forcing you to fight 2 enemies again. In other games, you’re either invulnerable while finishing off people, or do it fast enough so that other enemies can’t attack before you finish him off.
But due to the fatal design flaw in this game, you are simply unable to dispense quickly even with 2 enemies, which causes an endless grind of pointless battles even with the easiest enemies. Which also draws even more enemies and makes the battles too long, or even endless and impossible to win.

In the mid-to-late game, you gain various upgrades that allow you to circumvent the main bug of the game, for example, instant finishes that don’t require the enemy to be stunned.
However it requires quite some time playing the game to even reach that point, and I’m not sure many people have the patience for that.
I myself was forced to resort to using cheats/trainers to be able to play the game normally, otherwise, I would have abandoned it long before finishing it.

I think some game developers simply forgot the purpose of computer games.
The purpose of games is not to gain achievements or points, not to be challenging or even tell a story. The purpose is entertainment. The purpose is for the player to have fun.
If there is a good story in the game, it’s meant to entertain the player.
If the game is challenging or have achievements, it’s meant to make the game fun.
Having to endlessly fight enemies without the proper ability to kill them is not fun. As simple as that.
If your game is not fun for your players, you’re defeating the purpose of the game. It’s not a game anymore, it’s a job.

Other than that, the game is everything other people wrote.
It has good graphics, it has an upgrade tree, main quest, side quests, nemesis system, etc. etc.
All of that is good.
But the one HUGE bug/design flaw simply ruins the game.

Unfortunately, even considering all the good things, this game only gets 5/10."

If i had to compare this game to fortnite, fortnite whold've won my heart, but not this ploughing garbage"
942,3,0.3611,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I finally got around to playing this game and REALLY wanted to like it. Sadly, I was disappointed. The concept is awesome and the majority of the game seems well made. It is well optimized and runs smoothly with my aging 980ti, I used the Flawless Widescreen application to get it running with my 21:9 ultrawide monitor.

The voice acting, sound effects, etc are all great. It really is presented well and the story seems cool too, sort of that classic Max Payne style ""he took everything from me so I'm gonna kill everyone in my path to revenge"" type of gameplay. Coupled with an open world, I was enthusiastic about getting to exploring.

Combat mechanics:
The let downs were two simple but major things which killed the entire game for me. Some genius decided that drawing/aiming the bow should be bound to the exact same command as countering an enemy melee strike. This makes combat incredibly frustrating because if you press counter too soon and hold it just slightly too long it enters the bow mode which leaves you vulnerable to the impending melee strike. I practiced my timing some more but no matter what, I always end up going into that stupid bow mode on occasion and it ruined all the fun. Batman, Assassin's Creed and Tomb Raider all did a much better job handling this type of scenario and even Mirror's Edge Catalyst, which is a 1st person game, did a better job at handling combat with multiple enemies.

The other let down wasn't specific to combat but heavily affected it. The camera position. It is FAR too zoomed in on your character. I thought maybe I would get used to it but when you meet the enemy type that throws spears at you, it all changes...even at max sensitivity, the camera moves too sluggishly which when combined with being too far zoomed in makes it almost impossible for me to make sense of the chaos and combat becomes ridiculous.
I understand the argument ""you can't see much around you in the real world so zooming out would be cheating"" but let's be honest here, the primary concept behind the combat in this game is centered around you being swamped with enemies and going full Batman on their asses. Thus, I should be able to see more or at least have the option to choose my zoom level.

I'm an open minded guy which is why I have hundreds of games in my account, 99% of which I paid for and I've never asked for a refund. I will likely buy the next Middle-Earth game just because I have high hopes they will improve this series. (I know the next one is already out but I don't have it just yet)

EDIT: So I gave Mad Max a second chance and absolutely LOVED it. It inspired me to give this one a second chance as well. Unfortunately, the same could not be said.

Pros: So my two main gripes above have been ""resolved."" I didn't realize in my first attempt with the game that the Flawless Widescreen application I was using has options to fix some things such as the FOV. It was still slightly too zoomed in over his shoulder but when getting into combat especially, it was much further back and the camera didn't move sluggishly at all.

Mad Max had the same right click issue where you accidentally hold the button down too long and instead of blocking, he draws his gun but after lots of practice in that game I got the timing down to where that was no longer a problem here. I think it is dumb and probably just a hold-over from being a console game since those console folks have less buttons to work with.

The cons: Ultimately, I still couldn't get into it. There isn't any type of portable health from what I can tell and pressing Left Shift and watching my character NOT roll out of the way got to be very agonizing after my first death. I don't mind dying in a game if I can learn from it or something but half the time I take damage, if not more than half, it is the character not reacting to the roll key.
Speaking of dying, if you are on a missing you will pretty much have to start over from the beginning which is insanely time consuming and frustrating. I don't like repetition so when a game doesn't at least TRY to resolve repetitive stuff like this it eats away at me.
Were it a different style of game or perhaps had a better health management system then it wouldn't be so bad but as it is and coupled with the poor dodge mechanics, I was let down again.

I tried just running around practicing, exploring and doing side quest stuff but the game just doesn't attract to me as much as others did."

My cons: One of the worst games when it comes to pc controls, can't keybind like i want since 2-5 abilities are bound on one key and you must memorize the keybinds in the head like some old fighting game.

Can't adjust field of view, and you can't turn off mouse acceleration.

Sometimes the movement are smooth and very often you get stuck/character refuses to behave like you want.

There is only one small map, one with mud and next one pretty much identical to the first one but with grass on it. It feels like you are on the same map all the time for the whole campaign plus the two small ""expansions"", it includes alot of backpaddeling. 

It has terrible timed quests, endless waves of enemies spawn, bosses/captains despawn right infront of you without any transition if you are trying to run after them. 

Not allowed to go outside this ""green area"" if you have accepted a quest.

Cutscenes was pretty much the only thing that held me interested.

The graphics are a bit bland, and atmosphere is almost non existent, with me not even noticing the soundtrack at all. My main problem with the game basically is how boring the game gets pretty early on, with me getting pretty overpowered with the orcs, and the captains not offering too much difficulty, and the fact that the story is completely uninteresting doesn't help, unfortunately.

The combat mechanics is just smashing the attack button (and sometimes the block button) while your character (not you) is doing all kinds of cool moves without never getting tired. I don't feel awesome playing this. And no matter what you do, orcs will keep spawning, you can't have the feeling of ""clearing a zone"", the game just throws you boring stuff to kill infinitely.

Also, the first hour or two consisted of reading and closing millions of UI menus that pops up constantly ! Why make the advancement of your character so complex, with skills, abilities, runes, etc. if the only thing you do is hack-and-slashing orcs ??

Storywise, you are thrown into this world inside the skin of a character you don't even know, there is no ""preface"", it's just ""boom you die, then come back as a shadow/spirit/whatever""... it's just... flat.. and devoid of any feelings.

-Combat is solid, the finishes are especially slick and probably my fav thing about the game
-Stealth is done very well and I love the way you need to use it on certain missions
-The graphics were good for it's time (early 2015) and still pretty decent to look at

Cons: 

-The movement is soooooo janky, Talion may be the least graceful ranger I've ever seen.  He walks like Sauron's tower is up his butt and the platformer bits become really frustrating with the tanky style of movement.  
-The game becomes super repetitive very quickly, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you enjoy the core mechanics, but if you don't then playing it just becomes a chore after only a few hours. 
-Getting hit by ranged attacks off screen becomes super frustrating, and while they do try to give you a bit of a warning the prompt doesn't come up nearly fast or often enough.  Especially if you find yourself fighting multiple ranged units at once. 
-The story is immensely bland, which sucks because it starts off very well. 
-Seems to have a lot of issues with framerate drops during the executions.  

Overall:

I really wanted to like this game, but after about 10 hours in I just can't justify wasting my time on it anymore.  Some of the combat can be really fun, and I can def see the endgame becoming a lot better once you get all the upgrades, I'm just not willing to invest the time needed to get to that point anymore.  I may give Shadow of War a chance and see if they improved on the gameplay at all, I know a lot of people won't agree with me on this because this game is super popular but I just couldn't get into it.

The combat is fine but becomes too easy once you unlock a few abilities. The stealth is utter crap.

The game didn't need an open world, it's ugly, boring to traverse and adds absolutely nothing to the game. There is also the fact that the game repeatedly padds out its length by incredibly grindy sections.

Finally the story. I didn't like it, at first, it's really confusing but then it sort of meanders till the end culminating in a joke of a final boss and a bad cliffhanger. There is also a dwarf character, which has to be the most annoying character I have ever met in any video game, I wanted to kill myself whenever he started talking.

Do you like the Assassin's Creed games? If yes, you'll probably enjoy Shadow of Mordor. For me, I'm lukewarm on the AC series. Mostly misses with a few hits. Now imagine an AC game where you can only assassinate a few of the targets. The rest of the time you will have to kill them using the combat system. Which, is repetitive.

The big selling point of the game is the Nemesis System. And while I did enjoy the small stories between myself and my orc antagonists it's not enough to shoulder an entire AAA video game. 

- The main plot is gossamer thin. Shadow is 80%+ side quests, relic searching, and the stories between you and the nemesis system
- The combat is repetitive and pattern oriented: Attack x3, Counter. Rinse and repeat. Interspersed with one-trick-pony enemies
- Game starts off with the difficulty spike and then quickly plummets as you unlock abilities. Making missions more busywork than actual game play
- Way too many abilities. Sword, Dagger, Bow, Vault, Mounts, Combat Finishers, Weapon Powers, and assorted wraith powers. I think the game would actually be better if you had LESS options.

In the end the game's story didn't engage me and make me want to keep playing. That left the heavy lifting to the game play loop, which I found boring. Not where I would go to scratch an itch for LOTR or AC-style game. 

Alternative Games
- LEGO LOTR
- War for Middle Earth
- War in the North
- AC Brotherhood, Black Flag, Origins, or Odyssey

The nemesis mechanic is also a great feature which immerses you more into the world, and the enemy feels more fleshed out instead of just being a mob of orcs and uruks. However after a while the open world design feels like any other ubisoft sandbox and objectives feels like nothing more items to check off. The characters feels simple and mostly one-dimensional. 

Although the new powers and moves you learn through the game are cool and at the best times gives an great flow in combat, the enemies never keep up with anything new and you therefore become OP. The boss fights are a fucking joke, with a lot of quick time events. I thought at least that the boss would be the instances were the difficulty would be higher and therefore would require more effort and creativity with how you would need to use your powers. That was certainly not the case. 

That said, the game is not without its enjoyable moments. They were times when I was truly immersed in the battle, and had a lot of fun trying to survive a big fight with several enemy captains. All over the voice acting was also well done. Most of the cutscenes were beautiful and visually interesting. 

All in all a mediocre game with a lot of objectives and quests that simply felt like padding, with some enjoyment spread far too thin in between. I can therefore not recommend this game.

The game looks absolutely stunning, especially for a 2014 title. The soundtrack and voice acting is good. The story is pretty basic but not terrible. The gameplay is a hybrid of the two earlier franchises I just mentioned, which has it's flaws but can be enjoyable to most.
Despite all of these points the game gets dragged down heavily by one thing: the difficulty. The game is way to easy. This is coming from somebody who considers himself a casual player. While the game gives you ways to upgrade your character and gain other advantages over enemies, there's no incentive to do so since you're an untouchable god from the first minute onward, being able to handle multiple bosses at the same time if you spend 3 minutes getting used to the combat system which is a 1 on 1 copy from the Batman Arkham series. For that reason I avoided upgrading anything yet I blasted through the game regardless. Stealth is stupid and not enjoyable by how OP it is, invincibility frames are way to long, enemies take way to long with their attacks etc. All of this wouldn't be as much of a problem if you could change the difficulty, but that's not a thing.

If you enjoyed only the combat of the Arkham Batman series sure, otherwise this game offers little else, it doesn't even setup well for Shadows of War.

Mechanics
in combat rating C (its pretty meh)
If you've played Batman arkham city, this is the game you're buying just reskinned to be Lord of the Rings.
All of combat is mapped to 5 buttons the mouse and WASD to move. Combat involves two dodge buttons, an attack button, a stun, and executes. Batman gadgets are mostly gone, but for some reason i still have batarangs (wraith knives), and an OP bow of insta-death to ALL minions.
Outside combat F (Didn't try)
There is running and climbing and batmans detective vision though this has no other use then finding orks to kill, that is all. Outside of combat you'll be collecting random crap around Mordor or running to the next map marker. Oh there is also beast taming...which is combat into a single button quick time event.

Characters D (Forgetful)
Talion is flat and might as well be a silent protagonist, his dialogue often happens with the wraith, but even in other scenes he rarely if ever exceeds 2 sentences. Despite the horrible events occurring and the people he meets, he only shows any character in the last hour of gameplay, which the writers quickly dismiss from memory because of the letdown of the boss which i'll get to.
Gollum as himself being obsessive.
Wraith as the wraith being angry at orks.
Outcast leader, forgettable and unimportant
Love interest, constantly needs help and gets captured even after assisting her.
Ratbag best character in my opinion, humorous, orkish, brutal, has a quirky reason to be around talion, though talion shuns and ignores him so much. I honestly wish talion would have opened up more to him over the story, but no aloof and dismissive.
Dwarf also funny but could we have a dwarf that isn't just Gimli's personality stuck in a new body? 
Everyone is flat and you see them so rarely i somewhat question why they got such good voice actors. No one really changes or has any arc, they mostly just serve to extend the story.

Difficulty D (tried and failed)
I died once in the game, i ran through a fort like a howling moron and wound up finding 4 generals, being a howling moron i killed 2 of them before finally dying to the horde. Had i been strategic or honestly tried to not die, i could have killed all 4 without issue. If you're expecting epic boss fights do not even consider this game, bosses don't exist. The ork generals can be boiled into 3 categories. Range them to death, blow them up with your op fire powers, or stun them, Rinse Repeat. Get about 3 runes slotted into every weapon and you become god, essentially able to murder orks with impunity.

Story D (tried and failed)
Family is murdered go seek revenge because a magic soul bound to your corpse. Meet forgettable characters learn why they suffer, essentially leave them how you found them. Gain revenge on the agents of sauron because they are easier to murder then orks. Bad one line setup for game 2 ""welp guess we go finish off sauron then!""

Bosses Z (how?)
Really 1 boss, whole game you made one attempt at a boss? The Hammer he is interesting at first then you realize you just kill him like any melee ork. The TOWER is just stupid, literal tripe, you kill him with stealth and ONLY stealth, that's his fight, this is not a boss. Hand of sauron, quick time event, four clicks, yay you win the game...
Pathetic

Time D (meh)
Main story no extras probably 8 hours at most. 6 of which you're rinsing and repeating your way through ork captain killing/branding.

Extras B (good)
Lots of history and narrative (lore) hidden in the collectibles and challenges, some interesting stories laying about to really sink into...though none are terribly deep, i find the animals in the appendix most interesting.

Extra Extras (game modes and such)

For the first 15 hours I liked SoM - a lot! Then it became clear this is a grind to nowhere, were you are being constantly swarmed by 30-something orcs, if you are not really lucky enough to not blow your stealth. You just cannot kill / brand them fast enough to make a dent then and to make things worse, there are up to 4 additional Captains that can show up at once.  
Far Cry 3 liked to escalate things that way, too - you know, you shoot some one, then some more guys come, then a tiger, a bear and a hoard of boars or whatever. But it was way more fun there, than in SoM because there was an end to the onslaught.
SoM is not a case of GET GUT, it is a case of when you finally succumb to  fatique.


And Warchiefs can have up to 3 followers,which you have to take out first, or you are up against the Warchief AND his Captains AND a never ending reinforcement of minions, making the task even more tedious and drawn out, either way. On the other hand, killing Warchiefs by making their Captains betray them is way too easy. 
And this is the whole play-cycle!

Whoever thinks Ubisoft games are a map of  tedious clearing tasks has never played SoM!. In a Ubisoft game the marks at least stay cleared! Here they ARE the main game and come back again and again in always the same fashion.

1037,3,0.3789,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Possibly one of the worst games i've ever played, for my tastes. Horrible storytelling. Zero believability. Its very much a old standard video game with a LOTR story sort of pasted on. Heres a few examples:  Menus popup with ""bang"" like sound effects more often then a  Borderlands game on speed. The menus announcing side-quest tasks sometimes offer little reasons for doing them other than chasing points necessary to unlock abilities. Almost no attempts at a believable immersive game flow. For example, within 10 minutes of entering the open world, you start overhearing the orcs talking about ""the dreaded ranger guy lurking around"" (you) and its endless from there on. You're in Mordor and there are human slaves everywhere, killing orcs signals them to be free, yet when you free them they just run off and instantly get killed by the nearby Orcs that magically can't see you 30ft away. Again, almost zero attempt at a believable world: on one early mission when you poison 5 drinking reservoirs, each triggers orcs to suddenly stop what they're doing and run over to it and start drinking to be poisoned and it looks ridiculous. Missions start like this: you click on a hovering icon floating in mid air that abruptly sends a briefing window up with an in-your-face audio effect much like in a Borderlands game, then things start happening to support the mission that weren't happening seconds before you accepted the mission. The mission icons are located around the map and can be seen on the map ridiculous mini-map. The game has a mini-map...  The game has possibly the most awkward movement system i've ever used. I had no problems with Arma 2 or Styx games and i appreciate movement complexity, but this is like a badly implemented Assassin's Creed game. IE, sneaking up to something to poison something, pick up something, interact, etc, you must release crouch (aka sneak mode) first which causes you to stand and go out of sneak mode, then you can interact with whatever it is. You do this often.

One of my biggest issues with this game is that orcs behave no different than people. They're basically intelligent people, not evil things you can't reason with, but nearly people with desires and dreams and...........you basically slaughter them. In LOTR lore and D&D, orcs are portrayed as pure evil, they raid human villages for kicks and will kill almost anything on sight. We have little choice but to kill them and therefore there is no guilt attached to killing them, like zombies. Here, orcs are a people like humans so its a little weird to kill them and if they are this intelligent why should be reasoning with them. You could say the power that Suron has is ""corrupting"" them or whatever but its all still a little weird IMO. The great thing about zombies is you can mow them down  by the thousands and you haven't done anybody any wrong. You can't say the same thing here, but thats kind of the way it should be IMO for worlds where the point of them is adventuring.

If you play this for what it is, just a standard video game and you're not all that interested in story or immersion, you might like it."

I am going to start with that to be honest cause I am amazed how a game that has an open world which is smaller than my 30 square meter apartment needs 40 Gb of disk space just for orc faces. Literally the world is so small you can ride it while mounted from 1 edge to another in less than 2 minutes !!. Game can be completed in a mere 20 hours with minimal effort. Also I can't understand the hype that emerged around this game and its combat while being an assassins creed clone. The combat focuses in a technique where u pretty much you  do nothing but plenty of stuff are happening in your screen . Combat has plenty of pop ups showing you exactly what you need to press in order to win but it can be summarized as a very nice timely pressing of the right click of your mouse in order to annihilate hordes of enemies . Let me get this straight enemies will never jump on you in forces but have the kindness even in huge numbers to come at you 1 by 1 taking turns like they are in a super market line . Even if you are cornered you are actually not since never more than 1 enemy will jump at you. Also you are immortal since your death is decided by disgustingly placed quick time event , oh god I love those. The AI is retarded making the stealth section of the game a joke since you can literally walk in front of an enemy and he wont even notice you. Aiming is also a joke making a toddler with no brain function a master in the bowman arts similar to Legolas.  Game also is filled with repetitive missions and capture points trying to add on the game length with little success.  Final boss is so lazy designed resulting of being a glorified quick time event in total. I never will understand the hype over this game and the critical acclaim around it since it is one of the most sloppy easy and bland games I have ever played in my life

I only recommend playing it if you enjoy the constant grind, where your level means very little, you or a level 19 Warchief can be cheap-shot by a lowly level 9 captain, carnigor or grunt. Where the mob endless spawn out of nowhere, waste an hours on slaughtering the mindless hordes just to dominated some lousy guys, so I could get to the next lousy guys and dominate them to and so on and so forth into eternity.....

While the camera and controls continuously fight against you almost every step of the way. Trying to get your combo up on a lone grunt without the game ""helping"" you suicidally leaping back into the middle of the mob. Refusing to climb in any direction while chasing down one of the many homicidally inclined bags of snot with arms and legs decides to run just because more of its insides are outside, and that for some reason is immune to an arrow between the eyes below his bare balding forehead.

[b] The Story [/b]
Shadow of Mordor is a game based off of Lord of the Rings, a franchise I personally have never gotten into. That being said, it wasn't hard to figure out the lore behind the setting of the game. I won't spoil it, but all I will say is the story is weak. You're a typical dude on a typical quest, with very bland and lifeless characters ontop. ""Ah, I had a tragic past"" kind of 'character' arc that you are given with all the characters.

[b] The Gameplay [/b]
I'll be honest, in the first hour of playing Shadow of Mordor, I was enthralled by it's mechanics. Parrys, counters, environmental kills? All super fun and engaging! Except for the fact that that is literally what you do [b] ALL GAME [/b]
This game, by definition, is a hack n' slash game. You just killed orcs mindlessly the entire game. As you progress in the game, you make killing orcs easier or get new abilities to kill orcs, and that's the extent of fresh gameplay you'll recieve. Over the course of the game, you will learn new and fun abilities that, after an hour of using, just become stale and the same repetitive crap.

If you enjoy killing the same enemy over and over again, I recommend this game to you. You'll have no shortage of killing orcs, killing orcs, and-- also-- killing orcs.

[b] Bosses [/b]
This deserves a special category because this is why I originally wanted to write this review.
[b] The Bosses Suck Hot Ass [/b]
SPOILER WARNING:
[spoiler] You have three main antagonist bosses in the game, and they all vary. The first one is an actual fight, and is the best of the three. The second boss is a stupid sneak mini-game where you never actually find him, you just play a game of hide-n-seek except you have x-ray. The last boss... oh man... the last boss.
This is the worst last boss of ANY game I've ever played.
And you wanna know what the fight is like? [b] It's 5 quick time events [/b]
That's right, by now, you've killed thousands of orcs, and you face the final boss, and you get to press spacebar five times to ""kill him."" (Lore wise, you never actually kill him, so there's that to).
It completely ruined the game for me, and it made me feel like I played the game for nothing. I didn't feel accomplished at all through all the trials and tribulations of playing, I just felt as if my time was stolen, and I stared at the credits saying out loud ""What the fuck was that?"". [/spoiler]

If you didn't read the spoiler, I'll summarize it. Bosses are hot garbage. Worst feature of the game.

[b] Other Misc. Crap [/b]
Aside from that, there isn't much to the game. After you finish the main quest line, you can continue to hack n' slash all you like. There are a few collectibles here and there, but the only reason you would collect these is if you were a completionist, otherwise, you just press a button on a location and you get a little taste of LotR lore. I also forgot to mention the side quests available, which is, you guessed it, hacking and slashing orcs.

[b] Final Verdict [/b]
If you enjoy a good roleplaying experience, (btw this game is classified as ""RPG"". RPG my ass) this game is not for you. If you like killing orcs for hours and hours and collecting a crap ton of stuff, play this game. The story is weak, gameplay repetitive, and the bosses are just... flat out sad.

It's blessedly short compared to an Assassin's Creed, Grand Theft Auto, or the like, but there's no strong hook to latch onto.

Orc minibosses having a collection of procedurally-generated characteristics sounds neat, but ultimately most boil down to ""Don't use [x]"" when fighting them, whether [x] is your bow, stealth attacks, your counterattack, etc. That will affect how you initiate the fight - a stealth kill is a huge time-saver, baiting a wolf monster helps quite a bit, and an arrow or three will chip in in a pinch. But I found that just about everything ended up in a gigantic brawl, and you can ignore a lot of those specialties by just building up your combo meter on the mooks and cashing in your special attacks on the boss.

More critically, the system just doesn't tie into the rest of the game. There are 2 or 3 story missions that are gated off until you deal with these procgen orcs, but the rest of the game is just... regular open world-y missions of following NPCs around and doing the same things you've been doing the whole time. This all coalesces into the goofiest finale I've seen in quite some time, where your big effort to seize control of the greatest warchiefs in the orcish army culminates in, essentially, a fight in an empty parking lot.

If you want open world brawlers, stick to [i]Arkham City[/i] and similar. If you want procedural generation shenanigans, try [i]Heat Signature[/i] or any other number of roguelikes/roguelites/etc."

I had very high hopes with this game but so far I got injured pinky and frustrations. I have played many games, so I instantly realize when a game's difficulty desperately built upon input mechanics instead of story and player's choices. And yes combat mechanics have to be clunky and bugged to accomplish these. 

Example; ground execution, it's just lame. It doesn't work properly, every time you use it then the character swing his hand into the air, decide to attack another enemy or just duck. Why, because the incapacitated enemy falls to the ground and away from the player while another enemy come closer. I'm a software developer too, I don't think it's hard to write a code to decide which enemy is perfectly healthy and which is lying on his a** to wait for killing blow.

I don't hate consoles but I hate ported games, because in every ported game there is a key to rule them all and in this game it's the left shift. You want stealth press Lshift, you want a finisher press Lshift and so on and in a game like this where stealth is essential you must hold that key pressed all the time. Because why implement toggling just f*** the pinky finger right?

I still can't understand why games like these are tagged as RPG. Where is the ""role playing"", where is the choice/branching, not to mention character building. As I said I had high hopes and I was thinking to buy shadow of war too. I'm glad that I didn't rush it, just because i love LOTR."

And every third orc (or whatever) wants to say something to you via unskipable cut. Something like ""I like when you are screaming from pain, but Im not sure if you like it"" (or some another bullsiht). And of course they are still respawning untill you die. There is no end in this mass orcs (or whatever they are) genocide.

I do like the game for it's visuals, story, orcs and the nemesis system or whatever it is called. The approach they have taken when it comes to difficulty is absolute shit. I am a fan of difficulty in games, but it need to be difficulty brought by well designed enemies, not by throwing a million enemies at the player, who all do almost the same things. Every time i try to take down a captain or warchief and so forth, they somehow make all the orcs in the surrounding area gather to you, even if they do nothing to get the attention of them. Trying to isloate them is impossible. Now all of this would be acceptable if it was not for the fact that the non-special keeps spawning over and over again :(

The game world, while being set in LotR universe is utterly uninteresting and empty. The characters feel out of place when they appear at your side occasionally, because otherwise and most of the time it's just you, enemies and copypasted models of slaves on two generic maps.

Let me put it this way: You fight Orcs in this game, sometimes they interact with each other in semi-scripted manner, sometimes get slightly stronger and sometimes you bend their will, and that's it. All the other activities, map, dialogues are not worth your time. You don't even change your equipment. I suggest you just follow the main questline that expands on the story of the ringmaker and finish some side-quests along the way... do anything else and the game will overstay it's welcome.

I was impressed by this game and bought it because of all the good reviews that came from it. But all it is is a game where you go around killing Orcs. That is pretty well the main premise of this whole game. Sure the fighting is fun but there is little story beside if J.R.R Tolkein hadnt made this story into as big of a classic that it is this game would have nothing. This game only exists because of the great classic it stems from and it only narrowly carries its influence. Personally I like a deep carrying story to a game.

The game feels ... just boring. The story we get in the first few minutes is not interesting, it's not entertaining. A hero we get to play is just blend, ""I'm such a good soldier, I love my wife and son very much, I need to leave this shithole, but I kinda died"". The story does not make any sense to me, evil sorcerer curses you, and thus enable you to decimate his entire army in the area. Cool, let's just give nukes to our enemy... 
Enemy AI is a joke, you can sneak behind an entire patrol of enemies with torches, kill one after another and they won't even notice.

1115,3,0.7567,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","It's fun chopping off orc heads for a few hours but it quickly loses its appeal after you've done this for about the hundreth time.  The level design is pretty bland and somehow manages to feel empty in a way even though there are lots of enemies and structures everywhere.  There's a cameo by Gollum/Smeigel here with a convincing voice actor that sounds similar to Andy Serkis from the movies, but it's a short cameo.  Otherwise the story is a bit uninteresting throughout.  

This games shining feature though is the Nemesis system that doesn't immediately show its true worth at the start.   It shows you a heirarchy of enemy generals and grunts that you can kill/wound/manipulate in various ways to change the balance of power within their ranks for your benefit and can create unique encounters and villians specific to you and your actions.  Enemies will remember you and change up their fighting style when you face them again and some will taunt you if they've killed you before.  It took until the second level for this system to really go into full gear and it made the encounters much more interesting.

However once the novelty of the Nemesis wears off, the game becomes boring again and the ending is lackluster.  I would only recommend this game if you are a big Lord of the Rings fan, but otherwise it's just kinda average.  Hopefully the Nemesis system can find its way into better games in the future."

- Stealth: Stealth mechanics are very bad in my opinion. I can stealth kill an enemy right next to its friend (whose eyes I can see while he is looking around but of course not facing directly at me) without alerting him. I can also run close to an enemy group and it takes a long time for them to notice me (I can easily run past them and hide into a bush without being noticed). I do not remember if the Batman series has the same issue or not. Enemy notice time should be shorter and their angle of detection should match their eyes.

- In-combat cut-scenes: In the heat of a Warchief battle (also happens at forts/strongholds), your combat may be interrupted by his captain followers (depends on their number but sometimes up to 4) which spoils your concentration. Cannot be passed with ESC button.

- Enemy re-spawn rate: Enemies re-spawn very fast. During a stealth mission, an archer was re-spawned next to the one I killed in 10 seconds which gave me a hard time to complete my mission. In my opinion, it will be a good idea to limit the spawn rate to once each game session or once per character death. Otherwise it kills the realism of the game for me. I want to have the satisfaction of clearing a stronghold.

The story was weak and the characters forgettable. Not much to say about it other than that it basically just tries to give you an excuse to kill orcs in different locations. It's a revenge story. Bad guys kill your family at the beginning, are completely absent for the next few hours while you kill orcs, and make an appearance at the end again. The ending is also completely anti climatic. The final villain doesn't even get a fight, but is instead dealth with in a short cutscene with quick time events. Then a final cutscene makes it obvious that this game was written not for the sake of a satisfying story, but so that a sequel could be made.

Gameplay is fun for a few hours, think of it as Hack and Slash with some ""stealth"" elements. Though combat is complex enough to be entertaining, it is not complex enough for a game that has very little else to offer, and for that reason the game gets very repititive and feels more like a drag at the end. Stealth of course is just a fun gimmick, and is not really required unless the game tells you so. 

The world is basically made up of two open maps filled with orc camps, wild beasts and collectables. You run (or fast travel) from mission to mission, climb up watchtowers to reveal items and the like... sound familiar? 
The relatively unique Nemesis concept (different orc chiefs roam the map, rival each other, rank up when they kill you or another chief, everyone has their own strenghts and weaknesses you can find out etc etc) is pretty engaging at first, but this also feels like copy paste after you've taken out a few of them.

The Batman-esque combat system is functional, yet not exciting. Everything ultimately comes down to button mashing. Honestly, you can fare pretty well using only three buttons - attack, block, and execute.

Furthermore, Nemesis System looks good on paper, but it falls flat after you play for a couple of hours. All these ""unique"" orc personalities and traits cease to matter after you find out that most of the Captains drop like flies. Kill enough of them and the system simply runs out of elements at its disposal.

The storytelling is not worth your time, either. The main plot feels short and forgettable. I managed to 100% the main game in around 24 hours. It may seem reasonable, but once you take into account the time spent on searching pointless collectibles, saving pointless slaves in a series of simillar missions, and general faffing about, you will end up with maybe a quarter of that time dedicated to the main story. There is not even a climactic and challenging final boss that would justify all this. Out of three main antagonists, only one really fights you. The battle goes down just like a fight with a Captain, and by then you had probably fought dozens of them. The second is reduced to a simplistic stealth challenge that is almost a glorified QTE, and the final boss actually IS a QTE. The ""bad fanfiction"" quality of the story also does not help.

The DLC are boring and very easy. They don't add any meat to the game.  Would not reccomend the game unless it is under 3€ for sale."

[u]Short version[/u]
Rating: 6/10
The game is fun in the first 10-15 hours, arguably deserving a higher rating of 8/10, but it gets repetitive quickly from here on, harming the final rating. The game is too focussed on its indeed enjoyable combat system. Interesting characters, storytelling and side missions would have enriched the game and saved it from its monotony. I recommend playing Batman: Arkham Asylum and/or Batman: Arkham City instead, from which Shadow of Mordor heavily borrows its core.

[u]Long version[/u]
Before going into details, please keep these 2 things in mind:

- I am huge fan of the game Batman: Arkham City (not coincidentally also published by Warner Bros. Interactive), which is an obvious strong inspiration for Shadow of Mordor. So comparing these two games is not only very tempting, it's even a necessary question when it comes to taking the oh so hard decision of how you would like to spend your precious time and money.
- I am not a big fan of The Hobbit/The Lord of the Rings. So expect no in-depth discourse on how well this game respects its source material, which I know can indeed be an important factor to dedicated fans.


Shadow of Mordor is very much focussed on the combat system that it borrows from the Batman: Arkham Series, with my favourite being Arkham City, hence I will base my comparison on this particular game. The combat system is indeed very enjoyable and satisfying, so it's no surprise that the developer put the main focus here. Yet, Shadow of Mordor became repetitive when hitting the 50% game progression mark. Sadly, neither the story nor the characters are very interesting, including the main character, which is a shame, considering Middle Earth's rich lore that the game could have borrowed from. Batman: Arkham City on the other strikes a better balance between combat, exploration of the world, interesting storytelling and featuring an interesting cast of characters. Granted, Shadow of Mordor at least tries to include famous characters from the books/movies, but they often feel like shoved-in Tolkien fan service cameos, which comes as no surprise, as the game's story is not only paper thin, but also quite detached from the books'/movies' main events.

Both games offer motivating character development with gradually unlocking new skills and abilities, which is very satisfying, as the player can see the character become more powerful. In Shadow of Mordor, these skills are, again, all focussed on the game's combat. Batman: Arkham City's unlocked new skills on the other hand can often also be used to overcome previous obstacles in the world's landscape, motivating the player to revisit locations, which not only helps memorising the more detailed and interesting level design of Gotham, but it also makes the hunt for collectibles way more interesting.

Shadow of Mordor's collectibles are all directly accessible right from the beginning, the only exception being that necessary story progression can block the player temporarily out. The open land of Mordor is also way more accessible and free to roam right from the beginning, as 50% of the (in comparison quite simplistic) landscape is free to roam right from the beginning. Batman: Arkham City is more restricted and gradually opening up, as the player progresses in the main story -- yet, there are still a lot of very different choices of what to do.

The main character in Shadows of Mordor seems like an amalgamation of the developer's ideas of ""what character would be cool to play in Middle Earth"", so they went with a new blank-page character that is a combination of an Aragorn-inspired Ranger (even sporting a dagger that looks like a broken sword), an Elven archer (having the expected deadly accuracy), and a ghostly wraith -- all wrapped into one playable character. The background of the human main character is pretty much non-existent and can be summed up with ""typical quest for vengeance"", while the wraith's identity is at least slowly revealed. And since there was obviously no similar gadget available like Batman's ear piece that is connected to Alfred/Oracle for offering advice and commentary, I have to say that I like the decision of including an accompaning ghost in Shadow of Mordor that does the same job for the player.

Speaking about the main character's feats: It's clear and I do very much appreciate that the developer sacrificed realism for playing comfort, wanting to have a very similarly quick movement flow like Batman: Arkham City has, and yet it feels strange that the main character can climb walls and make acrobatic jumps just like Batman, which my questioning brain accepted better, since he's obviously an over-the-top comic book character with superhuman abilities, while the Middle Earth Ranger is indeed in the end almost ""just human"" and a new and unknown character in the deep lore of Middle Earth. This is a bit nit-picky, but it shows how heavily Shadow of Mordor relies on its inspiration -- but again, for gameplay's sake, I absolutely appreciate this decision and would not want to have it changed.

Shadow of Mordor is very distinct from Batman: Arkham City in one aspect that jumps very quickly into the player's face: While Batman is known for not killing his opponents, Shadow of Mordor goes in an entirely different direction, as the combat is here very bloody and gory, showing slow-motion sword-chopping decapitations in carefully curated close-up scenes. And as I mentioned in the beginning of this review that I am not a big fan of Tolkien's work, I have to say that this direction and focus on gore still surprises me when connecting it to Tolkien's universe in my head. And speaking of heads: Shadow of Mordor's degree of gore goes so far to feature exploding heads (although it is actually less graphical as it may sound).

Another big difference is the ""Nemesis"" system, featuring randomly-generated minibosses with strengths and weaknesses, while also simulating the internal power struggles of Sauron's army. While this does sound exciting in theory, the only part that is actually interesting are indeed the minibosses with their strengths and weaknesses, requiring the player to adapt in combat.

Speaking of the minibosses, the last major difference is that runes can be obtained from defeated minibosses and fitted into weapons, granting different kinds of bonuses that can support different styles of fighting, similar to other action RPGs like Diablo or Borderlands.

Overall, Shadow of Mordor is a fine game that aims to offer a very combat-focussed gameplay. So if you enjoy the fast and tactical combat system of the Batman: Arkham Series, it's definitely worth picking up. The game probably won't keep you glued to your computer like Batman: Arkham City does, but even after hitting combat fatigue in Shadow of Mordor about half-way through, it's still fun to revisit the game for a few missions, packed with gory greenskin slaughtering. I recommend getting it at a discounted price of under 20 Euro/Dollar or less though -- and also definitely giving Batman: Arkham City a closer look.

Every. Single. Time. As much I like some combats to be somewhat chaotic, the fact that EVERY fight is with 3 or more captains (who appear while you are fighting the first captain) and a literal ENDLESS horde of never ending uruk spawns ruins the experience for me. I feel like they didn't really play test this game. I also once spawned a Uruk captain that was IMMUNE TO ALL FORMS OF DAMAGE, healed quickly, did 4x damage to everything it hit, poisoned, was an archer, and just could not be touched (would be doable if not for the constant captain and uruk interferance, 1 on 1 is the only possible way to beat this captain). Great game mechanics being held back by stupid and lazy design."

It sat on my wishlist for months as I waited to build up enough my gaming fund to buy it.  In the end I wish I'd read more of the negative reviews before I pulled the trigger. As other reviewers have noted, the game itself is impressive. Good story, great graphics and  an interesting RPG system.

For all of this I still can't recommend it. The developers were either octopii or decided that the players would have eight button custom mice (or perhaps would use a steam controller that I wished I had!)  The game simply isn't much fun if you can't meet one of those options. The issue is the controls. To give an example,  early in tutorial you're asked to creep forward - This simple task requires two keys plus the mouse  - W plus L-Control AND keep your mouse pointed the right way.  That's great when things are not trying to kill you. Not so much in combat, add being a lefty and you can forget it. 

In short if you have more than the usual two arms, a programmable mouse or a cool steam controller this game is da bomb. Otherwise not so much.

1171,4,0.391,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","tl;dr: a game filled with repetitive quests, bad dialog and frustrating combat. The Middle Earth setting and lore are the only good things about this game.

At first I was enjoying myself. The music in the opening cutscenes was louder than the dialog and I had to sneak up to kiss my wife but, the game was beutiful and the combat was fluid so I kept playing. In the opening scenes Talion and his family are murdered by having their throats slit in some kind of blood sacrifice ritual. I was actually kind of disturbed by the scene. Something about how the bad guys were portrayed as dominieering over the family just made me feel weird. The violence seemed gratuitous but whatever it's just a game.

This sacrifice scene gives a nice taster for the atmosphere of the rest of the game with Talion and the Wraith making edgy comments to each other about ""darkness"" and hatred and how all of Mordor with bow before them and how they cursed and so on and so forth. My favorite comment is when Talion goes to be trained by Torven the hunter in Graug killing. Torvin makes a comment about Talion leading a comfortable life as a guard captain and not having any real scars. Talion responds with something along the lines of ""Watch your words, my scars run deep"", what an edgelord.

The nemesis system is overated. Yeah some familliar faces would pop up now and again but, their personalities weren't really unique and they were more of an annoyance. This may be because I was only killed by orcs about 10 times during the entire game so the only real nemesis I had was some guy from the start of the game who I'd killed quite a few times.

The cutscenes in the game are heavily compressed so expect quite a few artifacts. In addition the characters in the cutscenes reside uncomfortably close to the uncanny valley and in general look quite a bit different from the in game characters.

If you have ever played Assasin's Creed or the Arkham series you will have a pretty good idea of the combat in this game. It has been quite some time since I played Arkham City but, I remember that feeling quite tighter and more tactical. In this game I often feel like I have no control of talion as he leaps around endlessly slashing at Uruks and often choosing the wrong targets and breaking his combo streak. If I press a button I generally cannot interupt talion until he has fininshed even if I have made an error. For example I attact an enemy and then a sheild enemey flanks me and I need to roll out of the way. Well too bad you're getting stabbed. I would like to actually choose my targets as some will counter standard attacts but Talion has a mind of his own.

Some Uruk captains have so many resistances that figting them just becomes a chore. I once faced an Uruk captain who, despite wearing next to no armor was invunerable to ranged attacks, combo finishers, stuns and being jumpped over he also had ""hate of defeat"" which caused his health to regenerate after he had been reduced to 50% health. Combine this with not being able to actually target him and his ability to block standard attaks and force me to roll away he was essentialy impossible to beat without gaming the AI.

The quests often feature arbitrary objectives like killing so many people in some amount of time or in some sort of way and the side quests are often the exact same.

I played this on Linux and it has the honor of being my first Windows port that actually sucks. Wether it starts at all is basically a coin toss and requires me to kill the process from the task manager if it dosen't work. The performance is also about half what I would expect from the Windows version. I have a GTX760 and had to run this on low setting and still couldn't reach a steady 60fps,

Finaly all of the colectables suck and have barely any reward.

The game has excellent combat system with rewarding and satisfying finishers and attacks in general,
Shadow of Mordor has a unique 'Nemesis' system, where you encounter this special orcs, that if you kill them, they'd get replaced by a stronger/weaker ones, but if they kill you.... they actually get stronger and eventually promoted into higher ranks, oh and they actually remember you the next time you fight them. Which is easily the best feature of this game.

now we talk about the negative parts of this game... and there are damn too many of them!

The game is repetitive as HELL and its story is even worse!
I have gotten through the mid point of this game, and I find it such a chore to play this game, the story is boring, and the characters are even worse, not to mention each encounter with the enemy leads to a 15 minutes battle, which brings me to my biggest complaint about this game: this game's respawning rate is the worse I ever have seen (Maybe even worse than FFXV) The game just chucks enemies at you left and right, you kill enemies thinking, oh sweet finally it's over.................
NOPE! Guess again BITCH, 20 more enemies are coming your way ready to F*** you mentally. Making every fight a pain and an annoyance.
Eventually the game throws at you really tough enemies, and I found myself each encounter fighting for 5 minutes, then running for my life in order to heal (via the most retarded healing system possibly of this generation, consuming a plant... Yeah... Not very fun, is it..?)
The places you visits in this game are damn right depressing and there is almost nothing to do in this so called open world, except for killing orcs, which for the first 2 hours is fun, but later it gets tedious.

So to summarize this review: 
Shadow of Mordor, Is a decent game but falls flat for me, due to its repetitive nature and odd and atrocious enemies spawning rate, It's a 6/10. I got it for 5$ during sale, and I don't even know if I will bother finishing it.
Don't get it unless it's on a really good sale, or get it if you like fighting hords of stupid tedious enemies which the game just farts at you.

1177,4,0.5362,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","I really wanted to recommend this game but there are really annoying things in the game, especially early on in the game for newcomers that make the game extremely annoying.

Firstly, I'm running an i7 6700k @4Ghz (stock) with 8Gb x2 RAM @2400Mhz and an MSI Seahawk 980Ti @ factory 1367Mhz core clock. I played the entire game maxed out (minus shadows at medium just because) @ 2560x1080 - 100fps HOWEVER; Since I was playing with Keyboard and Mouse, I had to cap the framerate to 60fps simply because the camera sensitivity is tied to framerate resulting in high fps = slow camera movement. Extremely stupid but you technically can run at 100fps consistently on a 980Ti. 

Now the game itself has a very fun gameplay system which, unlike most games, actually encourages you to try and do different crazy things. Reminded me of Breath of The Wild where you had so many optoins to tackle a scenario but in that game you generally just used your bow and got done with it. In this game however; you do everything, lure beasts, control beasts, poison their food, explode fire places, control them etc which can be A LOT of fun. But here is where the problem is. Firstly, there is no lock on system. So what generally happens is, you build a combo, which allows you to do a finisher. Then when you press F to finish, you MAY kill your target OR you MAY kill someone random. This can be very frustrating because THERE IS NO WAY TO DISABLE FRIENDLY FIRE. So if I had a couple of guys on my side and I'm fighting a horde of enemies, I will very likely kill some of my own men just because the game doesn't care. This brings the next problem. The game literally swarms you with enemies. At first I thought this was incredible. But slowly I realized this is a huge hassle. You may want to kill 1 person. But you'll have to kill 9000 Uruks to do it just because. There's no way to 'destroy' alarms like you can in Assassin's Creed. So enemies which are already high in number will go and attack you while a group of them will set off the alarm causing an excessive amount of enemies to spawn out of nowhere. Moreover; the Uruks you control, aren't exactly that helpful. They attack slowly and you can't rely on them to watch your back. Next comes the ground finishers. 99% of the enemies, after taking certain damage, will go down on to their knees. Now in this state, you cannot attack them with standard attacks. Instead you have to hold shift and then attack to do a ground finish. Not only is that annoying (again - imagine you're surrounded by 50 more Uruks), the ground executions are HORRIBLY SLOW. For instance, your character will stab the guy twice killing him in ground execution. But when he does the first stab, there is a delay long enough for you to be interrupted by other attacks before your character can do the second stab of the ground execution resulting in you rarely ever killing anyone by ground executions when there is a horde of enemies. This forces you to rely on building a combo and pressing F to execute enemies. For me personally, I never grew to accept this. It♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so much. The game technically is really good but this annoying combat system constantly happened especially when trying to kill Captains/Warchiefs. Another thing that I felt was a wasted potential was the 'scare enemies away' concept. You could brutalize an enemy and cause other enemies nearby who saw it to run away in fear. This sounds like a great way to reduce the number of enemies you're fighting BUT you can only do this in stealth. You can't... you know, decapitate 10 guys within 20 seconds and scare off a bunch of people but you can brutally stealth kill someone to make 1 or 2 guys run away. I felt like crowd control was a huge problem. Late game I realized just play as much stealth as possible. Kill people off with the bow and try not to be seen as much as possible since the game didn't know how to control itself with the number of enemies. Moreover; you can NEVER clear out an area completely. You can stay in 1 place and fight for like 30 minutes straight and enemies will keep on coming. Endlessly. It's like being in a Highscore Gauntlet. Kill as many as you can without dying. I personally like emptying fortresses in games like this such as Assassin's Creed. But in this game you can forget it. It's better off to just run away.

Aside from that I feel the game has a very good underlying core gameplay mechanic. It's not too hard to get used to but they just need to tweak the enemies and the targetting system. I love some of the moves. Shadow strike is great for closing the gap, mind control, taking short cuts or simply running away. I love that move it's brilliant. I recall in the Lord of the Hunt DLC, i had to travel around a cliff. I noticed a Goul on the other side where I needed to go. So instead of travelling around, I just Shadow striked to the Goul which was an awesome short cut. The open world isn't much of an open world tbh. There are no villages and shops etc. Just a giant playground with different enemies and creatures for you to play with. Story isn't that great either. But I think this can easily become an addicting game."

The Batman-esque combat system is functional, yet not exciting. Everything ultimately comes down to button mashing. Honestly, you can fare pretty well using only three buttons - attack, block, and execute. Yes, that is an oversimplification, although the game is still rather easy for a competent gamer. This issue bleeds into the most ""marketable"" aspect of Shadow of Mordor, namely the Nemesis System.

While this system looks good on paper, it falls flat after you play for a couple of hours. All these ""unique"" orc personalities and traits cease to matter after you find out that most of the Captains drop like flies. Kill enough of them and the system simply runs out of elements at its disposal. A colourful band of Uruks will soon blend into a homogenous mass of baddies-you-have-seen-before. During my playthrough some of the Captains I killed came back and wanted to enact revenge on me, yet I had no recollection of actually killing them. They were this disposable.

The storytelling is not worth your time, either. The main plot feels short and forgettable. I managed to 100% the main game in around 23 hours. It may seem reasonable, but once you take into account the time spent on searching pointless collectibles, saving pointless slaves in a series of simillar missions, and general faffing about, you will end up with maybe a quarter of that time dedicated to the main story. There is not even a climactic and challenging final boss that would justify all this. Out of three main antagonists, only one really fights you. The battle goes down just like a fight with a Captain, and by then you had probably fought dozens of them. The second is reduced to a simplistic stealth challenge that is almost a glorified QTE, and the final boss actually IS a QTE. The ""bad fanfiction"" quality of the story also does not help.

Fortunately, I got this game at a steep discount, so in the end I do not feel robbed.

Still, after everything that was said, I struggle to actually rate the game. Steam really needs a ""neutral"" rating. However, given that I still have DLC stories to play, but I feel no desire to do so, I have no other choice than give Shadow of Mordor a thumbs down."

The story is told only in cutscenes and is basically the ""reach the antagonist sitting up in his tower"" cliche you find in most games. Boss fights are generic Quick Time Events... and not even the grandiose spectacular ones.

There is a lack of diversity in enemies and quests wich is a crime in such a complex world that is Middle Earth, the game bashes Tolkien's lore with a ridiculous script that would make professor turn in his grave.
There are other options that give you the opportunity to explore and enjoy Middle Earth (LOTRO, War in the North), the feeling is that this game could have been situated in any other scenario as a simple action game with minor RPG elements.

Storyline and graphics are good.  Combat can be fun sometimes, but is usually frustrating (typically due to something out of your control like forced cutscenes; input lag or not doing what you expected the game to do).

Buggy, frustrating mess of a game.  Designed for consoles.  Mediocore PC port.  Poor keybinds.  One key for multiple actions (ie. ctrl = grab opponent, grab item, mount; item is in front of you but the game will make you mount the nearest beast...).


Good:
- Graphics
- Audio
- Storyline
- Combat (sometimes)

Bad:
- Controls (some of which can't be rebound)
- Mouse sensitivty is broken and changes often throughout the game
- Combat (sometimes)
- Designed for consoles, so all the usually garbage you get with a pc port
- DLC (adds a few new gimmicks but nothing worthy of a paid DLC; no new places to explore, just reuses the other content and adds some new quests/audio/whatever)
- Unskippable cutscenes (only a few cutscenes are skippable but most aren't; captain/warchief hello/bye/escape cutscenes are very annoying after a while)
- Game plays differently each time you do something (ie. I want to jump from one ledge to another - sometimes I will jump to the ledge, other times I will roll because jump/roll use the same key, other times I won't do anything, other times I'll fall off the ledge, other times I'll jump to a different ledge to the left/right of me, etc)"

1206,3,0.399,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I've tried with this game twice and I just can't like it. I can see all the things that make it so popular, such as the nemesis system, the open world, and the myriad of ways you can approach any situation, unfortunately, it simply doesn't resonate with me.

Let me be clear; I LOVE open world games. I have sunk more hours than I care to count into the likes of GTA, Zelda: BotW, Far Cry, Skyrim, and others, but this world simply doesn't pull me in or evoke any feeling of immersion.

One of my biggest issues with the game is in regards to the control mechanics. Every single input is sluggish and awkward, and makes moving smoothly around an enemy encampment a terrible chore. Animation frames are given complete priority, meaning if you let off a given movement control, then press another one, you will need to wait for the character animation to catch up with your intent. This typically means up to a second or more of input delay while your character finishes that last walk animation; and when trying to sneak smoothly around a baddie or creep up on him to deliver a finisher, this can-and routinely does-spell death for the player. During combat, this is less of a concern, due to the fact it takes the AC/Batman combat theory of strike/counter/finisher rhythm, and needed inputs are easy to input with a wide tolerance for timing. THAT SAID: I can't say enough how much I hate the chaotic combat in the game. Multiple times I was inundated by enemies, and nothing I could do could save me from a hopeless, frustrating death.

I know what you're thinking: get gud noob. Well, I was literally an hour into the game both times, on a main mission, and I was completely overrun. I don't care how bad of a gamer you are, that's a poor difficulty spike. It's not even excusable by saying I went off-path and ran into overleveled enemies, because I didn't. I followed a story mission and a scripted event threw an overwhelming number of enemies at me.

It certainly doesn't help that enemy encampments will fill back up with bad guys almost immediately after you've killed everyone, especially after the end of a mission, killing any feeling of progression, and making getting from one side of the map to the other a slog.  I was more than a little dismayed to have finally completed a mission only to watch as little red arrows streamed back into my area almost immediately, cutting off my escape route. Why can't that area stay cleared at least for a little bit? Let me get somewhere else and do some more missions before you stack an area back up.

The graphics are very good, and the only gripe I have is with the overly bland maps. Nothing ever looks particularly awe-inspiring, and at least in the areas I saw, there was no variety or distinguishing landmarks. The character models do look fantastic, but they are placed atop generic cliffs, watchtowers, and ruined buildings that again, begin to blend together. All I know is I'm in Baddieville, then I'm in West Baddieville, then I'm in South-West Baddieville, and it all looks the same. Speaking of all looking the same, I'm over Wraith Mode, Detective Mode, Eagle Vision, and every other ""-vision"" mode. They all ape each others' mechanics and features, from following tracks on the ground to differentiating the ""informant"" enemies and this game mechanic has pretty much run its course in my opinion. There are some creative ways this has been used in SoM, such as requiring the power in order to find artifacts, but after the umpteenth time using it to find a worm, artifact, or set of enemies that I'm [i]desperately[/i] trying not to get seen by, it becomes just another game mechanic, and one that's been explained and implemented better in other games.

Sound is good, all the effects are there from the movie trilogy, the music is nice, the voice acting is satisfactory. Some lines are delivered with a hollow lack of conviction, as if they were recorded on a Monday, and the Uruk chatter gets annoying, particularly since they all seem to be the same three guys from Lower London. Finishing moves are all juicy, crunchy affairs, and are nice and punchy at first, but again, after about the 100th stealth kill, sounds like you're stepping on a bag of potato chips. Also, minor gripe but we'll throw it on the pile, half my stealth kills involve my victim screaming his fool head off as I drag him down and open him up, but no one heard that? Okay.

Really, there's a lot of good stuff in this game, but it all overlaps horribly. It feels as though missions push up against one another in the world, and with the every area teeming with baddies, I never felt as though I could just cleanly complete a mission. I was always in shields-up mode, and it always felt as though I was on the defensive. Others may love that, but for me, it wasn't an enjoyable way to play the game. The progression system is interesting, but convoluted with two completely separate progression trees in addition to two kinds of experience, XP, and Power. You need Power (gained from defeating Captains) in order to unlock an ability before you can learn it with XP gained from missions and tasks. On top of the two skill trees, runes, nemeses, Focus, Elf-Shot, along with the very real danger of being clubbed to death by 10+ enemies at once, the game turns into too much for me to handle.

I go to pause the game and there's an ad for the real money store and an urgent message to go purchase the amazing, incredible, all-new, (monitized), Middle Earth (TM): Shadow of War(TM). No thanks.

You may love this game, but I sure didn't. If you need a numerical score to make it through life, I'd give this a 4/10, mainly because I see it has a bunch of great gameplay in it, but nothing is ever running [i]smoothly[/i], and the game as a whole is hurt by it in the face of better, more focused offerings.

Cheers."

  Also, the lack of an easy mode sucks because this game is far too complicated for me (I'm 28 so maybe I'm just getting too old for gaming?) and requires quick and precise button presses.

[b][u]Lore:[/u][/b] Excellent. Especially, game is focused on giving us lore about the less commonly known parts of lore while also dropping in bits about the most known/popular characters and stories in between the game. For example, you get to know orcs and uruks, their cultures and their lives in detail, you get to know about the darker sides of Gondorians and about the other humans living in and beyond Mordor and what events has happened around Mordor before all the Black Gate business, etc. Generally story and lore is very smoothly drawn together and they just flow across the game very fluidly. Game creates and follows a very different path to reach the Sauron and the Rings story than we are familiar with.
[b][u]Cutscene Quality:[/u][/b] Godlike. Seriously.
[b][u]Gameplay Quality:[/u][/b] Boring and repetetive. Generally it's a very low quality gameplay, involving moving about inconsistent map instances to chase points of interests and grind towards your objectives.
[b][u]Gameplay Mechanics:[/u][/b] Beyond terrible. Anyone can immediately notice how everything is fully hardcoded.
[b][u]Combat Mechanics:[/u][/b] Hideous, boring, repetitive and unrealistic. Made out of hardcoded scripts, forex; you might often find Talion teleporting around to block that or dodge this 10 meter behind him. You can engage in a hardcoded special combat finisher animation/cutscene againsts an uruk captain while 30 others around you start circling around and watch it finish to take a swing (anyone just starting a swing will also stop and back off). Extremely awkward scenes all around. For example, you can knock down and stab an orc on the neck at the start of your ground finisher move, but if you interrupt it before it's fully completed to block another uruks swing at you, it's like that never happened. That orc will act like he never had a half sword pierced through his neck. After blocking that other guy, you can always start stabbing it again, as many times as you like except if you leave him alone for too long; then he will get up and start fighting you again.
[b][u]Graphics:[/u][/b] Okay. Has ups and downs.
[b][u]Sounds:[/u][/b] Great. No flaws to speak of. Voice actors have done a brilliant job.

Personally ended up grinding through a low quality and boring game to keep taking on small bites from the story and lore. I'm okay towards carrot on a stick to a degree but whats in between felt tedious, boring and bland.

[b][u]Unless;[/u][/b]
-Your expectations of gameplay (and mechanics) isn't too high. 
-You can move through the ride without looking at the details and corners too hard, don't mind too much about immersion as you are okay with ""just playing a game""

I like games placed in Middle-Earth and this one is ... neither good nor bad. It's just a basic swordfighting game, with some more or less optional ""stealth"". Basic, because you only use 1 key most of the time (+ direction) during fights, ocassionally you use block, even more rare is when you have to simply jump away. As for story - that one is not so bad, but it is very short. Actually most of the time you simply fight waves of orcs and forget about the story, which is quite simple - get revenge. Really, I was expecting more from game adopting Tolkiens world.

DLCs - there are actually 2 of them: Lord of the Hunt and The Bright Lord. In this action RPG, DLCs give you ""campaigns"" in which you get already fully upgraded characters, only without runes (which is a way to give you more perks), or rather, without those you were looking for in the main game. That makes the later one quite challenging, because your character is much weaker than the original hero. Again, there is not much to the story in those DLCs and again gameplay is very repetitive."

If you get into combat and mobs of orcs join in, you're in for a long--and I mean LONG--boring fight sequence because the game seems to be geared around killing things more or less by using 'finishers.' Regular attacks seem to do very little against their health. Talk about tedious! The depth of the combat seems to reach its apotheosis with learning more button pressing combos which is sure to become repetitive. Upon reflection, you could just say the combat is, in a nutshell, just a bunch of capcom-style button mashing interwoven with QTEs. I found myself getting bored of it very quickly.

The camera, good lord, is it just in the most irritatingly close position all of the time... Not to mention that the running isn't streamlined where you just hold forward and it automatically makes you run after a bit--you actually have to hold a button.

The controls are not really comfortable, but taking a look at the amount of actions you can perforn, you do need to reserve a lot of action keys.

The graphics as per 2018 is ""ok"". The screenshots you see on Steam are not the in-game screenshots. I had a feeling that the camera should have been moved further from the character, because the way it is in the game, reminded me the way the games looked on the first generations of consoles.

The story was not really interesting for me. The battle system was quite badly designed with an aim to achieve something like in The Batman series, but come on, Batman was always trying to save people's lifes, so intead of injuring them, he preferred to knock them out, while here in Mordor, you barely want to do that to an orc, so I think that instead of this battle style, the devs should have just kept the typical slasher style, like in the Witcher games, for example.

The finishers are great. When you reach the point of being able to use charged attack twice, the battles become realy awesome and bring joy.

The environments are really boring, dull, low-poly with high res textures. Very bad!

It kind of sucks to see enemies everywhere, if there's an objective in enemy stronghold (oh boy) then you've no choice but to play stealth and look for a way to do a finisher move on him and then again go to stealth mode again to look for the next objective. If we could play both ways, hack n slash and stealth, with equal opportunities then it could've been better.
Though we get the AoE attack upgrades, they're not even close to finishing enemies, to kill them quickly we have to ultimately use finishers. And goddamn if some random arrow hits us while performing the finisher.

I'm playing on keyboard and mouse. EVERYTHING in this game feels like a f-ing Quicktime Event. From running to fighting to sneaking. It also doesn't help that the game has some totally overloaded control schemes with way to many different keys. Remapping it to your taste is also not a viable option since some functions in once context overlap with other in a different context.

The game itself has an interesting lore but the world feels somewhat empty; even though there is a shitton of always-the-same types of enemies swarming around everywhere. I just found it tedious to fight after a while because this is purely quantity over quality."
1236,3,0.3595,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I just finished this game yesterday. If you can call it a game. It's a QTE fest actually. The gameplay is make it or break it, but I cannot recommend this game personally.

Ok, good things first: atmosphere was amazing. If you like Peter Jackson's movies, you will like this one. It is a collectathon, but collecting various pieces of lore gives you a nice, voice acted, flavor text. And voice acting is great. Story was good, if a little too cliche. Nemesis system was just OK but maybe I expected more of it. It becomes more interesting later in the game when you get the ability to command orcs (you don't micro-manager them, they fight by your side). And you can see how having higher ranking orcs by your side makes the game interesting. Graphics are great for a 2014 game and it still look good. I think they did a very good job with draw distance and I never noticed major popping. Level design is also very good and accommodates all styles of play (melee, ranged and stealth).

Now, the bad things: combat, the meat and potatoes of this game is a joke. It's a glorified QTE. You just left-click, with occasional right-click until your combo meter fills up. Then you click one of the keys on the keyboard, depending on the skill you unlocked, to use that skill. There is little to no movement in combat. And movement is really clunky. You stick to every edge, every rock taller than your knee, and there is no dedicated jump button. You also stick to every enemy you attack. I guess it looks more badass that way since they can do all sorts of crazy animations, but I don't feel I did any of that. Ranged combat is also a joke. You get into a slow time mode and all the enemies and intractable objects highlight. I don't know if that can be turned off, but by default it's on. The slow down mode is on a meter though, but it lasts too long and fills up quickly. Stealth is also not very good, although it is better than combat. It is fun in forts with a lot of orcs, but their detection radius is way too small. It is nice to do parkour and stealth kill orcs, and it is just like Assassin's Creed (mind you, I only played the first one). But it too suffers from sticky movement. If you alert orcs, but want to remain unseen, you can often get stuck to walls while trying to run away which makes orcs detect you. Mounted combat also has its flaws. One of the sins of this game is that it binds many actions to one key/button. For example, while riding a caragor (it's a beast you can mount) you can right click to make it bite enemies and restore its health, but if you hold right click you enter the ranged slow time mode. More than few times I pressed the right click a fraction of a second too long and entered ranged mode instead of healing my caragor. But the worst offense this game makes is the final boss: IT'S A FREAKING QTE!!! You just press the key that pops up three or four times and you beat the game. Good thing I only paid $5 for it.

Why did I play it then? Well, for the atmosphere mainly. Also, late in the game nemesis system becomes much more interesting. If you like stealth, which is the best of three play styles in my opinion, you can do some very cool stuff without drawing your weapon.

Would I recommend it? If you hate sticky movement and rhythm combat i wouldn't. But if you like that, or can get over it, sure. Great atmosphere, good lore chinks, good voice acting. If you like Tolkien it's a must on that front. It is an older game and you can find it on sale quite often. Don't pay more than $5 or $10 for it."

So, why I gave this game a negative review VS. Mad Max.  Made by the same compainies etc etc.

Well, the graphics are ok, thought they could be a bit better, heck, fallout LV looked better, it just didn't feel emersive enough, but that's something that I can easily overlook if it wasn't for the map/objective layout.  How is it in Mad Max I felt like a God at fighting and this game I feel like randomly mashing buttons and hoping for the best.  The fight system is definitly more complicated and the intro tutorials that I played twice seem to breeze by things really quick so you don't get much time to cement what is what.  Seems like the game was made more for a controller?  I find myself accidently going in ghost/shadow mode during some fights because I am predicting the attack to early which kinda breaks the emersion.  And Mad Max, even the beggining fights felt good and energetic.  In this game I feel like granny with a broom wackin them no good kids. (I know, I know, in this day and age that's now an arestable offence to punish or wach your kids or others) even if they are bad.  So the fighting just kinda feels off, then there is the story sequence that just kinda pops up out of nowhere and seems to actually interupt things.  I mean Mad Max wasn't 100%, I mean with the story suddenly rushing through at the end, but it felt more natural than this.  After playing Mad Max I was really hoping for something better out of this game.  I mean there are games like assasins creed, and Decay of State that did things so much better.   I mean, the ""stealth"", your guy is a God, to kill 4 people all about 2 feet apart and no one notices?  lol...  The character upgrade screen just felt sloppy and useless as well.  It's like ""all the kiddies like this lets throw it in""(afterthought).   I will continue to play through it for a bit longer, but it's just not as smooth.  Kinda like a consol port that didn't go quite right.  I mean, I have graphics set at ""Ultra"", and they really don't look that great.

Mad Max I didn't think I would get into and I loved it, this game I thought I would love and just can't get into it.

But what I found might be one of the most horribly bland and annoying games i've ever played.

The game is skewed towards simply doing the same sneak kills OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. But this is somehow better than the standard fight system, which is pretty much button mashing. ONE BUTTON for attack, ONE BUTTON for perry, NOTHING for solid defense. Every in battle animation only works to interrupt game play and disorient you. I'm in a fight, suddenly a captain appears, I forget my strategy or heading and in some cases it causes me to lose fights.

The story mode is difficult to follow, only because you are CONSTANTLY DEVIATED by the endless streams of Uruk/Orc ranking. But when you try, for a seemingly open world, it's all becomes so horribly linear. At least, until you get interrupted YET AGAIN by what I can only refer to as useless Uruk/Orc politics. The only satisfaction I found in this game, is hunting down and killing the captain who snuck up behind me in a brawl and used his cheesy battle advantages to score a sneak shot and kill me. But even after a while, THAT got old and I ceased to care.

The overall plot of this game is completely meaningless if you know anything about the lore. If your mission is to take down Sauron, and you don't have furry hobbit feet, you aren't going to win. Getting revenge on another enemy might have given a sense of satisfaction when finishing this game, but from the start you know your character is doomed. Nothing about that is exciting.

It's repetitive, irritating, depressing, and utterly boring.
Saying ""would not recommend"" is an understatement.

Overall, I would conclude that the game virtually combined everything I don't like in video games into a single package.

In case you're wondering, I generally try to finish everything I start, so long as the game isn't completely broken, and thankfully this game isn't that.

Shadow of Mordor is an open world game with a mix of melee combat and stealth, topped off with some RPG elements. Now I don't like any of the gameplay styles in it to begin with, from the rhythm-like Arkham-inspired combat, to the fast paced, combat focused Assassin's-Creed-stealth, and the parkour-based world naviagtion, but my primary complaint with this game is that there is just way too much hand-holding everywhere. When you're sneaking around, the detection radius of enemies for example is extremely forgiving, and they take a long time to notice you too. You can run around crouched without making any noise, and instakill moves are extremely easy to pull off. When you actually get into combat, the game gives you generously long button prompts to let you counter, making it very easy to fight a large group of enemies you're surrounded by without taking any damage (so long as there aren't any archers around).

I'm not going to cover why I don't like the 3 afforementioned mechanics as a whole, since I think it's quite subjective, but I'll talk a little bit about some other things that people who enjoy them may still find the game did poorly.

The open world is designed in a way that every area felt pretty much the same. There's barely any variety in the locations as you would see in a game like The Witcher, with enemies are scattered in a regular pattern across it. It falls victim to the old genre flaw, and gets very repetitive fast. Near to all secondary content aside from collectibles resolve around killing groups of enemies using the mix of stealth and melee fighting the game offers. They're often located in set encampments, which are largely all designed in the same way. A few scattered buildings, traps, and rooftops with wires stretching out to link them.

Part way through the game, you get the ability to get AI to fight alongside you, however due to the very limited control you have over targetting melee attacks, a lot of the time you'll just hit them with friendly fire. It ruins what could've been a great mechanic almost completely.

There are also fights you can do with 'captains' existing outside of traditional missions, which is a feature that the game puts centre stage. It's similar to Mercenaries' or Crackdown's scattering of boss characters wild in the world for you to kill without being put on a linear path for it, however the difference with Shadow of Mordor is that the fights are very homogenous. They largely consist of you stalking similar looking camps, and picking off guards, before confronting them in melee. They almost all go the same way. Rinse and repeat. It's interesting in spite of its repetitiveness, but it doesn't intergrate with the main quest well. There are two points during the story we're you're told to go off and fight captains, the rest is filled with traditional, linear missions. There are also only 20, and some I feel don't advance the story at all, and would be the kind that usually exist as side quests in other open world games.

On to the writing, as someone who isn't familiar with the source material, the story left me confused. It's certainly very light on it, as it's only advanced through cutscenes during the story missions, so due to how few there are, everything felt either rushed or absent.

In conclusion, Shadow of Mordor is one of those games that want to make you feel like a badass without you doing anything in the game that's actually difficult to do. I know there are people who like that sort of thing, and would enjoy sitting down and spending a few hours at casual badassadry in a game like this to relax. I'm not one of them, but I think Middle Earth is still plenty flawed for stuff in that category."

Tallion was alright as a protaganist, but I found it quite hard to connect with his actions. Things just seem to happen but I was interested enough to accept what was happening.

The game looks really good, and the animations give the game a great sense of fluidity. However, I found the camera difficult to control, especially when sneaking around. I wish there was more customisation options in the controls, as having three or four different actions bound to one key to be annoying at best and obtuse at worst.

Combat is the bread and butter of the game, and I have no issues with the mechanics. The combat is mostly button mashing LMB, but you can also sneak attack, counter opponents and dodge roll around so there's decent variety. My issue with the combat is you're almost constantly fighting groups or hordes of enemies when you only intended to fight one or two. Although countering enemies is really forgiving (it basically always interrupts whatever you're doing), it becomes ridiculous when you're fighting off literally twenty Urks.

In the end, I was just left in a bland Mordor landscape, surrounded by Urks, not invested in the characters or story with an alright combat system and too many UI Elements constantly pinging me about new quests and how I was being beaten to death.

But I'm downvoting it because it's VERY obvious that they wanted to maximise profits by splitting this game into two: Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War.
There is very little content in this game. The extra length is because of a couple grinding missions that take hours.
The story content is obviously only half a story too.

Oh and big final battle where the two armies clash?
It consists of about 30 enemies. What the hell were they thinking?

The combat was satisfying though.

It's just a real shame that the game was so obvioulsy meant to be only half a game. Simply split for more profit.
Pick this and the sequel up in a few years time when it's cheap, and only if you don't mind a bit of grinding.

1272,4,0.6837,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","I do not recommend this game. The spawning system is really terrible. One thing you know you're just trying to beat a campaign then a bunch of captains appear before you get to kill your main goal then next thing you know those captains call on reinforcements and sometimes they bring a fucking captain with them and you can't really kill them fast enough because most of the time you need to do finishers just to defeat enemies faster than usual or else it takes them like more than 10 slashes to die. If that's not bad enough, you only hit one enemy despite them being bunched up, you also have annoying archers everywhere shooting at you and you're just trying to get that 8 combo so you can do a finisher. Then there's also the defenders which have a shield and a long ass range with its spear. And it if isn't enough some of the captains are immune to long range so no elf arrows.

Plus the spawning issue, you're like in this area and you just finished clearing it. Then you just went 200 meters away for a second then bam next thing you know the army is back. What the hell? 

I also dislike how your pet caragon disappears when you take on any quest. Speaking of caragons, this is suppose to be mordor.

Shadow of mordor closely resembles assassin's creed when it comes to it's movement, batman when it comes to it's combat, and combines those with the nemesis system to distinguish itself from the said titles. 

The movement, i think they've nailed. Your character feels responsive, climbing is quick and fluid, speed boost after jumping off/over things is amazing, pace at which you sneak, shadow stepping behind enemies, all of those are great.

The combat is batmanlike, meaning on a basic level, you're just mashing 1 key and choosing the direction of your hits. Mashy combat isn't necessarily always a bad thing and while usually easy it can be fun if the animations are of high quality, which they are. But, as far as i'm concerned, shadow of mordor doesn't reach the quality level of batman combat [b]even though[/b] it follows mostly the same principles. I'm not sure exactly why and i'd have to go back and replay batman to get better insight, but in short i'd give a few reasons :

1. I think it's partly because in batman it feels as if your hits have force behind them, compared to shadow of mordor where basic attacks don't feel as impactful.
2. There's a bigger set of moves and gadgets.
3. Higher animation variety for basic attacks.

The most unique combat mechanic is branding, an ability to take control of an orc/orc captain and his followers and have them fight alongside you but it is introduced too late into the game, when most of us already have a set approach to doing things.

The nemesis system is basically a system for procedurally generating mini bosses, and surprisingly on the surface it works pretty well, you'd think procedurally generated orc captains (mini bosses) would be very generic, but because of their unique models/voices/combat traits they mostly feel handcrafted. 

This feature is supposedly considered the main selling point of the game, is it a good feature? It is. Is it enough to carry the game? It wouldn't be even if it was implemented perfectly and it isn't, so [b]no[/b].

The main reason why the nemesis system fails is the fact that the game is way too [b]easy[/b].
You spend a huge chunk of playtime mowing through hordes of braindead orcs and these orc captains are supposed to bring a change of pace, to stand out, change your gameplay and they can, the problem is, unless you specifically let them kill you over and over again or pass the time, that won't happen. They will be too low level, too weak and will get butchered, forgotten and replaced just like all the normal orcs. Your last miniboss before you finish the game is an orc captain that is supposed to be your nemesis, you're supposed to know who he is from all the times you fought him. But guess what? Because none of the orc captains posed a threat and died in 1-2 attempts i had no idea who this dude was. To me he was another generic orc captain.
So yeah, for you to have some proper fun it is expected from you to die on purpose, which to me is bad game design.

This is the primary thing from which the nemesis system suffers, but the game being easy damages other parts of it aswell.

Apart from the nemesis system, the game being too easy also ruins combat and the interesting branding mechanic. 
If you have a big variety of abilties you can use but there's no motivation to use any of them, you'll just end up using whatever you're used to and whatever works best, and for me that was the bow. Bow headshots just insta-kill all non captain orcs and because of that i ignored a decent chunk of combat abilities. 
The same applies to branding, there really isn't a single point in the game where you [b]feel[/b] that branding is necessary, so even though it's an interesting mechanic you end up not bothering with it.

The boss encounters are terrible, there is [b]no[/b] difference between boss encounters and orc captains, bosses totally feel as if you're fighting a regular orc captain. The cherry on top is  that the last boss himself is also a QTE sequence....Having the last boss be a QTE sequence feels like an insult to the player, honestly...

The game isn't helped by the fact that the side activities are extremely boring. You acquire collectibles, collect herbs, free prisoners, but it's all very basic and shallow and exists solely to increase your play time.

On the topic of collectibles i've just mentioned, the game has you spin these random objects (when you first obtain them) until you find a ""memory point"" and then boom, you get to hear a few lore related lines of dialogue. Things that go further into the gameworld lore can be nice, but [b]only[/b] if you have made the player invested in the story/lore in the first place. Collectibles should just be extras that enrich the story after it has been presented well enough during gameplay and cutscenes.

Sadly, the main story here is so forgettable that these lore bits from collectibles don't mean shit. I always attempt to get invested in a games story and if it's interesting i end up remembering quite a bit about it. This one didn't catch my attention at all, all that i remember is [spoiler]you share your 
body with some elf and you're trying to get revenge, so you do stuff for the said elf [/spoiler], that's the extent of my knowledge, that's how much i cared.

Characters are forgettable, with the exception of ratbag.

When it comes to visuals, it does have some high quality graphics but that doesn't save the overall aesthetic of the game. To me this is a game with one of the ugliest environments i've seen in a while. The zones look terrible, the first one is predominantly brown, consisting of rocks/mud/ruins/forts scattered around and the second one is basically the same just recolored to green. The part of visuals that somewhat save  thhis games aesthetic have got to be the orcs. The orcs look amazing. Best looking orcs in anygame to date, hands down.


In total i clocked in at only 13 hours to beat the game and that includes doing a solid amount of side activities, which for an open world game is kinda low (compared to let's say batman which had side activities that were more interesting and provided higher playtime), although considering how repetitive the game is it's probably for the best. 

The thing about shadow of mordor is, it ticks all the required boxes to be great from a technical standpoint (visual fidelity, sound, animations etc.) but from artistic (aside from the amazing looking orcs) and gameplay standpoints (which is the most important thing), it's mediocre at best and feels more like a proof of concept, a demo. I'm sure there's fun to be had judging by the steam reviews, but imo there's too much work expected to be done by the player to create fun in shadow of mordor.

Nevertheless, if you've liked games like assassins creed and batman, or if you can create your own fun/adventure (hunting a specific captain, creating an orc clan war) i'd still tell you to give this a shot, if not, then surely stay away, this game is as far as i'm concerned a mindless repetitive orc killing simulator and probably a demo for shadow of war."

Also - controls sucks, you may customize them a bit before you start playing - I suggest switching stealth off shift to different button.

Special missions are boring since when I get to do a boss mission I want to challange him once and then suddenly there is 3 or 4 of them fighting me at the same time, Some of them outlevel me 3-4 times and they appear wherever I go (literally other side of the boss there is same character that pops out of nowhere and joins the fight making it impossible to win).

Aside from the wonky targetting controls (combo's ready, activates finisher: game changes target for no reason and beheads YOUR lieutenant who was standing behind you) the game's just no risk and all reward... 

Losing and dying doesn't matter in the slightest... I mean I understand that you're undead according to the story and therefore death holds no meaning for your character blah blah blah, but as a gameplay mechanic it completely devalues all effort put into progression. Death just transports you and the enemies around the map, and you lose nothing but travel time. There's no ""I haven't saved in half an hour, gotta do all that stuff again..."" or any sort of currency or equipent durability penalty or any sort of tangible penalty for losing. What's the point in trying not to die once you've achieved your objective? There isn't one. I even died on purpose many times just because it was faster than walking.

Then there's the combat... Even on the hard difficulties, the game holds your hand through every phase of combat. It's practically patronizing you with how easy it makes everything: ""Finish the 1-button combo little Timmy... let me slow time for you so you can block easier... and now counter him with the same button... Good job! You won by pressing 2 buttons and with minimal effort! You're doing so well!"" You jump, shoot, dash and slash you way through hordes of inept grunts that spend more times waving their swords around and getting riled up than actually attacking. It's so easy that it becomes tedious... After a while you can't tell if you're slaughtering Orcs in Mordor or mining ore nodes in Warcraft... they're both as tedious and low-risk as eachother.

I got through the first area and into the second before I just couldn't do it anymore... I got bored during the FIRST LEVEL, and gave up in the second because it didn't introduce anything new. Other than some completely superfluous skills you need for the story (and that you'll probably never use again after said story requirement) there are no new skills or unlocks beyond the first level. I know because I was so hungry for something new in this that I looked it up on their wiki and in YouTube videos: there is in fact nothing you have during the first level that won't let you win in the last level, aside from story required skills to get you there.

This game is a millennial's dream: everyone wins and feels awesome all the time despite how much or how little they earned it, and nobody ever fails and gets their feelings hurt because of their lack of reaction time or poor spacial awareness and therefore they never have to change.

The story was not good at all, and on top of that most of the fill in information of the story is found through pick-ups instead of being displayed through the game. The DLC did not add much to the game in terms of content and gameplay. They introduced some new models, voicelines and visuals but the gameplay was entirely the same- with new mechanics just being old mechanics reintroduced into new abilities in different ways. If I was the Dark Lord, I would hire WB to make more dlc as they have done to give the game effectively the same missions over 8 similar maps with all the stuff they've kept throwing in- then I would make my enemies play this game until they 100% it with all the new dlc and then maybe throw them in a fire because even though I am the Dark Lord- I would feel bad for how much I made them suffer.

I was not one of them.  You might ask, 'how could you not like an open world, Assassin's Creed inspired Lord of the Rings game where you fight custom nemesis and magically brand orcs to fight for you?'

Easy, is the answer.  The game is too easy.  (And no, I didn't use any of the op DLC weapons, before you ask)

The basic premise is this:  you are a warrior stuck in Mordor, surrounded by armies of orcs.  When you die, the orc leader that killed you gains new abilities and 'levels up', becoming a Nemesis.  The idea being he will be more difficult, and thus more rewarding, to kill later.

The issue is, you have to die.  And in this game it's difficult to do.  Your attack animations are easily cancelable so you can always block no matter what at the last second.  I probably don't need to explain further, but there's no risk in attacking.  As a result, the game quickly introduces extremely cheap and unfun ranged enemies to help kill you.  Focus these defensively weak enemies first and the rest is a joke.

I played for 15 hours and never died (outside of forced story issues).

Still, what's so bad about never dying and killing legions of orcs?

It's boring in the same way Dynasty Warriors is boring.  But this game lacks the hundreds of on screen enemies.  (Granted, the game does do an excellent job of having a lot of enemies on screen).

My second major issue was the other selling point of the game:  branding orcs.  Essentially, you can weaken an orc through combat then 'brand' them to fight for you....thus building your own army.

The problem: the game doesn't introduce this ability until around 3/4 of the way in.  By then I was so bored of killing orcs over and over and completing the same side quests over and over, I lost complete interest in this.  If this ability had been introduced earlier in the game, I know I would have stuck around until the end.

All in all, my complaints may seem nit picky.  I mean the graphics are great, the gameplay is very enjoyable, and the added character customization is never something to be frowned upon.

Plus, Lord of the Rings lore.

But, while the majority will like it, this review is for those like me who get bored by easy, grindy games.  There's so many great games out there these days, this one isn't worth it.

Several reasons make this game trash in my book.

1. Combat is extremely bland and easy. 
Basic Gameplay consists of mashing X until propted to press Y within the next 2 seconds to block. I headed for the highest tier of mini-boss after 2 hours and beat him and 12 orcs by literally only pressing two buttons on my controller. Every other axpect of Combat is a bonus and pressing buttons in a certain order will reward you with flashy animations and sounds as well as making Orcs die faster. 

2. Enemies have a metric shitton of Health. 
Bashing a low-level Orcs head in 5 times should kill him, instead basic enemies are bulletsponges (Swordsponges?).

3. Story is forced and unintersting. 
So far i had a wife and son who died in the tutorial, some elf is possessing me and Gollum is in the game for some reason.

4. The World is repetitive. 
Its literally all the same. Orcs or whatever sit in three tiers of Forts or just stand around in small 
groups doing nothing.

5. AI is dumb as shit. 
Killing several Orcs right next to some other Orc while in stealth is extremely easy. Orcs also tend to have horrible pathfinding. If you stand on top of a building they will all climb the ladder, one after the other, then give you a 2 second window to kill them since they will be in the longest getting-up animation since GTAV. They also love to get stuck on everything that has a collider.

Overall:

If you wanna feel like a superhero with a sword for two hours after coming home to your one-room apartment after flipping burgers for minimum wage, this game is perfect for you.

They all do pretty much the same in battle, except for shield-bearers and archers and are simple cannon fodder - yet quite robust cannon fodder as long as you don't use Insta-Kill skills. Killing 100 orcs thus can take several minutes of alternating left and right clicking, only interrupted by the occasional Insta-Kill button. 
Fighting for live and death against impossible odds never felt so much like work."

The whole world seems not very alive since enemies are constantly respawning and you do not have the impression to make any lasting change. Doesnt really matter if you kill someone...there will be a (or a dozen) replacement very soon.

Furthermore I am not a big fan of the fighting style.
To me it feels very artificial.
Sometimes you feel unbeatable since you can block any blockable attack very easily. Dodging is harder but not very much. I normally die only if there are far too many enemies or a lot of archers or, which is just extremely frustrating, because I cannot move and dodge properly because of the stupid terrain.

So sometimes you kill a hard boss in secons and in other situations you try to kill a capatin and he just calls for backup and his backup calls also for backup and in a blink of an eye there are 15 normal orcs and 3 captains and a couple of archers...very frustrating and to me really random."

OH HERE'S YOUR WIFE'S CORPSE! HERE'S A CUTE SCENE! STEALTH! NOW THEY'RE DEAD! AND NOW IT'S MUMM-RA THE EVER LIVING AS AN ELF! ISN'T THIS GAME FUN?!"". It gets worse from there.

The game literally drops you from the swirling mass of where you were dead into... I have no idea the game doesn't actually tells you, something about a wall I believe. It then sends you on your merry way to fight. This should be where the game gets good, right? It's the combat that shines, right? Yeah, not really. Killing mooks is a decent enough amount of fun, but regularly I found myself getting ganged on by 2 or even 3 ""Champions"" that came running out of nowhere, and when I tried to stealth kill the stealth weak boss... it did nothing. Woot intel, and crap.

I'm going to keep trying at it for a bit, but honestly I just can't see any joy in this game. It's just a revenge for revenge sake mission that has no impact on the Tolkien universe (we ALL KNOW what happens to the ring), with another brooding beardo full of grit that'll projectile emo at your screen, unleashing such vengeful fury that you're pretty sure his skull will ejaculate his hair at any moment, turning him just as bald as Kratos.

I definitely reccomend speeding through this game and not bothering with any side quests. This is a huge shame as there a many and they appear lovingly crafted. There are even multiple modes of play including an infinite mode which I assume is to increase the games replayability. Sadly, I have no desire to ever try any of these. 

Basic combat and stealth are about the most interesting fighting mechanics in the game. At least there three kinds of monsters that change up combat a bit. My largest gripe is that any serious boss battles are either the exact same fights as always or simply turn into a press or mash the right button to win type affair... The game seems designed to coddle you and tell you you're awesome rather than introduce difficulty or pain.

As you level up you get tons of kickass ablities... that make the game so much of a cakewalk that perhaps it's better to not try to level much. There's also all of the neat mechanics which surround inserting your own agents into Sauron's army and instigating riots and power struggles. This sounds amazing and is a super cool idea; however, it just means more of the same fights over and over again.

Shadow of Mordor lacks both depth and challenge and thus any feeling of accomplishment. It's a fun beat 'em up game, with pretty cutscenes and graphics and voicovers, in the Tolkein universe. That definitely made it worth the $4 I nabbed it on sale for, but I'd definitely not reccomend it to anyone.

Movement and camera angles will sometimes get you into a corner or a very small ledge you cant jump off of when surrounded on said ledge by a massive horde of enemies. 2. while combos are nice and pressing space to dodge ranged enemies can be fun in small scale, in big scale where i am surrounded by a massive horde with 5 archers on the roof i am forced to do a few hits before vaulting over an enemy to dodge the ranged attacks then i will normally have to block an infantry units attack or several which you have to rightclick for each attack that is simultaneous and then there are also some sheild guys which you cant parry their attack you have to press space and move in the direction you want to roll to. all of these things usually tend to have me do them but the game slowly not able to process them in the order i pressed them in or me pressing space will roll into the enemies etc.

other then those 2 things that seems to persist in other games now(?!) then it is an amazing game. much like ive said to friends when i used to do xbox assasins creed, it is fun but a few mechanics will drive you crazy. also, this game doesnt have a difficulty meter so i cant just like change the difficulty for a few randomly tough missions so i can get on with the story not that im only for the story but sometimes i'd rather not do a quest more then 5 times to progress."

1330,3,0.3972,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","One of the most repetitive and boring games.

If you like assassin's creed system with towers, which grant access to the map, and new Batman Games' fighting mechanics, then this is certainly a game made just for you! Otherwise, here are some things from my experience which make me strongly recommend NOT to waste your time on this.

First of all, the protagonist(s). The creators tried to pull the same trick as The Last of Us: in the very first scene of the game (so no spoilers here) we watch our hero lose his beloved ones, hence we have to empathize with him from now on. Sorry, nope. The character is boring, his voice is monotonous and his motivation is simply ""revenge!!1"" I don't care and don't want to. Thanks to that, the whole story falls short and feels uninspired.

Secondly, fighting mechanics. Yes, they are exactly like in the Batman games, but oh gosh they don't fit here. In DMC or any other slasher where you are playing as a one-man-army hero against legions of evil, you have power-attacks and combos which allow you to stop the pressure from superior (in number) enemy forces. Moreover, usually games start with a few enemies and proceed to challenge you with their increasing numbers and strengths. Here, you're welcome to fight against hundreds of orcs(or uruks, I don't care) from the first second and are expected to succeed without any sort of AoE attacks. Later, of course, you get some kind of AoE, but even then it won't help much. 

Moving further, fantastic (sarcasm) climbing and stealth mechanics! I mention them in the same paragraph, because they're both bastard children of Monolith not being sure if they are making Assassin's Creed in Mordor or Batman in Mordor. As a result, camera behavior during your climbing efforts will leave you scratching your head until you get enraged with the protagonist trying to climb something instead of jumping over a boss you have been trying to hit for the last five minutes(same button on the controller, dunno about the keyboard). Stealth is kind of redundant. You get a bow that one-shots orcs with headshot and you get bushes, which make you some sort of invisible, but both of these are useless most of the time: poor Orcs are absolutely blind and won't notice you until you bring your butt straight to their faces.

4: Orc chess or something. Orc Captains (bosses) are a fun feature, which makes the game stand out from the others. At first. Later you get bored with Orcs resurrecting to terrorize you again, with them grouping into bunches of two or three, which makes fighting them a 30-minute long battle against boredom. A lot of people told me that helping you're orc rise in ranks is a very pleasing experience, but the first orc that we help is revolting and useless. I still don't get why we sought his help. 

5: Collectibles. Spinning a dead crow around the screen to find a glowing blue dot that will trigger PTSD (memories) of a Kaspar spirit leaving inside my body is the most stupid thing I have ever done. 

6: Repetitiveness. It is the sole reason that I'm writing this review. I have played for 13 hours, collecting herbs/artifacts, killing orcs and helping a useless piece of dirt calling itself Ratbag just to find out that I am about to move to a new map area and continue doing the same exact things! Wow, what a twist! 

From my point of view, you have to either love the LotR universe with every cell of your body, or be willing enough to ignore an astounding amount of poor design decisions present in this game."

Overall, the experience even out of the game seems very shallow and possibly even more repetitive than Mad Max.  Even the story missions are just wrappers around stabbing orcs in the face.  In a open world game like this I think there really needs to be more depth and variety as just one hour in the game started to feel really boring once you get the combat system down.

I see comparisons to AC but honestly, I think there is alot more variety in something like Black Flag or Origins than this title.  Ohh - also you can't adjust the FOV which makes the repetitive game play even worse."

To be fair, this is a review of WBPlay.  I've had the game installed for about 38 hours and haven't played it yet.  The reason for this is some sort of rune is offered when I link my WBPlay account.  Great, I'll just create that, link the account, and then we're off to the races.  Wrong.  Created the WBPlay account.  They want me to verify the account by email.  Fine, jumped through that hoop many times with other games, I'm sure it's useful, etc.  Verification email never arrives.  Not to my inbox folder, junk folder, any folder.  Keep trying, keep getting null result.  Wading through their forums, I come across others that have had this issue over the past few years, one person saying it took 18 DAYS for the verification email(s) to arrive.  Contacted support, their first inclination was to point the finger at user error, suggesting I might have mixed up email adresses, as if I had forgotten the email I used less than two days ago.  And then had me change my password, to confirm those emails were coming through.  (Spoiler alert, they arrived quickly and cleanly) 
 Typical, blame anyone else except themselves.  I could absolutely fire up the game right now and play it, but I refuse to if WBPlay won't allow me to link my account. Dodgy first impression.

On the positive side, the graphics are pretty good, the animations are great, and the combat can be fun for a little while, although it's overly easy even when you disable prompts.

- The nemesis system is cool at first, but ultimately extremely repetitive and shallow.

The game isn't bad per se, but it feels more like an OK/average game with a bit of wasted potential to me.

Let's get to the good stuff first:
The production values are amazing, graphics and  sound bring the world of Middle Earth to life and special praise must go to the Orcs with their glorious personalities and quirky accents. The world is vast and gives a lot of opportunities to approach your targets in various ways, stealthy or otherwise, causing mayhem on your path and doing some really cool acrobatics while running around Orc fortresses and stabbing them using an Batman/Arkham style of fighting. The endless hunts of dastardly orc mooks or their warlords never gets old...

...until it does!

And that's where part of the criticism goes. 
The game feels a bit too repetitive, slaying orc after orc, and soon the satisfaction turns to boredom as you never feel you've made a lot of progression (soon the slain orcs will be replaced with other random mooks, perhaps it would be a more satisfying experience to slowly empty their ranks until you realize you became the ultimate orc slayer) and after the initial stages, your character soon becomes overpowered. 

That power results into making the very interesting idea of the Nemesis system never really getting a chance to shine, as I barely got attached to any orc - most of them never lived too long to have any interesting encounter except a specific random dude whom i kept killing again and again only to mysteriously reappear alive and well without explanation and having his face becoming more of a pulp in each encounter. At first it was funny but after a while it was becoming annoying as it happened too often in the middle of important battles and broke the flow of my current quest.

The world also soon becomes a bit uninteresting with the barren landscapes that do not offer too much variation especially in the first half of the game.

Storywise it's not the best, and the main hero is a quite uninteresting fellow who couldn't make me feel attached to his quest for  revenge which is a pity because revenge stories are usually one of my favorite genres. The most dissapointing part though must be the [spoiler] Final Boss of the game featuring the laziest, lamest and unispired QTE ever, where after a ton of battles against some nasty orcs, you just end up with literally PRESS ""E""TO KILL THE BOSS without the slightest bit of effort.[/spoiler] 

Perhaps the game would have benefited if it was a shorter more linear and focused experience instead of the ambitious longer than necessary open world thing it is.

It is fun but the fun part should have lasted a bit.... less. 

Again, if you are a LOTR fan, you like open worlds and killing orcs by the dozens then perhaps make this a thumbs up!"

The nemesis system declared one orc my nemesis, and he kept respawning after I'd killed him when I was fighting random orcs.  I understand that for some the novelty might break up the tedium of button mashing the same orcs over and over, but you kill so many of these captain/named orcs that I was hardly paying attention to their names.

I have no idea why this is selling itself as an open world game, you can run from one side of the world (the world is some ruins, a quarry and some orc huts, same climate same elevation same flora same fauna) to the other in ten minutes, and there is even quick travel if that seems too strenuous.  I kinda wanted to keep going to find out the story, but I was really dragging my feet just a few hours in because the world is so dull and the combat is so tedious."

The concept idea is great and the system is quite nuanced but no one seems to have thought what to do with it. The game has thougher captain and warlord enemies that have unique strenghts and weaknessess that develop based on your encounters but it doesn't matter much if every encounter leads to bosses demise.

I heard so much about this stupid nemisis system. It was being touted as a great innovation in gaming. Well what a crock of shit that was lol. So lets say some orc just killed you, well now hes gotten stronger than he was before! But wait a second, why did he kill you? Was it him being somehow better or more memorable than the sea of 300 billion orcs you just killed? NO! It was due to the fact that you had just taken out 300 billion orcs and as it happens your limit is 300 billion and 1. 

Ok, so the fight where he killed you isnt memorable at all. What about after he ""powers up?"" HAHAHAHA, its still the same fucking battle over and over and over again. You know what the difference is? This time hes just flat out immune to sneak attacks and ranged attacks. Whats that? You killed him in 3 seconds anyway? Oh... well so much for my nemisis.

That i think, is my major issue with this game. People talk about this nemisis system all day long but fail to mention how since the actually battles between you and the orcs are so grindy and boring that its meaningless who the bag of meat is in front of you. 

Outside of the combat, all you have left to do is meaningless collectables. FUN FUN FUN! I think this game is a great example of what people think a good game is if they never get outside of call of duty or the next fooseball game.

It should be mentioned that I dont know a damn thing about LOR history or lore and couldnt care less about the story or characters. Ratbag was mildly funny though and probably my favorite character."

1.Great Combat System
2.Great Atmosphere and Setting
3. Uruk banter is the greatest thing to eavesdrop on, hands down.
4. Some of the unlockable abilities are interesting and completely change how you approach the game. 

Cons: 
1.What is with all the bloody tutorials? I played the game for 3 hours and I am still being bombarded repeatedly by tutorials and prompts for tasks I have already performed doezens of times. 
2. Quick Time events... every time you get downed there is this annoying quick time event that is suppose to act as a last chance mechanic, but ultimately rips me out of any immersion I had through the overpopulated UI. 
3. There are key promps for everything! I am not fighting in a game, I am reacting to flashing user interface prompts like a robot. I unlock a skill that gives me a speed boost for pressing A after hopping over a rock, the game ensures you never forget this because for the rest of the game a gaint green A button is on your screen 50% of the time after that. I am not an idiot. I read what I unlocked. 
4. All this random zoom-in-listen-to-me moments during a battle! Why? It just completely ruins the pace of the game and rips me out of the experience. 
5. Every side quest is a glorified fetch quest to put progress on a bar towards your next upgrade.
6. All the different progress bars for upgrades. First, there is a currency system for gear upgrades. Second, there is an xp system for skill points you can put towards upgrades but you can't just progress neatly down a branch or two because you need to also level up your ""Power Level"" to unlock the different levels of the branches, ultimately limiting your choices to 8 at a time. I can't customize my Talion to be unique to my playstyle because I will have more than enough skill points to unlock the first 8 by the time I unlock the next level of upgrades. It ruins an otherwise great skill tree and forces players to trudge through generic repetitive quests for progress on one of the 3 progress bars they need to grind to get what they want.

The game is great, but the experience is ruined by over-zealous tutorial prompts, needless combat interuptions and flashing billboard UI elements crowding my screen. It is jarring and immersion breaking. I can't recommend this game."

I bought into the hype of it not too long ago from now, knowing it was a ""Classic"" that people seemed to genuinely enjoy.

I'm thrusted into this place with little or no direction, and once I figure out maybe where I'm going, I was consistantly getting murdered in what -felt like- initially easy fights, because I'd get overwhelmed by crowds of creatures while fighting something that has amazing accuracy out of nowhere.

My main issue is the hype built around this game.  I'm sure if I kept playing I'd find things I'd like and get the hang of it relatively fast.  However, I don't think it needs to be as revered as a modern classic as some people seem to think it is.  I think it's slightly different enough in it's enemy system that it keeps it interesting...

*I've played this before on console, only spent an hour in the PC version, hence the short playtime.

While not a bad game, not for me. They tried to make a gritty, action-focused Lord of the Rings game and succeeded. Combat however is annoying at times and repetitive despite the power-ups and executions, like most hack-and-slash games to me (think of this as an Assassin's Creed game in Middle-Earth). The story is a bit lame, minimal and doesn't feel connected to the Lord of the Rings universe. While gameplay and graphical presentation are good (human models look a bit generic and borderline cartoonish) they also made things unnecesarily confusing at first and are constantly throwing in all of the tutorials and features of the game (and there are many) at you all at once. On top of that things are just happening way too fast between the story and cinematics and trying to throw you right in the middle of the action, I feel like a first-time player would be very thrown off.
Again, not a bad game but don't expect a ground-breaking new experience or anything captivating the Lord of the Rings universe (though sadly no LOTR game has really done this so far)."

The combat system is clunky and unsatisfying. Problem is, hacking orcs into pieces is the other focus of this game.

I just beat the main story with all side quests in Udun in 13 hours. This is just silly, how rushed and unfinished this game feels without its DLCs.

The game feels horribly easy. I actually started handicapping myself by not buying any non-storyline related upgrades once the story took me to Nurn in an effort to make this game a little less childishly easy.

The [b]foul ups[/b] at Monolith/Ubisoft decided it was a good idea to put in game advertisments in the pause menu screen. You pause the game, you get a never ending ad banner trying to sell you their products. I paid full price for this game and should never be subjected to ads. This is poor form, and sours me heavily on any future endeavour by this pairing. For shame.

[h1]Gameplay issues[/h1]
The game itself is deeply flawed (for me, you might love it)
[*]The controls are too contextual, so you go to perform an action and end up performing something unintended. Think of the free running of Assassin's Creed if you want to understand how frustrating this is. 
[*]The player moves unlike an action game and more like an adventure game. It's trying really hard to emulate Batman from the Arkham games, but does it poorly. For the first bit, it's faster to stealth walk than to walk. 
[*]The aiming for the arrows is way too sensitive (playing with Xbox controller), it barely works even if you set it on the lowest setting. This isn't a PEBKAC issue, I play plenty of shooters on the controllers and KB+M. This was just poorly done. 
[*]The main character is a sadist. While it is supposed to be a tale of revenge, in this game you're essentially carrying out petty revenge on unwitting sentient orcs. Sure orcs are evil, but Mordor is [i]their[/i] homeland, not Gondors. The only reason we play from this perspective is due to us being human. The game can make you feel really gross at time due to poor morality. You're no hero. 
[*]Dated graphics. Seriously, this game is from 2014 and should look halfway decent. It doesn't, my very modest rig crushes it on max settings smooth 60fps. It looks like a much older game from 2009 or before.
[*]In addition to my issue with in game ads, the start up videos are heavier in quantity than most games, and difficult to disable due to how Steam runs it's updates. 
[*]I know orcs are stupid, but in this game, they are [i]stupid[/i]. You can kill an orc right next to another and he may not notice, even if they are talking and providing flavour text. The AI is terrible. I was able to kill a Captain without him ever noticing me, only using arrows. He just stood there and took shot after shot.
[*]The in game speech is faint and hard to hear, and comes from everywhere. Despite that, often orcs could be several hundred feet away but sound like they are right next to you. If they are vertically far, the game treats them like they are horizontally near. AKA, if you're 50 metres above an enemy, the game treats it like you're standing right next to him and not, you know, 50 metres away like it would if they were that distant on a horizontal plane.
[*]The game has a terrible intro. You're thrust awkwardly into the game not knowing your butt from a hole in the ground and rely too much on the in game index to learn the setting. You have almost no insight into what happened, nor who killed you in the intro. Further to this issue, right when you think you're getting the hang of something, you get pop up tutorials that pause the game and want you to do something unrelated to what you're trying to do. It's maddening. 
[*]Right at the start of the game, all the orcs seem to know who you are and speak about you like you've been enemies for years. It pulls you out of the experience since they are just grunts. It makes the game feel like they skipped an entire portion that would ease you into the game play and just dumps you into this world.

I did not like this game. You might, as it's popular and people like it and it apparently warranted a sequel, but I draw the line at full price games with in game ads and poor controls. For me, it's just not fun, it was frustrating work with no point.

Buy at your own risk."

Why can’t you play this as a proper stealth game?  Why do they insist on spawning in 3 other generals if your fight with one lasts more than 30 seconds?

Long Version:

I enjoyed the game but the overwhelmingly positive reviews are more a result of a thumbs up or thumbs down rating system. Not a reflection of how great the game is itself- Most of my gripes are with the story itself, some gameplay issues. Here they are. **spolier alert**

Story issues:

 -you spend a number of story missions helping an orc named ratbag get promoted to warchief. The idea being you have a war chief that you can influence. But it was a total waste because ratbag is quickly defeated and you end up just mind controlling all of the war chiefs anyways

-There are a few story missions involving a dwarf. These writing for these missions is a total failure. even though you are half elf there is no animosity between the elf and the dwarf which seems like a big miss. At one point the dwarf tells a really long story about how the Caragor creature HATES water to the point of becoming uncrollable. moments later you and the dwarf ride caragors through water with no problems.... The basic arc of the dwarf story is that you are learning how to kill a giant creature. However, all of the techniques he teaches you are pointless because in the final mission with him, things dont go as planned and you never use a single technique you learned in the last 3 missions. 

-you collect 32 items to finish the image of a secret elf door (like the one gandlaf has to remember the password for) but nothing happens. all you did was complete the image. Its not actually a door and it does nothing.

-one cut scene shows your elf half having the ring of power in his possesion at the start of the war that is depicted in the prolouge of the fellowship of the ring movie....idk where that came from. 

-the entire morrdor map is full of slaves to the orcs- called outcasts, they are men throw out of gondor. They serve absolutely no purpose in the game.

GAMEPLAY issues

- nemis system is interesting but never amounts to anything. Every enemy can be pretty easily defeated no matter what rank or stengths and weaknesses. Meeting a character more than once through the nemisis system has no real impact on gameplay beyond a new phrase being said during a cutscene. 

-as you work you way up from low level orcs all the way to the black hand of sauron the difficulty stays the same. Defeating the black hand of sauron really only took a few button taps during a mostly controlled cinematic fight scene.

- it is not an open world map, it is basically like mario 64. There is a large map but that just means you have to walk across empty terrain to be able to start your next mission. 



There are more issues but thats the idea, 

Strengths: it is always great to be back in middle earth and in this cae that makes up for any of the games short comings. Get it on sale if you are going to get it."

The nemesis is fun for like 10 min then its just repetive combat ov er and over."
1408,3,0.4349,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well",This game is mechanically well done as far as the in game world. However Gameplay is exactly the same as assassins creed and batman. The story which is sadly why I mistakenly bought this game is lack luster at best and at worst just plain lore breaking They had a chance to make one of the if not the greatest games of all time and they OOOOFFFFFFEEEEEDDDDD it hard. Playable yes Enjoyable only if you like swinging a sword blocking when the Icon appears then swinging your sword some more. Stealth is well done however It's not reliable enough you can't kill everything from stealth and sometimes people will spot you through walls. The games ending is its biggest flop about to fight the big bad boss and suddenly QTE and the game ends like what the fuck that was your big fight the other fights I at least got to swing my sword on my own.
1409,3,0.9013,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I was promised a great experience with this game. The game's not bad, it's actually fun. For a few hours. Just like most open-world productions, the game feels redundant after a while. It's basically an Assassin's Creed with Batman Arkham's combat style thrown in (which is really good, by the way, and it's properly executed and flashy as hell). But unlike the latter, it feels really, really repetitive more like the former. The main character has no charisma, in a videogame where there aren't really many characters to begin with. The lore is good, especially to those who love to explore every nook and cranny of Tolkien's Middle-Earth.

Nemesis system is a nice addition to a game which feels like we've played elsewhere, many times, but it doesn't hold the title up by itself because, again, it ends up feeling repetitive. Again, the game isn't bad, but in my humble opinion, it's extremely overrated, and it's something you might enjoy if you get it for sale, like I did. 

The verdict is a 6/10, barely above average, though if you ARE a hardcore fan of The Lord of the Rings, the value of the game might be increased exponentially, if you're willing to read every bit of lore the game gives you. Sadly, I'm not that much of a fan of it, and I'm reviewing it as a videogame solely."

1413,4,0.4066,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","I thought I'd be playing a classic because of the positivity of the reviews.
The game started out awesome, lots of good features, but I was quickly and brutally disappointed very soon.

SFX and graphics are pretty good I think, especially because it's a console port. Very fast loading which is great for this genre.
Atmosphere is decent enough, but walking through Mordor freely is a bit weird... although I don't know too much about LOTR.
Which is why I don't discuss story in the LOTR universe. The story as a standalone is pretty cliché at every turn, but I wouldn't give minus points for it.
The characters feel real enough. They're nothing special, but they aren't forced on you either, which I can appreciate.

The nemesis system is quite creative, I'm happy to see new features like that especially in supposed AAA games.
Killing orcs is satisfying and never feels too much.


[b]Sadly all this goodness is overshadowed by the buggy, broken, inconsistent gameplay.[/b]


Even after a few hours it's painfully obvious how terrible the controls are.

Your character will often stop near walls instead of climbing them or running next to them.
This is partly because climbing and running are assigned to the same key, and partly because the way the game determines your movement direction is extremely inconsistent.
In this game you'll never need true sneaking: you can run into an uruk from the front and can still perform a stealth kill, therefore sneaking alongside walls is ultimately useless.

Directional climbing and directional jumping are severely limited, not allowing you otherwise trivial movement.

The game has a really hard time distinguishing between ""dodging"" and ""vault over enemy"", which is bad during most fights, but a torture while fighitng a boss that can't be vaulted over.

During quick time events inputs are often disregarded.
It gets even worse when you're fighting big groups - you know, when QTEs are a matter of life and death - where 25-30% of the QTEs are forfeit because the game just refuses to register the keystrokes.

There's also a last stand QTE which doesn't trigger half the time and you just get auto-killed for whatever reason.
It seems like the game takes your last input much before the QTE animation event starts.

When there are lots of small, descending steps following eachother your character will jump-stop-jump-stop-jump-stop.
It's not a serious problem by itself of course, just an example of how little thought went into the game engine/map design, even though it should've been made for parkour.

Combat and exploration are the heart of the gameplay.
They're outdated and/or broken. I've had smoother gameplay in the first Assassin's Creed.


But I'll continue since the problems don't end there.


Can't lock onto enemies, meaning your attacks and abilities just go every which way, even if you have an important target.

Your camera is often force-turned into another direction even during fights.

You can't restart missions. Not main quests, not sidequests.
You can replay them if you failed of course, but if you want to restart because you missed the bonues objective, well... you just have to start a new campaign.

If you abandon a sidequest you'll be magically teleported to the closest forge tower which can be a 1000 ft away from the mission you want to replay.
Running through Mordor will stop being fun pretty fast.

You can't fast travel to sidequests and quests, even if you're repeating them.

Unskippable cutscenes waste your time on almost every captain encounter. Possibly stopping your executions and abilites to go off, sometimes resetting your hit streaks.
This is unnecessary and annoying by itself, but especially a problem when you find a challenging captain that you can't kill on first try.
And torture while you're trying to do the trials (these are highly repetitive challenges that can require from a few /many tries to do, depending on player).

If you're already in pursuit of a captain and run into another then the cutscene can allow the chased one to escape.

Captains can randomly disappear, nullifying all your progress on them during that encounter.
The most extreme case was when a captain ran behind a wall, about 10 feet/5 meters away from me, I was looking at his direction when the despawn happened.

After killing captains in strongholds the alarm have likely been raised, so you're surrounded by enemies, making it impossible to pick up the rune they drop, forcing an unnessecary trip away and back so the uruks despawn.
There's no reason whatsoever that runes are not picked up automatically.

After the captain cutscene the game will resume a bit before you gain control of your character, or even see anything, forcing you to take a hit if you're in close combat. During this time some captains/warchiefs will kill you in 1 hit, allowing captains to escape possibly resetting your mission.


Neither one of these would be a problem by itself.
The game is quite casual, trivial and easily exploited so my problem with these issue is not that they made the game difficult, but the fact that they completely go against common sense and/or break immersion/gameplay.
Of course these might not bother you, and obiously there are lots of problems that I anticipated and worked around, since it's not my first console port.

The overall effect of the awesomeness and buginess of the game was that I mostly felt a relief after completing a mission and very rarely felt genuine achievement or acoomplishment."

1420,3,0.6541,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","When this game was released it received a lot of critical acclaim with people citing that this was the license game that didn't suck. What a load of rubbish.
This games basic mechanics are lifted straight from assassins creed. There’s the basic attack, counter stun combat from the Batman Arkham games and of course assassins creed. There’s also the simplistic stealth from both too. The combat is just boring as there is no challenge (I even turned off the counter indicator and the game was still easy) and because there is no variety. There are four types of orcs you fight and of those 80% of the time it will just be the normal type. This means that combat is very repetitive. The stealth is stupidly easy. Enemy orcs can’t spot you beyond 8 metres eliminating any challenge whatsoever. I also wonder why stealth is in this game at all. In Batman Arkham games stealth makes sense as you die fast from armed enemies. In AC you’re an assassin so being stealthy makes sense. But why should Talion go stealth? The enemies are weak and it’s not like his character is supposed to be sneaky within the story. It makes no sense. The one innovation in the gameplay is nemesis system. The idea is great, you kill the orcs in Saurons army to prevent them from becoming more powerful. The orc officers all have their own personalities and strengths and weaknesses, making them interesting to deal with. If you are killed by an orc he will gain power and so forth. Initially it’s fun to hunt out the orcs in the randomly generated missions. But eventually you realise that no matter how many you kill more will inevitably get promoted and trying to take them all out is aimless as when you eventually die your progress killing through them all is lost.  
So the gameplay isn’t very good. That leaves the slack it leaves to be picked up by the story. The AC and Arkham games have ok stories which make their simplistic gameplay bearable. The story in this game is terrible. Five minutes into the game Talion’s, the player’s character, wife and son die. There is an immediate disconnect between the player and the character. I don’t care less about Talion’s wife and son so their death has no impact. This is already a pretty cliché plot device but what’s even worse is that in the game Talion doesn’t seem to care either. He never really talks about their deaths or if he feels sad or not. The story just continues, forgetting this. The rest of the story is an absolute snorefest. No one in the game has a shard of personality. Is it too ironic that randomly generated orcs have more personality than the characters of the main story? The wraith comes across as a dick, he just says things about the impending doom and how humans suck and whatnot. The only mildly interesting character is Torvin, the dwarf hunter. He’s the only character with any real arc and his making fun of Talion is the only interesting thing in the entire plot. But after 4 missions he’s gone. The story is non canon for LOTR as well, so forget about learning some new interesting side to the lore or anything. Oh and I can’t forget Gollum’s horribly shoehorned cameo either. The story in this game is just abysmal. 
The games presentation is pretty good. The visual design captures the look of the LOTR movies well. The graphics are good, characters are modelled well and textures are pretty good. The game sound effects are ok. They do their job well enough, not really worthy of praise though. The voice actors may be voicing boring characters but they perform fine. The only real complaint I have about the games presentation is the pre rendered cut scenes. Pre rendered cut scenes always have and always will look crap. The game also has fast loading times which is nice and surprising considering how new it is. The animations look great. The combat may be bad but it looks cool with nice visceral attacks. It’s funny to see the orcs heads rolling around after they have been lobbed off. 
This games presentation can’t save it though. A boring story and mediocre gameplay make this game painfully average. The nemesis system was the selling point of this game but one good idea in a sea of terrible and rehashed ones isn’t a compelling game. Even if the game is heavily discounted there are much better ways to spend your money and time than this game."

1422,3,0.3644,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Pros:

- Good combat.  When the game is working it does a good job of making you feel like you are becoming stronger until you can take on hordes of enemies and come out alive.

- Challenging quests that don't feel too repetitive, making the leveling system feel at least a little more organic than your typical action RPG.

- Interesting lore.  I think it was very smart to pick important but less familiar characters like Celebrimbor to include.

- Gorgeous landscapes and weather.

- Excellent use of sound.

- Excellent controller support.

Cons:

- This game crashes on the  regular.  I'm running an 8700k and a 1080ti.  I probably spent three or four hours trying to get to run in a more stable fashion - vsync on/off, underclock GPU (yes really, this was suggested by WB Games), tessellation on/off, newer/older drivers, fullscreen/borderless/windowed, etc etc.  Eventually I found a combination of settings that lets me play more than 10 mins, but I can still count on it to crash every two hours or so.  You can imagine this doesn't pair well with the ""challenging quests"" point above.  Can't count how many times I was nearing the end of a quest only to have the game crash again.  And based on what I've seen on the support forums, everyone needs to find their own combination of settings based on their hardware to get it running *somewhat* well.  I can verify this personally as my secondary desktop uses a Haswell i5 and an R9 390.  Requires different settings to get it stable, and still crashes fairly often. 

-  Bungled controls.  At first I loved the huge moveset this game has.  Unfortunately this eventually makes it nearly impossible to execute the intended action unless you are aligned juuuust right with the object you are trying to interact with.  Try climbing a wall only to watch your character roll away or drop down instead.  This problem impacts the midgame moveset the most, particularly mounting beasts until late game when you get a new skill that circumvents the whole thing.

-  Bugs.  One of the bigger ones I encountered was how the game would hitch fairly severely after cutscenes.  This is a bit of a problem since you are often thrown into the middle of the action while your FPS tanks for 5 or 6 seconds at the start of nearly every mission.  Died a few times thanks to that.  Another is that it seems you can't shoot arrows between gaps in fences, walls, etc even though enemies can spot you through them.  It seems that even the (large) gaps are all one part of the asset and your arrow just appears to stop mid-air.

- FPS capped to 100 max, no workaround to go higher.

Conclusion:  I definitely can see why this game got decent reviews from other people.  It's one of the better action RPGs I've played recently, and the 'super human fights hordes of enemies' theme works particularly well with the Uruks of Mordor, giving the game decent immersion.  Unfortunately, I've spent about as much time troubleshooting issues as I have just enjoying the gameplay/dealing with botched controls.  I don't think I've seen a game this unstable since Fallout 3 or the original Witcher.  As a result I can't recommend this game at full price.  It does go on sale regularly though, so maybe consider picking it up if you have the patience to fine tune it."

So much emphasis has been put on making it to look cinematic (with twisting camera angles, random slow motion and unexpected special movement elements), that it actually forgot to remain a game. After only 2 hours I’m already throroughly fed up with it, and I’m not sure if it will receive a second chance. The world itself is made beautifully, and I’m sure with practice and some tweaking one can get used to it the chaotic controls, the jerky set up (who you are, where you are, what are you set out to do, and so on), but after a useless (but again, very pretty and cinematic) tutorial there is little to no clarity about menus, powers, structure, purpose or anything else for that matter. You just start somewhere, set out to do something, somehow, to someone, and that’s it (and I guess it will get gradually clearer later - No thanks).

Unless you are fanatic about Middle Earth, or somehow familiar with the game structure and or controls, I can not recommend it, at all (despite its looks and atmosphere).

The story can be completed in just 3-4hrs so to me personally this game dont offer anything other than just braindead gameplay, seem lazy and unimaginative. But if you just want to slay orcs and chill this is a fair game for you I guess.

edit: There are also stealth gameplay in it which makes the game even easier, you are as good as invisible if you stealth in front of their face a small distance away which dont feel right at all.

1441,3,0.6679,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Even with the sale price I don't recommend this game. I had heard a lot of good things about Shadow of Mordor and I was excited to play but I feel let down. First off, I was extremely disappointed in the open world environment. It looked very artificial with big plateaus and vertical walls everywhere. There’s not much foliage or trees even in the second map. It just all feels mashed together for some reason. I know you can climb walls just like Assassins Creed and that adds some dimension to the map but it feels overused. You can crouch in these vary obvious grass areas that make you “invisible” but it just doesn’t feel immersive at all with your head popping out from the grass.
The nemesis system is awesome and a great idea. They also did a great job with the variety of Orc’s and the voice acting is top notch. The fighting system is fun and fluid and is basically the same as the Batman games. It can feel very satisfying to use your sword to chop an Orc’s head off using an execution move after landing a series of combo’s. However, the fighting can feel very frantic at times and its not uncommon to have a roving Orc group come upon your fight and now you have a dozen Orc’s you have to fight along with multiple generals. When I first started the game, I was spotted by some general and his orc’s and when I tried to flee I just ran into another group…and anther…and another. Next thing I know I have like 30 Orc’s and 4 generals all pursuing me. I of course die but now all these Orcs get some new buffs and added ranking because they defeated me? I don’t think this is so much the systems fault as it is the small, condensed maps fault. It feels like Orc suburbia, and each Orc group has their own little ¼ acre plot next to their orc neighbor. 

The story in Shadow of Mordor feels disjointed and lacking. I didn’t finish the game so I can’t really comment on the ending but the story just never really grabbed me or seemed to have much purpose. It just felt like your supposed to go out and destroy a bunch of Orcs. I’m not a huge LOTR fan so maybe I’m missing something. 
So outside of the combat and nemesis system, I really feel like the game doesn’t offer a whole lot else. The first map really killed it for me as well. I Just didn’t like the way the environment looked and the way the orc camps and ruins were laid out. Maybe the game got a lot better as you get into the later stages but I just couldn’t keep playing. 

THE GOOD
•	Nemesis system
•	Fun combat (mostly)
•	Orc and character models look awesome
•	Great voice acting
•	RPG elements

THE BAD
•	Bad map/environment design
•	Lack of story or desire to follow story
•	Chaotic fights at times
•	Combat can feel repetitive
•	Doesn’t really feel that open

1444,3,0.5212,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","In my optionion a soul-less game that tries to save itself with fanservice to the LotR fans and nicely choreographed, Batman Arkham-style combat.
While I liked that the combat was more tactical than instantaneous blow-by-blow clicking, even there it falls short with its QTE-style action pprompts which at the same time server as a tutorial. While combat in general works wel, dodging beasts and special attacks is poorly explained and feel hit-or-miss.
Often times you feel although the combat looked cool and you won you weren't in controll of much of it. Most of the time button mashing suffices but a fruistrating moments it doesn't (dodging).

The environment is rather bland in short distances but the atmosphere of sneaking and fighting in an Ork-occupied land or rear of an Ork army is well done.

While I ultimately dropped the game because of the poor dodge system the low point of the game is how the story is presented. Overall the story might be quite good - I haven't gotten far - but in the beginning the story get's trown into the players face with barely any introduction of characters (just feeding of LotR lore) and within a few minutes you are confronted with the ""Unnamed villans and the ork murdered your wife and son, destroyed everything your 60-seconds-character lieved for and killed him, too.

1450,3,0.4144,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","(Good game, declining port. My review was formerly positive. I've started encountering issues years into owning it.)

I first played this on PS3, which is without a doubt one of the worst versions of this game due to visual quality and long loading times. At first it just felt like a generic Batman/Assassin's Creed rip-off with Lord of the Rings slapped on. Not to say that the gameplay was bad, but it was nothing to write home about. It took finishing the first land (of two, the second being somewhat longer) for me to love this game. I am so glad I toughed it out, because this is one of my favorite games. I've played it numerous times on PS3 and even beat it once on PC that wasn't my own.

Unfortunately after playing the PC version, I could no longer go back and play the PS3 version. Its flaws show pretty heavily. But this review isn't about that.

Later in the game, you gain access to a unique army-building mechanic that tacks onto the already-established army-assassinating mechanic (the Nemesis System, as it's called). On their own, neither is too special unless you have an interest in them, but together they make for a very fun game. I always recommend people at least make progress on the second land before giving up on the game if they aren't enjoying it, because I personally went from ""bored"" to ""in love"" after I started recruiting at the second stage of the game.

With how cheap this game gets, I highly recommend it. The second game has its problems with microtransactions, but this game is free of that and WELL worth paying for. I bought it for $14 and it was a great deal. You can get it as low as $4 sometimes on Steam, full GOTY version. If this game looks even a tiny bit interesting to you, give it a try.

------------------

I love this game and while Shadow of War eclipses it by a fair degree in terms of gameplay and design, I still recommend it to anyone on the edge who might be considering the series. However, it's starting to have more issues the more I update my hardware. Last time I installed and played it, I couldn't even play the Bright Lord DLC. A small piece of DLC that's unnecessary for the plot, but still something I paid for and expect to be able to play, yet the menu treated it as if it was uninstalled/un-owned and there was absolutely no way around it to get it working.

That's a problem. I want to know my game is going to keep working when I buy it. Now I have to pick up a copy on consoles if I want a reliable copy that won't change and that pretty much limits me to PS4 because the PS3 version is lazy backwards-ported garbage."
1451,3,0.7441,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","In general, I cannot recommend this game. The story is annoyingly dull and unfaithful to Tolkien's work; so are the new monsters and villains. The gameplay is sort of like a mixture of Assassin's creed (including the somewhat useless collectible ""quests"") and an action brawler, the main quest line is short and very linear, the game gets way too easy after a few hours of playing, the side quests are repetitive and not at all rewarding. I sometimes caught myself no longer looking at the graphics of the game but just running around staring at the mini-map, because there's almost no obstacle that you cannot just jump over.

The nemesis system, however, is somewhat interesting, and the game somehow manages to keep you playing, even though you've long noticed that it lacks real depth. The fights are fun and sometimes challenging. So all in all, I guess I will play this for a few more hours before I put it aside."

There's two skill trees and collectable runes and THREE different currencies for unlocking all this stuff, and all the powers sound like fun but they don't make that big a difference. There's very little additions to the types of fighting you do. Compared to the Arkham Batman series, which adds interesting features with each new gadget. In Shadow of Mordor they just... don't.

I tried numerous times to execute special moves and powers that I earned/learned with nary a success, mostly because every time I tried to engage a group of enemies I couldn't really attack the enemy I wanted to, so my battle stratagies fell somewhat flat.

The in-game story in nothing more than a disguise for an eighteen hour tutorial showing you the part where the game is designed to shine: its gameplay. Taking inspiration from Assassin's Creed and the Batman Arkham games enough to risk a lawsuit, Shadows of Mordor is a game about running, climbing, fighting orcs in brutal and gory ending ways, using the same elements of the environment to reduce their numbers in ways they never expect, while getting into fights with captains and warchiefs, that get personal provided it's not your first fight. 

The character you'll play as is Talion, Captain of the Rangers, his post being at the gate that defends the men of Gondor from the foul creatures of Mordor. Being a family man, the game starts with Talion showing his son how to fight, the boy seemingly inherited his mother's frame and his father wits, having vulnerability written all over it. Sneaking up on his wife with a flower, it's clear Talion is the kind of man who doesn't have a heart for anyone but his family. To get the story going, the plot's villains pick Talion's post to commit their dark deeds, ensuring that the protagonist will have vengeance to drive him forward in the land no man should walk on. Possessed by a spirit whose identity is revealed later, Talion turns into a gravewalker, unable to die and having nothing to live for. 

The plot-line is paved with potential for a good middle earth story, some characters and reasons for being there being good enough not to skip the cutscenes. Destroying a monument of slave domination, piecing together a wraith's lost memories, helping an orc that easily trips on air to become a warchief, fighting for what a beautiful woman with a cold demeanour wants and going on a hunt with a beardless dwarf that has the charm of his kind in Tolkien's universe, all make for a story that obviously had some love put into its making. Sadly, it's all too short to have a real impact, most of the plot points feeling rushed or an excuse to introduce the player to its mechanics and pushing him into using them in order to continue. Clever design really, as it is the gameplay that's obviously the aspect meant to make Shadows of Mordor memorable. 

As a seasons ranger possessed by the famous Celebrimbor, combat consists of an Arkham style melee, involving frontal attacks that can be directed, evading strong enemies, stunning them, countering attacks and building momentum for special moves, or in this game, finishers. The Wraith side allows for the ranged part, where time can slow down to a crawl before the focus bar depletes, leaving you to shoot arrows in real time. It's something that could have used more work, as most times you'll use ranged attacks from a vantage point where no one knows you're there and shooting your arrow means you should shoot as many others as you can. Unlike the Assassin's Creed games, the stealth mechanic does not attempt to build any illusion of strategy, often charging into enemies and crouching down when close enough to perform stealth finishers.  

Often times you'll hear the orcs talking about you, your progress, or plain gibberish, a small detail that adds to the immersion. Killing a captain will make its followers run from you and being killed by anyone in the ranks will promote their level. The nemesis system can make things personal if you're facing orcs multiple times. Killing captains and warchiefs straight on can make the nemesis system feel non-existent, the only enjoyment their immediate death brings being runes that you can add to your sword, bow or dagger, providing bonuses that can come in handy should you find yourself in a challenging spot. Sometimes captain run of the being exposed to something that frightens them, such as beasts, bees or being close to death. Facing them again would have them swear they'll finish the job this time. Same goes for when they kill you: they get stronger and more confident confronting you, but should you kill them, in their final moments they'll either urge you to finish it, or say how you and them could have joined forces. Despite each captain having their specific strengths and weaknesses, I've never had to consult the chart, being able to adapt on the moment being possible to the low number of things you can actually do in a fight, not to mention that most of the times, captains are close to their vulnerabilities. 

Branding is the mechanic that ensures the player's involvement in the army of uruks, as having soldiers fighting for you, climbing the ranks is something you'll want to ensure for them. Then again, there's nothing stopping you from branding the warchiefs for the story missions and doing how you please with the captains. Climbing the ranks can be done via direct confrontations with their superiors, hunting activities or executions. Vendettas are an online activity, leaving you to kill the orcs that fell those on your friend list. 

The game has a photo mode that's good enough to help you find out if there's a photographer in you. Being able to toggle it by the simple press of a button, you can change the camera position, albeit limited to Talion's position, zoom in/out, adjust the depth of field, chose a filter and its intensity, frames, overlays, and logos regarding the games should you want to include them. While the world of Mordor is barren and feels empty even in the more lush area, actions scenes and most areas can make up for great shots. Frankly, if you love taking screenshots in a game, this could be a selling point on its own, since nothing is too challenging to take the focus away from your photography. 

The reason why I'm not recommending the game is simply because it feels small, limited and that's something its sequel suffers less off, its ailments being a different story. Following an open world formula, the game features two areas that are small on the map and feel just as small when roaming through them. There are good things in this game yet all of them feel inconclusive. It's public knowledge the game's third act was cut out due to the budget constraints and that's something that affected the entire game, as most of it builds towards something that falls short, leaving you to enjoy the nemesis system that doesn't do much for a player that doesn't get killed often and collecting things that you can spot and mark on your map. While the textures are sharper and Talion's cloak has better physics in this game than the next, playing Shadow of Mordor makes me recommend Shadow of War. If you're on the mission to vote with your wallet and you don't want to support Denuvo or the presence of lootboxes in the game but really want to play Shadow of War, than Shadow of Mordor is the purchase that won't break your principles and might be satisfying enough to forget about it for a while, maybe till the sequel is cheap enough to not matter anymore."

The story is not as good as Shadow of War, it doesn't really draw you in. The story does also seem much shorter, like they were in a hurry to finish it. Shadow of War also had a bunch of good boss fights, nothing like this here. Maybe they saved the best for last?

Simply put - I wanted to continue to play Shadow of War, for hours and hours. But Shadow of Mordor? No, I just wanted it to end. The last battle was a huge disappointment, kind of surprised that it has such a good review."

If you looking for shallow and brainless repetitive gameplay then this game have a lot to offer but if you want something more and engaging well this might disappoint you.

They took Lord of the rings with all it's richness, depth, atmosphere and throw it out of the window. This game could be anything really, it doesn't feel like LOTR at all, yes there are orcs, golum and what not but could be anything else and would feel the same but lotr theme would sold much better than almost any newly created world :)

Combat is quite good but after some time it gets very repetitive and tedious. The worst part is that there is no end to fight, you fight one captain or warchief there is big chance there will be endless flow of new orcs coming at you. You can't just kill them all and then that care of capitan and on top of that often when you make your way to dominate captain another one will show up with some bodyguards. 
Another thing is that when you clean camp from all orcs in mission or not, you just turn around and they are all back at it and you can fight them once more :)

Map is tight packed, claustrophobic almost you don't feel there is vast spaces to explore but one point of interest next to another, one collectable next to another and so on. 
Side missions are mostly very generic and repetitive and after couple of them of the same type it is harder and harder to make another one like it, but you must grind some to upgrade you skills and gear. If there only was lootboxes so you can just buy your way out and save some precious time it would be great ;)

Story is weak and main character is boring and forgettable, even Ratbag have more character than him :) 

So if you want some open world midless game to play after work to rlief stress this can be it bue if you are looking for more engaging and mature game look somewhere else like Witcher 3 :)"

The story line of the game is pretty unclear. You just run around killing things over and over again.

The game seems to be ported from a console. The buttons you need to push to make combinations of attacks are too many, too complicated and not smooth enough.

The biggest minor in the game where the endless cutscenes when you meet yet another ""boss"". It really takes the speed out of the game. For you seem to meet them every 20 meters and sometimes you meet them while you are fighting the previous one.

Once you've figured out the combat in the first two hours and can consistently time the necessary button presses after the first five, you could take on every single orc in Middle-earth, since they attack you one at a time, and you can pretty just block-attack-repeat more or less through all the necessary orcs, and if it hadn't been for orcs infinitely re-spawning in camps (Why?! Thanks for making it literally impossible to win if I get caught there, unless I just run.), then you'd win. Easily as well. The final boss fight was way too easy. There's no variation in the combat once you get into it (sure, you can thin out the horde with your bow and arrow, but that's about it.). There's a leveling system, but it doesn't do anything interesting. It just makes the boring repetitive combat a bit easier.

Combat:
--------------------------------------------------
Easy, reptivite, boring.

Non-humanoid enemies do damage that doesn't scale
at all with the rest of the game. They basically 
force you into quick time events that end with you
dying as they're impossible to run
away from. Dodging attacks with the Spacebar from these
enemies is a dice roll. It might work it might not.

Movement:
-------------------------------------------------
Unpolished.
Climbing is terribly clumsy.
Snap to cover seems random, and will often 
ruin stealth kill attempts.

AI:
---------------------------------------------------
Some of the worst I've seen.
They're all nearly blind and deaf.
You can stealth kill your way through 
the entire map without any challenge.

World Design: 
-------------------------------------------------
Lack luster

Story:
--------------------------------------------------
Completely forgetable and irrelevant.

1504,3,0.4809,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","In essence, this is Assassin’s Creed.
And I don’t like Assassins’ Creed.
But if you’re a fan of Assassin’s Creed – give yourself (and this game) a Thumbs Up!

Is Shadow of Mordor an RPG?
Definitely No.
There are no dialogue trees, no character selection, and all side “quests” or more properly – missions, degrade into assassinating an urk, or whatever.

Is it Open World?
Not really.  While the scale of the map is extensive, there is no element of exploring (think Fallout 3 / New Vegas), and all the locations you discover are by no means locales (like villages with interesting NPC’s) but rather places where the aforementioned target for your assassination is awaiting his doom by your hand.

Is there Character Development?  (Potential spoilers)
Eh . . .  There are skill points you spend to “develop” your character, but all the progress concentrates on combat skills and weapons (obviously, since we already established that this is not an RPG, and skill point cannot be sunk into trade skill, or speech, ect).  I see this more in the same venue as weapon upgrading, not character “development.”

Having said all of this, here’s where I see Computer Gaming.
When I want a story – I read a book.  When I seek atmosphere – I listen to music.  When I require a mental challenge – I play board games with friends.  A Computer Game is unique in that it is able to unite all of those things together.  A good computer game can, at least.
Middle Earth – Shadow of Mordor is not that game.
While having decent mechanics and a good story it simply does not have a good gameplay.  You get the gist of what the entire playthrough will be like in the first 15 minutes or so – run, kill, run, kill, upgrade, run, kill more of the same – no rest for you, because you’re dead or something.  Ahm, ok.  I don’t find such a gameplay fun, which unfortunately I have to bear through to uncover the story.

Speaking of which.
The Story is not only the plot but also the telling.  Shadow of Mordor’s pace is sheer madness – there is no pause, no place to take a break, the urks are constantly spawning, the bosses continually appearing if you’re killed, and so on.  So, of course it is different for everybody, but I want my Tolkien story told by a gray-bearded Socrates looking grandpa, who is peacefully puffing on his cavendish cherry-wood pipe, while turning the burning coals in the fire and sipping his chamomile tea, NOT by a speed-junky, who yells out an extremely abridged “Hobbit” in 3 seconds while flying past me on a motorcycle.  That’s Shadow of Mordor’s story-telling.

So in short, i feel like the game is punishing me for wanting to uncover the plot of the story.  I simply can't move through the main plot at my own speed - i need to do that by grinding through irrelevant, monotonous, repeatative assassination missions.  And that is just not my idea of fun.  Sounds more like work and a waste of time - unfortunately, to get through the story i am forced to those tedious things.

[u]To Devs / Publishers:[/u]
When porting, please, start implementing FOV sliders for PC Gamers.  Yes, we PC Gamers get it – Consoles are the future, and console owners are your target group.  But here’s the thing – we, PC Gamers, still pay you money.  Why not make us happy, and throw in a freebie in the form of the NORMAL, expanded FOV.


[u] Instead of this Game, try these for an RPG experience: [/u] 
Fallout 3 (+ New Vegas)
Dragon Age Origins


[u] Games Similar to Shadow of Mordor, but which i think are better: [/u]
Saints Row the Third
Darksiders
Red Faction: Guerrilla
Red Faction: Armageddon
Just Cause 2

And of course i highly recommend reading Tolkien - BOOKS RULE!

1509,0,0.3107,"buy, money, work, run, pc, fix, still, say, try, start","On the whole, the game is great in many aspects. The game play is top notch with the ability to start and handle large scale crowd fights and the hierarchy of the Uruk Captains is fun to mess with and organize the best captains to work for you.

But the game does fail a bit in the Story and this game will lag on cheaper systems.

The biggest reason I give this a negative review is because this game is bugged. But not just a small bug, but a bug that nearly broke my computer. I was able to play the game normally for about 5 minutes before it crashed my computer, and it then started a chain reaction of it crashing my computer even when I'm not running the game and it took until I uninstalled the game for it to stop. In addition to this, it made it so I can not open MalwareBytes, meaning I can check for other viruses. In short, this game completely screwed my computer and needed a full wipe. This could very well be a personal issue with it, but I feel this warning needed to be shared.

Basically, the game itself is a solid 8/10, but this bug has ruined it for me"
1510,3,0.4815,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","The success that 2014's Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor garnered is undeniable; the title went on to win four Game of the Year awards and over 50 others. Despite some of the controversies that arose, it's the most successful Lord of the Rings based game to this day, and it still has its own large fanbase flocking around it. Developed by Monolith Productions and published by WB Games, the biggest selling point that this title had at the time of release was its unique Nemesis system, which garnered a lot of attention due to its ingenuity.

Players are put into the role of Talion, a captain of Gondor who is stationed in a garrison at the Black Gate of Mordor. Soon after the game begins, the garrison is attacked by Sauron's Orc forces who are led by the Hammer, Tower, and Black Hand of Sauron. Talion attempts to repel the attack, but he finds himself, his wife, and his son mercilessly captured. It doesn't take long for the Black Hand to slit the throats of Talion's wife and child right in front of his eyes, and then lay a curse upon Talion himself as his throat is also slit. The curse causes him to be ""banished from death"", and in turn he is destined to wander Middle-Earth for the rest of eternity, on a plane between life and death. However, he soon runs into the spirit of an ancient Elf, who turns out to be the legendary Celebrimbor. The two join forces in an effort overthrow the warchiefs of Mordor, regain Celebrimbor's memories, and avenge the deaths of Talion's family.

The biggest selling point that Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor houses is its unique Nemesis system. At the time of original release, nothing else like it had been created, and nothing like it has come since. Essentially, while gamers duke it out against Orcs in Middle-Earth, they can run in to various Orc warchiefs, captains, and other special foes who each have their place within the roster of Sauron. Defeating one of these enemies weakens Sauron's army, but their place will be taken as time goes on; creating a never-ending cycle of Orcs to slaughter. If players are killed by a special Orc, or run away from one in battle, they will remember the player and call them out, along with their previous actions, on the next encounter. It's a deeply detailed system that deserves praise and recognition for its innovation; it should also be noted that it took me over 20 hours of play time to see any Orc twice.

The remainder of the game, however, is extremely overhyped, lackluster, somewhat frustrating, and at times boring. Whether you're a casual lover of Lord of the Rings, or an Elvish-speaking super-fan, the story is as mediocre and basic as it can get; guy sees his family killed, guy goes to avenge his family, guy has startling revelation, good guy wins, the end. As a character, Talion is underwhelming in all aspects, and his fleshing-out is very shallow. This leaves Celebrimbor to pick up the slack, which he does very well since he's a protagonist that's already deeply involved in the lore from Lord of the Rings. There are also huge chunks of the plot missing, more often than not when a cutscene occurs it feels as though something has been missed or played out of order. Random, second-rate characters appear out of nowhere, or so it would seem; unless one has ventured to gather, and listen to, all of the nearby artifact collectibles.

WB Games and Monolith did a wonderful job of taking the older, unpolished, and somewhat broken fighting mechanics from their Batman titles and implementing it into Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor, along with the parkour running and climing from Assassin's Creed II. Effectively, all of the controls in the game feel like a meshing of these two franchises, which can only leave them to be described as clunky at best, and annoyingly cumbersome at worst. Combos are dropped on the regular despite having pressed the appropriate counter-attack buttons, Talion climbs when he's not supposed to and doesn't climb when he needs to, and the amount of button mashing that's present will surely heighten anyone's thumb stamina. It's obvious that when it comes to mechanics, all of the developer's resources went in to the aforementioned Nemesis system.

Comparatively speaking, the size of Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor's world was on par for 2014, though it's significantly smaller in terms of todays titles; especially after the release of The Witcher 3. The game is split up into two maps, each of which have their own missions and collectibles. When it comes down to missions, there are a total of 20 for the main story, 24 for rescuing slaves, and 10 each for upgrading Talion's bow, dagger, and sword. The ones that offer the most diversity, of course, are the missions that revolve around the main story. Other than that, rescuing slaves and upgrading the weapons become exhaustingly repetitive; sneak in here, cut that guy down, repeat 3-7x, or use your bow/sword/dagger to kill X number of Orcs in X way in X amount of time without being seen/triggering an alarm.

Even traversing the maps becomes burdensome over time, and completely aggravating on occasion due to the constant and massive amount of Orcs that are present in nearly every corner. I remember at one point I was fending off some 20-30 Orcs just as I was trying to get from Point A to Point B to pick up an artifact item, and among the horde were 7... yes, SEVEN, special Orcs; needless to say I got slaughtered. Battles can rage from 30-60 minutes easily, especially if one Orc slips away to call for backup, without there being any reason for them to; just due to the sheer density of AI opponents. Forget about taking down warchiefs and the gazillions of enemies that rear their ugly, green heads at that point. The fact that the combat mechanics aren't even good makes this aspect a hundred times more infurating than it needed to be.

Overall, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor provides a very underwhelming, repetitious, and shallow gaming experience. The title was purposfully overhyped by YouTube content creators who were given free copies of the game on a promise that they would talk positively about it; not to mention the mainstream media over-sensationalization of it. Therefore, there are people that will defend this game to their dying breath. Sure, it's not the worst game ever created, but it's far from the best, and the main selling point (the Nemesis system) is buried within awful combat mechanics and terrible parkour controls. There are a decent amount of upgrades, abilities, and weapon runes to unlock and find, but even this semi-RPG aspect does not help the title to deviate away from its hollow feel. Players that enjoy open world games with an endless supply of battles will probably enjoy themselves the most here, while all others are recommended to look elsewhere for entertainment.

Pros

- Stunning Visuals
- Nemesis System

Cons

Everything else

- Combat is nothing but button mashing nonsense.

- Various tiers of enemies may require specific moves to be performed to defeat them........ but due to enemy swarms, 
   poor targeting in large enemy groups, no lock-on targeting, and uninterruptable moves it may be impossible to hit the intended target.

- Movement involves slow sneaking (even when holding run), slow walking, or full on non-stop sprinting and nothing else. 
   In all scenarios your character is either to fast to cover large distances without being noticed or too slow to pass timed 
   events or catch fleeing enemies (especially those with ranged immunities).

- Countless unskippable, and continuously repeated, cutscenes.

- The camera is too close to the player and obstructs the view of the area near them while you're field of view is also 
   hampered by the environment (trees, landscape, structures, etc). And don't think you can simply increase the camera 
   sensitivity so you can survey your surroundings more quickly........ because that ignores environmental obstructions and 
   makes the bow impossible to use.

- Traversing obstacles by climbing is EXTREMELY clunky and doesn't work well with fast movements. There is also no way 
   to tell the difference between things you can and can't climb.

- Player leveling is completely meaningless. Granted, it allows you to aquire skills necessary to progress through the 
  game........ but that's it. None of the abilities, skills, runes (or the number you equip) ever make you feel that you're any 
  more powerful than when you started.

- The story is extremely short and incredibly boring. The entire game is 10% main story, 10% skill/ability unlocking 
   quests, and 80% filler. If you were to skip all of the irrelevant content the main story is only 5-10hrs long.

- etc etc etc......"

1518,3,0.5114,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","A game that takes place in the lord of the rings universe but contains some new features and some generic combat. Lets review of shadow of mordor in a pro/ con style and end with my conclusion.

Pro:
      Graphics are good. The world of mordor looks pretty ok on the first location but in the second location there is a lush pasture which is quite nice to look ate in a game dealing with the destruction of the realm of man or any non orc beings.

       The characters sub characters are pretty decent. They are well modeled and well voiced leading to some nice conversations or in the case of ratbags...humor. Yes ratbag is a funny orc and that is pretty nice touch in the game.

        The game is long. We are not talking about skyrim levels of long but there are quite a lot of things to do besides the main quests. Theres side missions that deal with mastery of the main characters weapons, conquesting the main lord of the rings villian's army, collectables, hunter quest, scavenger quest, and dlc. Though currently buying mordor grants the player the goty edition as the only version to buy but it still adds alot of value.

        The game orc soldiers have stats or useful information. The main enemies in the game are no push overs, they require skill and planning to take down. The information for the enemies are gained from other orcs, captured people, or information laid out in the game. It displays the strengths and weakness of the captains which are a large variety. Doing the weaknesses really help out the fight.

          The army arrangement is unique. The game has an army for the main bad guy, really dont know his name... Anyways the placement of each of the soldiers change depending on a variety of things like dying to a captain raises that captain up the ranks. That is pretty cool and shuffles the remaining captains around. If a captain is killed another will take its place in due time so there are plenty of opportunities to experience a variety of soldiers. If a regular guy kills the player then they can join the ranks if there is a spot open.

          Most of the story is nice. Well to be fair the story that deals with the ghost guy's back story is pretty cool and very interesting to experience but the main character's revenge plot is nothing to write home about. Pretty generic and overall not interesting which is majority of the game. I put it as a pro because those small ammount of backstory missions really are what is the most enjoyable story moments of the game.

Con:
      The main character is unlikeable. Other than his character design; his personality is not enjoyable. How can a person be immersed as a character with little to no personality than his sole purpose in this world is to have revenge. Now a plot with revenge can be good like in the case of john wick the movie but here with the lacking of any interesting personality, the character is too dull to enjoy.

       Game breaking bug. Now this is a weird moment but when I started the game, there were no missions available from the start. Even after getting intel from an enemy the game would never place the missions on the map or in the game. It is a real bug and the only way is to restart all progress over again. This was an annoying issue because I was 20.3% done with the game but locked only in the first area and have no opportunities to progress.

       Terrorized enemeis suck. When an enemies is terrorized or retreating they end up running away. That is very obvious but they run just as fast as the main character and if you chase them be prepared for a very long run. It is even worse when an ability that can help the issue can not be used if the enemy is immune to range damage. Then you can not stick an arrow on to an orc's leg and catch up and finish them off the way that you choose to. This just prolongs the sequence because if they get away then all your progress to attempt to kill them was for nothing. GG really fun to chase after a guy that runs just as fast as me.

       Some of the orc's special abilities really suck. There are annoying abilities like rapid health regen or spawning in more enemies. Those 2 are the very annoying ones. The health regen sucks because on some enemies it regens very fast that making progress on killing them is a tedius chore and the spawning more enemies just prolong the fight more. It is not fun to have to deal with massive ammount's of enemies and a boss at the same time.

       QTE second winds are not enjoyable. For starters most of the combat is QTE but now when the character's life hits 0 the player is thrown into a QTE where they must move their cursor into a circle and hit the button prompt. That is ok up until you realize that after it is done the first time the circle gets smaller and fills up faster. To add on to that the cursor moves slower making it near impossible to pull off a second second wind. Heres an idea, if the second wind is done just straight up and kill us on then next down than give us hope that we can pull off another revive. Crazy idea huh?

Conclusion;
      Shadow of mordor is a decent game. Certainly nothing too big which makes me wonder what is all the hype about? Is it because it is another game with batman style combat or its a game dealing with the lord of the rings universe? Needlessto say the game is underwhelming. There are some good things about the game but some unique mechanics tend to make the game less enjoyable to me and that the main character has pretty much no enjoyable qualities and not interesting to play as. There is potential that the game could of been good but from the experience so far it is a game that take 1 step forward and 2 steps backward. I can not recommend the game."

I understand the appeal for the game, but I have a few issues with it. 

First off let me say that the game has  some of the best combat I've ever seen, It's like the batman series but with swords and more fury. I loved it. It also has very good voice acting, some of the best I've seen in any game. The production quality really is good. 

Now my problems with the game: 

The entire game is one big grind, most of the missions are the very similar to each other, and while the game tries to give you several mechanics to bring variety to missions, I still feel like they're all the same. The stealth is only mediocre at best, setting up for a fight properly is very time consuming and often unrewarding, making you hack and slash your way through the entire game basically.

The story is more bland than boiled egg whites, and takes just as long to finish. It took me less than 15 hours to finish the main story plus maybe a third of the side missions and a lot of screwing around riding caragors. It's very difficult to relate to the characters and most of them are as interesting as eggshell wallpaper. This is LORT we're talking about,  where is the lore ? Where are the items and easter eggs ? 3 minutes of cutscenes shouldn't do it.

The game only has a handful of characters, and considering that anyone else you meet is an uruk or a mute slave, the game can get pretty boring and gives you a sense of loneliness. 

Now I know this is mordor we are talking about, but the world is [b]really[/b] empty and boring, there really is nothing to do except hack and slash your way through Uruks, and no matter how good the game makes that, it will get boring FAST. 

This game had so much potential and I was really disappointed when I played it. I hope the next game in the series is improved. It needs more interesting side missions and a longer story."
1524,3,0.5581,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","So I sort of started writing a reply on the forums asking about the story and I started writing a review. And I figured it may actually be okay for a review so I'm writing it here:

As far as lore goes it gets the names right... and well I never came across a detailed story of how Celibrimbor was tortured to give up the formula for the rings of power so they did have some creative liberties. But there is the thing. Sauron tortured him to give up the FORMULA. In the story they say Spoiler: [spoiler] That it was Celibrimbor himself who forged the one ring.
Bullshit.
I makes no sense for Sauron to not have created the ring himself. If it was not HIS creation why would it still follow his will over the actual creator? Why would it be bound to HIS life over Celibrimbor? 

Also there is a cutscene showcasing Sauron having mind control over Celibrimbor - an elf without the one ring. It is my understanding that while Saurons mind powers were great he couldn't order elves around. Only orcs. This is why he needed to disguise himself when the rings of power were made. If he could mind control Celibrimbor from the get go why wouldn't he just have him made all the rings of power without all the need for useless espionage? This is why he needed the ring so the scene when he controls his mind before the one ring is constructed makes absolutely no sense. [/spoiler]

As for the rest of the story. The Main character is your cookie cutout male hero without a personality. They propably wanted to copy and paste Aragorn and failed badly at it. The orcs have better personalities, which is why I played this game for as long as I had. The Nemesis system is the only good thing about this game.

Celebrimbor is better than Failed Aragorn. But I'm not sure if the devs got him right or not. He was tortured by Sauron so he may have turned out as he did if he ended up a wraith. But then again. Elves usually wouldn't encourige some ranger who was killed to raise an orc army to fight fire with fire. Then again you are fighting off evil so maybe... I'm just an intermediate in Tolkien lore. I think you'd need an expert to judge how Celibrimbor turned out.

There is also a Gollum cameo... thats it... not much to say. He didn't do anything except be gollum. Though tbh the appearance of Gollum did remind me that it is indeed middle earth not Theadas or Warhammer or whatever world is D&D set in. Seriously. This game has nowhere the feel of the Tolkien's world. Was this supposed to be Mordor? Why am I seeing pretty flowers, grasslands and rivers? What next? Bunnies skipping over mount doom? And aren't these orcs supposed to be an army? All I see are spare patrols and occasional warbands. And the forts are bearly protected with a random archer on watch. Heck they don't even do anything horrible to the slaves. ""I know I'm a creature of Darkness and I could rip apart this human and feed on his guts. But I need to keep this PG12""

Speaking of Tolkien feel. In the movies and books, you had Epic battles. Heros against villains. Good against Evil. Armies of Darkness covered the whole fields with their corruption. Yada Yada. They were big what I mean to say. So when they told me that I'm going to raise an orc army to fight against another orc army. I was indeed excited. But when we finally get to the final battle its 5 of your guys against a small group of enemies + your nemesis. Granted I liked my nemesis. He was propably the best character. A randomly generated grunt archer that sniped me in a random fort. Yes. The best character for me is a nameless NPC given a randomly generated name and title. But Characters aside since I already ranted about those for a bit. The Battle was underwhelming and way too small to even be called a battle. But then again same can be said for the ending. As the game might as well have been over when my nemesis' head left his shoulders as what came after was so boring, rushed and generic I already forgot about it. All I can say is: The final boss is a quick time event. 

So no I won't recommend it. It had a good system and it is my hope that some other developer will take this system and imprements it into a game with a good story and a good ending."

I've always been a HUUUUUUGE fan of Tolkien, read the LoTR books at least 5 times, and The Silmarillion once a year (so, maybe ten times). But it seams that a curse falls on Middle Earth's videogames, as I don't recall a single one that is memorable (LoTR Online, was ok, I guess, but it was not the best MMORPG).
The EA LoTR movies games, are abhorrent and confusing. LoTR Conquest, had everything to be one of the greatest games ever, but they botched it. War in the North, well... I won't even bother to uter a word about it.
Shadow of Mordor falls under the same curse. It is a dull game. Absolutely boring. The most repetitive thing I ever done in my life, and I catch the same train every morning!
Dont get me wrong! It starts very nice and well, and you'll enjoy the first couple of hours. But then, once you realise that THAT is all the game is, you get bored really quick. It's always the same thing: parkour, kill some orks. More parkour, more ork killing; Parkour your way into an ork-camp, and kills all those wretchs, always the same way.
The DLC's are nicer, since they something different to the game, but I dont think that a nice DLC is enough to save a bad base game.

You wil die. A lot. Not because of the the actions of the Orc Captains. Not because of the Graug. Not because of a lack of varioous upgrades or learned proficiences.

By far the biggest killer (about 80%+) are the really horrible controls, or lack thereof. You will die looking at the sky, as your perspective view changes, at random, for no apparent reason. This happens very, very frequently. Your plan, having spent 10 or 15 minutes thinning the herd and getting your character into position, will be sabotaged when you suddendly find yourself up looking up his nostrals, not at the enemy you were sneaking up on and who is now raising the alarm as some mouth breather is standing still, staring upwards and not responding to being shot, slashed, clubbed, bitten, fondled, kissed or taken out for dinner (who knows, I can only see the sky?).

Well first off, the faithfullness to the Middle Earth Universe is astounding - like how there are 0 orcs in Mordor, only Uruk-hai (that technically shouldn't exist yet since this game takes place before Saruman starts breeding them), or how all of the Uruks have British accents, or the inclusion of Gollum even though he has no business being in Mordor at this point in the timeline - but my favorite has to be the decision to disregard the unique and individual map style Tolkien created for his books and instead use a generic boring shades-of-blue modern GPS style for the game map!  So creative!

The gameplay is just perfection too!  The variety of mission type is astounding!  There's one where you follow someone then kill uruks in three areas, another where you follow someone then kill uruks in three areas, wow there was even one where you follow someone then kill uruks in three areas.  Then they blindside you with a mission that has you follow someone and [b]COLLECT HERBS IN THREE AREAS[/b]!  My goodness, I could play this game forever and never get absolutely bored out of my fucking mind!

Combat is great, especially if you've played the [i]Batman: Arkham[/i] games, because then you don't even have to learn anything new!  The combat is literally exactly perfectly no seriously EXACTLY identical to the combat in the Arkham games, even the combos and upgrade trees are the same!  Don't worry though, it totally never felt tedious or like I had played this game already, and I certainly never thought about how you could probably make a Middle Earth texture mod for Arkham Knight and get a better game than this, hahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

The story is great, such memorable characters.  There was uhhhhh the...ummm, the guy with the wife?  He was cool, kinda disappeared after a while, but the two cutscenes he was in were great.  Then there was uhhhhhhhhhhhh.............uhhhhhhhh........THE DWARF!  Yeah, the dwarf uh what was his name?  Doesn't matter, so memorable, especially when you go hunting with him!  Well, that's all you ever do with him, but yeah.  OH!  And that one woman, who ummmm.  Well her mom is possessed I guess, so she cares about her mom.  Guys she cares about her mom, what other game has this much depth to its characters??

And of course, gotta give a mention to the GENIUS Nemesis system.  I really love how every time an Uruk captain shows up, the game takes away control of the camera to focus on them so they can say a lazy one-liner and ruin your hit streak, definitely didn't get aggravating after the 30th time, no sir.  I also loved how every time one of them dies, or gets branded, or runs away, the game pauses to show you a cutscene of them dying or getting branded or running away, then jumps to the Nemesis menu to show them dying or getting branded or running away.

See guys, I'm an imbecile (that means stupid haha), so sometimes when I kill someone in a video game, I'm not actually sure that I killed him after the cutscene of their flying decapitated head ends - so it's a total godsend that this game wastes my time repeatedly telling me what I literally just saw happen, over and over ad nauseam.  I loved it, and I bet total idiots like me will love it too!

What a piece of shit game, I'm sincerely ashamed of myself that I played 30 hours of this garbage waiting for it to get good.  The story is shit.  The gameplay is shit.  The missions are a fucking chore.  The world is literally painful to look at.  I'm not even going to bother with the DLCs, and I have no intention of ever installing this again."

In 2013 I can see how this has won a game of the year, but after games like Assasin's Creed or Batman Arkham City has come out, this kind of pales in comparison.

The appeal of this game is the combat system and the nemesis system. I would prefer Assassin's Creed or the Arkham City game because those games have combat systems that are just as good, but actually have a good storyline too.

Final verdict: Buy the Assasin's Creed or a Batman Arkham game instead"
1533,4,0.6504,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Not really enjoyable.

Aside from the grindy, often stupid Arkham-meets-Witcher combat that doesn't do what you want it to do when you need to do it, the game manages tutorials very poorly, sending you across the entire game map just to start the story moving, but to get there you have to pass through every high-level, orc-filled area in the game.

The Nemesis system is supposed to be the selling point of the shallow, boring gameplay, but I found it to be entirely stupid and annoying. For example: a minor orc lieutenant I killed early came back to harass me as I tried to make this ""across the entire map to get the story moving"" trek early in the game, which was fine, I suppose, other than the fact that they only seem to appear to annoy you in the middle of a fight you're already pretty deep into with a lot of orcs. Then, after I killed him again, I moved on and cleared an area, to reach a point I needed to get to. As I was trying to pass through, I was attacked by dozens of orcs with three different lietenants, running and fighting them all at once, and running in circles. As I'm killing off all these lieutenants and surviving, this same orc shows up again, probably 10 minutes after the last time I killed him. I then defeat him and continue this never-ending fight with multiple leaders and tons of tertiary orcs. Before I can kill the final lieutenant in this long, continuous fight that's been going on for 5 to 10 minutes, he shows up yet again. I'm attacked by the same orc for the third time in less than 20 minutes and twice within the same fight, at which point, I'm finally killed and this walking game bug is made more powerful.

No, I don't want to play anymore of this dumb garbage."
1534,4,0.5923,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","To be fair, I haven't played much but I'm probably not going to try it again. You get thrown into a dark landscape and start to move against your objective. You encounter orcs and the camera is in batman mode, shaky and zoomed. The reason for this is so that 1 million orcs can spawn around you. You are completely OP against 1 orc, even a leader. But before you have killed the leader, 3 others have appeared along with 10 orcs each. Eventually you die by the numbers.

I like witcher 3 alot and this is nothing like that.

Update: Since I was having a cold I decided to try some more. 

It's a really repetitive assassins creed ripoff. You get no hints of what to do except this is the main mission but do other missions. You have no idea which one is super easy or which one is impossible. There are also easier side missions which takes place where you pick them up but its like another instance of the same place. I just did one and its like a minigame, I was supposed to kill 10 orcs with my bow, a challenge with the steam controller. While I am in this minigame a local thug lord appears and calls for his small cocksucker orcs to kill me . after 30 seconds this happends again, and then again. At this point I have archers everywhere that I am supposed to kill, 3 orc bosses and all their minions. This game is just too random to be fun. Also you can instakill the bosses if you are lucky but normally you get endless pulls of enemies that just pop out of nowhere even though you went full ethnic cleansing in the local area. 

Sometimes when an orc boss gets low enough he decides to run away, two or three times i chased them to the border of the map and they just despawn. They run slightly faster so you cant really catch them.

It has too much Ubisoft formula without even being an Ubisoft game, the nemesis system is interesting at first but not very thought out in this entry and large parts of mid-game story progression are simply grindy without being noticeably fun. Between all the collectibles, way too many uninspired NPCs mixed with very few noteworthy NPCs basically leaves Shadow of Mordor with solely nice optics and a good working combat mechanic. Pretty much everything else, and everything else being lots and lots of content is mediocre at best.

Shadow of Mordor does some things right but it is absolutely incapable of gripping the player in any way whatsoever. Just a mere week after playing the campaign I have forgotten 90% of all NPC interaction as well as story progression, as it is entirely irrelevant to the game except for a very few major plotpoints or unique character appearances which are also way too few in number.

Shadow of Mordor is by no means a bad game, but at what it tries to do, it fails miserably. I have played far worse games, but with many of those I ultimately ended up having way more fun than with Shadow of Mordor. This is also most likely the reason why it sold so miserably on release, even although critical reception wasn't too bad.

Shadow of Mordor lacks one elemantal thing: Soul. Even with such a mighty license behind it, it simply feels emotionally empty and the exact opposite of epic. Therefore, and with mixed feelings, I am unable to recommend it. I'm 100% sure Shadow of War - its sequel - will be more than able to make up for all the things that went wrong with Shadow of Mordor though, but I see no reason why anyone should play Shadow of Mordor over literally any of the Assassin's Creed games.

And to clarify: I don't hate the game by any means, i just can't approve it with all its flaws.

Starting of with what the game does right:

- The often praised orc ranking system has some great ideas and potential, which has not really been used in the end though
- Free flow combat system works as intended and is still very fun to use and rewards skillful use of its possible moveset
- World is designed to be able to go almost anywhere
- Parcour stuff works fine for the most part, but can also lead to some unwanted deaths if not working as desired
- Stealth missions feel well done, fair but still challenging, and are even more fun due to the free movement
- Lots of additional content from the GoTY edition offering more hours of gameplay
- Overall good amount of possible hours to play the game considering the price
- Middle-earth lore (for those who enjoy it)

And everything that makes it a bad game:

- Boring story with unlikeable characters and bad dialoque
- Even more annoying dwarf with even more annoying dialoque
- Unskipable orc intros, turning every fight into an orc speeddating sim
- Way too overpowered skills, game offering [b]almost[/b] no challenge, even when you blindly rush into every mob
- Side missions rather feel like a challenge mode rather than actual side missions
- Orc ranking system absolutely useless in the end
- Both areas boring, uninspired and empty
- Second half of the game recruiting your orc 'army' only leads to a 5 vs 5 fight with a few mobs
- Insultingly bad final boss fight only consisting of 5 QTEs
- Middle-earth lore (for those who dislike it) 

What should make the game great and stand out (the ranking system) ends up being just a method to farm better runes, which is useless as the game is easy, long and repetitve enough even without farming, and to make fights against tougher enemies easier, which is also useless as you can easily pick up on them without any more help with your overpowered skillset. 
Ends up being just a basic RPG with nothing that makes it worth being a AAA title or getting all the hype it got back when it was released.

Bought the game for 3,50€, so i don't feel cheated in any way. If you are really into that Middle-earth stuff, you can buy the game, if not you should only buy it, if it's on sale and if you got lots of free time and no other games to play.

I had the game before and didnt get too into it so i thought i'd get it during the sale.

Dont get me wrong, the main missions in the two maps are pretty fun but the fight against saurons mouth and sauron was weaksauce. 
*SPOILER ALERT* You'd think the final boss would be hard since you built an army to fight the guy but all it took was a buttonmash to defeat him, it was just an insult to see that and then to see warner bro's ending to ramp up for shadow of war. 
The dlc are obviously just missions that they left out of the main game to get a few extra bucks and dont even get me started on the side quests! Warner Bro's pulled the same shit on this game that they did on Mad Max, have atleast 10 story missions and then have sidequests up the ass like Preston Garvey invaded the damn game!

Moral of the story is dont spend money on this game unless you truly love repetative side quests and an overall easy game.

To be fair, since I did manage to finish it, some good parts: 
Stealth mechanics are rather well made, but the only instances that requires stealth are the missions that have mandatory ""be stealthy in this way or fail"" objective. 
The combat is fluid with plenty of moves, but there is this same problem stealth has - there's not that many oportunities to use all the arsenal, since most of the situations can be resolved with rather straight forward approach. Also, after few ablity unlocks, the combat becomes, very, VERY easy. 
I would also like to stress, that both story and lore - one of the strongest points and well done, even if not most engaging. 

Regardless, why would I NOT RECOMMEND?
Well, there are these many different elements with great production value put together in almost the worst way, and then made repetetive.

Kind of random, but what I hated the most - unskipable cutscenes when ""boss"" orcs get intoduced. Especially in the areas with high density, where 4 of them are introduced in a row, leaving the player staring there, at the screen, right in the heat of battle, with something equivalent to commercial brake. It was cool the first time, but when the sequence is triggered every single fucking time a semi-trash uruk or orc appears, holly shit, it's so annoying.

I have done several storyline quests and whenever I engage any of the mini bosses they keep appearing from nowhere till theres like 5-6 of them ganking on me.

ive mostly exited each play due to times when the game has removed access to my bow because itll only allow me to use the sword at that certain time,come on ffs,theyre my weapons and i want to use what and where i like.

its very pretty and at first the sounds of the npcs etc are great,they tend to grate after a while though and become repetetive,they also often dont relate to nearby npcs which is strange and quite annoying,certainly messes up any tactical awareness.

hmm,hard to say much positive actually so im going neg after all ,i dont think ill be playing it much more,theres far better games out there that id rather spend my time on.

Such systems can be discussed of course, but I don't see any merit at all to this game's system.
The endless flow of enemies also made me seem like I wouldn't see the end of it and eventually grew weary of it, again due to the repetitive nature of the game.

For those who don't know, they decided to shut down the MMO videogame Asheron's Call after 17 years of service. Afterwards, they compelled the shutdown of the community's attempt to continue playing this game via alternative/private means, presumably in order to protect their IP rights. So now this historically significant videogame has apparently been permanently shuttered, with its remaining loyal playerbase turned away, even though WB has indicated no desire to leverage this property for any future business venture.

I of course understand the nature of business and their duty to their shareholders, however I think special care is required with these kinds of products. We can just as easily make an argument for the reputational risk WB has been exposed to as a result of this decision. Google ""74-Year-Old Grandpa Says Goodbye To MMO He's Played Since 1999"" and I'm sure you'll agree (sorry, I can't post a link).

Ultimately, their actions display a lack of respect and appreciation for their paying customers. It also calls into question our ability to trust WB when it comes to their handling of other online properties. Is it safe to become attached to a game owned by WB? Will they continue to mismanage other virtual worlds? Can we ever really believe that they will be invested in their communities for the long haul? I for one will now be extremely skeptical of purchasing or spending significant time playing future WB games.

WB, I hope you will have the decency to revisit your decisions regarding Asheron's Call. Please consider the emotional connection your customers have to this game world. Have some respect. This is a decision that cannot be simply analyzed by dollars and cents..."

It's not terrible. But would I recommend it? No.
Some spoilers ahead.

The gameplay is not that bad, although fighting is a bit like Guitar Hero, pressing the right buttons at the right time. The storyline is disappointing and finishing the game feels empty. There is no reward. All bosses (except The Hammer and a Graug) are a joke, and the Nemesis system didn't work for me.

All these captains have no story and as a result it isn't interesting. The only time I actually felt like one of those guys was some sort of rival was when he had killed me twice. It felt satisfying to take that one out. But then the game spits you in the face by just respawning him a minute later - and that actually happened twice in a row.

The worst about this game, however, is how repetitive it is. You keep doing the same things over and over again. I just tried to finish the Bright Lord campaign, but I simply couldn't do it. I branded all 5 warchiefs (my face had already contorted in pain when I saw that objective pop up, since that is the exact same thing you had to do in the main campaign) and faced off against Sauron, who simply snaps his fingers to turn them all against you and you can start all over again (but then you face them all at the same time as well as normal Uruks all around you). And if you managed to win that (I had to ragequit before that though), Sauron starts to revive them one by one. It's terrible.
Fighting in stongholds is terrible anyway, since you will find yourself surrounded by 30 Uruks in no time. Killing or branding captains or warchiefs (a mission that is probably the most common in this game) is a total pain this way. It isn't fun, it is frustrating. You want to get it over with so you can continue the story. I have yet to try some game modes, but I'm not expecting too much.

The best about this game? Gollum.

The good:
- Nice graphics
- Good voice acting
- Gollum!

The bad:
- Way too repetitive
- Often frustrating
- Boss battles are a joke
- Disappointing storyline
- Nemesis system is usually boring and meaningless"

I started playing ''Shadow of Mordor'' with no expectations whatsoever and those already nonexistent ''expectations'' were destroyed by the game. At first you get introduced to the tutorial (like in any other game) which doesn't last long at all. One second you're doing a very short tutorial and the next second you're seeing random flashbacks, at first it all seems deacent enough but that's just a mirage of what's to come. So called ''stealth'' tutorial is there aswell and it lasts about 20ish seconds. Few seconds later you're teleported to Mordor with no actual knowlage of the combat or overall gameplay. Combat is - well its deacent if you're fond of combat that consists of: Clicking left mouse button, F key and sometimes a spacebar. Finishers are there aswell, honestly finishers are the only good thing about the game including graphics. Shadow of Mordor is full of quick time events (if you can call them that), eaven those ''quick time events'' are bland and their sole purpose is to try to make the game a bit more challenging. Graphics are quite good if you dont take in the consideration layout and overall landscape of the maps, which is a shame to the graphics team (good on you graphics team!). Landscape is copy/paste in its ''finest'' form. Over time every noock and cranny looks the same and pale like the combat and (sadly) the story. Ahhhhh now we are at the part where it makes me die a little bit inside when thinking about it, and that is the story of ''Shadow of Mordor''. Game is set in Mordor (title - duh), story is like the tutorial (bland, quick and badly writen). I don't want to spoil anything for any people that are intrested in the game but to say the least its a pure crime what they did. I personally think that the story is not tought out well and that it could of been much better, its very pale and boring. Protagonist (main character) is boring as good old pet rock, his story is like any other ''tragic'' hero (oh no my wife and child were killed..... I suppose im off to killing millions of orks/uruks and quite alot of warchiefs). Game wont hold your ''hand'' and lead you trough the story, you on your own must listen to the loading screen dialogues to figure out the story, do tons of boring and repetative sidequests and all that ''good'' stuff. I nearly forgot that there is a thing called ''nemesis system'', its good I guess if you like doing endless rounds of warchief bloodshed (sounds better than it is). You can upgrade you'r sword/ dagger(broken sword) and a bow with runes which give a deacent boost to statistics of the weapon you chose to upgrade, its nice overall (like any other weapon upgrades in any other game you played-really).

I would like to apologize once agein for any (basically all) negative comments about the game, I was really saddened once I came to realisation of what I expirienced in the game. I really want to like it but its the way it is, maybe sometime down the line I'll give it another go.

1621,4,0.6171,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Complete unmitigated shit.

Game mechanics are completely incoherent. The entire combat is designed very well, to fight up about 3-4 enemies at once. When do you find yourself fighting 3-4 enemies at once? Almost never. You're almost always just warmed with 50+ orcs at the same time like it's Dynasty f*cking Warriors. So almost the entire game you are fighting 50+ enemies with a combat skillset specifically designed for 3-4 enemies at a time. What?

The second biggest problem is that during your quest to do something else, including resolving a power struggle, other random orc captains can f*cking randomly just be around the general area or be on the way to the next quest objective, which means now you have to do the actual objective AND fight the new officer.

What is worse, the difficulty of the new captain is completely random. This can derail your side mission and waste a lot of time. What makes this problem even worse is that it takes a whole lot of time to actually pick up powerups dropped from dead defeated captains, during which you are NOT invulnerable.

I have had fights going on for 45+ minutes that started as a simple power struggle, then some orc captain shows up and I have to fight them. Then in the middle of fighitng THAT orc captain ANOTHER one shows up, and so on and so on. It went on for a LONG LONG time before I could FINALLY actually go and pick up the 20 or so powerups from my huge line of defeated captains, or I die from something and then miss the powerups. Needless to say, this is completely dumb.

I think with this game such a randomised experience can mean some players get a set of warlocks that arent too hard to deal with, and some people just get impossible ones until they're level 999999999 with max unlocks everything, the shallow design not helping the cause here. I got some pretty super easy randomized orcs, and I've gotten some bloody impossible ones. For some people it was too easy and I can definitely see that. For me it was mostly too easy, until you get unlucky and get some impossible combination warchief with bodyguard who are also impossible combinations that killed it for me. I feel like the randomisation here is so depended upon yet so underdeveloped. Whoever coded this hasn't actually put in the playtesting effort to actually make it work consistently. It is hit or miss and when it misses it REALLY misses.

I would suggest:
- When I'm on a quest (side / main), like I pressed an ACTUAL BLOODY QUEST START BUTTON TO START A BLOODY QUEST, remove ALL possibility of random orc captain / officer encounters. Despawn them. I want to be focused on the quest experience without being derailed by having to fight 8 other random bloody captains that just stumbled in.
- Make upgrade pickup animation invulnerable, and stun all surrounding orcs when it happens.
- Implement a director AI logic in order to pace out random captain walk-in engagements when the player is focused trying to do something else. Maybe 1 or 2 occasional is good, but when you get a long bloody chain of 20 officers that drag every fight out to 45+ minutes the game is broken.
- Spawn less but more powerful normal guard enemies, or buff AOE attacks. either focus on the 4-5 enemies experience or go Dynasty Warriors route and give me a moveset that can actually deal with 50+ enemies. A moveset designed for 4-5 enemies then throw 50+ guards at me is like giving someone tweezers and telling them to use that to build a tank. Wrong tool for the job.
- If you are going to rely your entire main story missions on randomly generated enemies, make sure the random generation is consistent and actually playtest this random generation. Don't have a boss immune to everything with bodyguards immune to everything except 1 achiles heel. Have at least 2 weaknesses, and rather than hard immunity I think soft immunity works better where instead of just saying no you can't do it, just make it less effective.

For anyone that actually thinks the fighting mechanics this game is remotely good, I have a few suggestions to improve your life:

Step 1: Install Devil May Cry 3
Step 2: Play that for 80 hours straight
Step 3: Go back to Shadow of Mordor
Step 4: Now try to tell me with a straight face that Shadow of Mordor has good fighting LOL don't crack me up.

This game basically forces you to grind until it's actually possible to play the game. You beat the completely incoherent game design by just cramping stats. The game has epic upgrades that you just play for 900000000000000000000000000000000000000 years and grind out until you can take out 50 enemies by sheer force of will and quality of equipment.

This game is NOT skill based at all. Maybe in an industry where gamers love things that are pseudo random grind (Destiny, Shadow of Mordor ...etc) I just don't fit to be a gamer any more. Or maybe I should just go play Devil May Cry 3 for 80 more hours straight.

Artificial difficulty best describes this game, the combat system isn´t interesting so instead of making enemies that are varied and a fun challenge to fight they just make the orc captains immune to some things and weaker to others. The info you need on their strengths and weaknesses is very easy ( and repedetive ) to come by. They also have strongholds where you need to kill some captains and warchiefs wich pretty much just means that if you get seen, you´ll get swamped by an armada of orcs and you just have to run. You could fight 20+ of them at the same time but it takes forever since you can´t ground execute the stunned orcs ( getting hit cancels the animation ). The open world isn´t particularly interesting to explore, you can collect artifacts and some kind of symbols on walls ( don´t even know what they are ) but again it´s just walking up to it and pressing R1. There are some things in the game that make no sense at all lore wise, it feels off to me but anyone not interested in lore will not care. All by all just not good, no idea where it got it´s good reviews because to me it´s just stale and repedetive.

The graphic is nice, control is fluid, game is pretty optimized for PC. 



[b]The bad:[/b]

This game is extremely repetitive and gets old quickly. There's so many poorly designed game mechanics.

1. Every boss battle comes down to ""quick time event button mashing"", this is stupid on so many levels. Most game developers stopped using ""QTE"" a decade ago.

2. Every stronghold you visit, the game throws endless number of enemies at you, It gets quite frustrating and is a cheap way to extend the total play time. You are forced to run away and come back and do the exact same thing all over again.

3. The game gave you powerful abilities and a rich open world to explore. However, all mission and side quest somehow forces you to play in a certain way. It's either forced stealth or forced killing styles or count down timer.

4. Skills and abilities require way too much time and effort to obtain, this is a single player game. No one should waste time with endless grinding in a offline single player game. The progression pacing is completely unbalanced.

5. Main story related missions are poorly designed. They are all follow > escort/rescue > forced stealth. You really don't have any freedom on how to approach a misison.

6. Even the developers know their game is extremely repetitive because one of the paid DLC unlock a ""infinite combat finisher move"" so you can quickly dispatch a group of enemies to save some time. You have to pay the developer on top of the full game just to save yourself some time and frustration. Holy crap....

To sum this game up, it's basically ""Wide as an ocean and deep as a puddle"". You're basically doing the exact same thing over and over again just at different locations.

Gameplay consists of freeflow combat and 'stealth' sections, like AC. Combat is fine, it's not as polished as AC but it's ok. My problem is they literally copy+paste'd the entire combat system. You even press the same button combinations to execute same special attacks. Also the 'stealth' in this game is a joke. I'm not someone who complains about a game being easy but I will about this game. You can literally sneak+run towards enemies while they are facing you and stealth kill them. I will admit it is very empowering and the kill animations are very nice but it gets very boring very fast. Also the camera in this game is a little weird. I don't understand why they chose to put it at same level as your character, instead of a little higher. This is specially annoying when you are running. Speaking of running, this game has a 'parkour' system similar to Assassin's Creed. Would you be surprised if I told you it's nowhere near as polished? Most baffling part is that you can't climb obstacles if you approach them from certain angles, you just stop and lose all your momentum as well as your motivation to play the game. 

This game also has one of the most bland game worlds I've seen in a while. Everywhere looks the same. It is an insult to the world Tolkien created. The story is another insult. It barely exists and it is so poorly handled, they might as well not bothered. Our main character Talion is as bland and forgettable as they get. Elf-guy was much more interesting because of his background but there is no characterisation whatsoever, so I didn't care for him either. This game completely fails in being a good open world game too. Side missions are very repetitive and boring, and there are a lot of them. Collectibles are ok though because they give you a little bit of lore.

Now let's talk about the nemesis system. It's ok. It's not the groundbreaking thing everyone makes it out to be. It's fun and takes this game from being an incompetent piece of sh*t to 'a piece of sh*t i hated but grinded for 35 hours because I am a completionist.' 

I didn't like this game at all guys. I'm sorry if I offended you with of my language but I had to let this out.

PROS:
The system of enemy captains vying for leadership positions and getting bonuses for defeating you and/or other enemies makes for an epic story.  It's taken a whole lot of good from Assassin's Creed and similar games: 
* A normal view and a 'spot the secrets' view (in Assassin's Creed it was a digital view; in this it's a spirit world view).
* Getting to the top of key towers to reveal map segments and side missions.
* Mostly a good mix of stealth, melee, and ranged combat.
* Flee from melee and hide in bushes to return to stealth mode.

The ""interrogate the 'worms' to reveal secrets about the captains"" feature, giving it a bit of a detective/investigative feel.  

Secret tunnels off map.  

A bit of mystery and exploration to the story.


CONS:
* Frustrating controls.  Nowhere near as smooth as something like Assassin's Creed.  Walking is fine.  Running and sneaking send you off at weird angles as the system seems to register everything in 45 degree increments.  This is a major problem when half the side missions involve either sneaking or fine targeted archery.

* Disjointed landscaped that comes with two bugs:
  - An annoying 'invisible block' bug, where parts of the map (especially caves and tunnels) act like they have invisible walls.  You have to move back, left, right, forward, roll a bit, move forward again, etc, to walk along a clear path.
  - A game-ending 'stuck in the wall' bug, where you get trapped in uneven segments of walls while sneaking along the top, or where you get trapped off map in some rocky areas.  (If you do persist with the game despite these, and you get stuck - make sure you quit the game rather than wait till you slip out of the map even further and die: dying powers up the enemies).

* And the enemy captain vying for leadership thing is actually a little backwards.  If you're doing well at the game, the leaders don't level up as much, so the game gets easier.  If you're doing poorly, the leaders level up a ton, so the game gets harder.  (=Skilled players don't get the challenge they need.  Struggling players see it spiral out of control).  Great idea, but could've been thought through a bit better.


SUM:
The awkward controls and buggy landscape make it unworth even discount prices.  A real shame, because it feels like an impressive game hiding behind all this.

GFX
The design of the charcters and orcs are nice but the open fields seem to be barren and unreaslitic structure wise) besides the fact that fortresses dont seem  that great.

Character Progession
lvling up  was the only reason why i did most of the generic missions, so yeah just to get the additional skills i wanted to try of whom which some are very nice/imaginative.

Story/char development
Story was a little bit too bland. The premise is great but the execution is meh at best. You never really HATE the black hand and the main characters always kinda stay the same so it  was kinda dull.

Nemesis system
The System is a nice gimmick but that is all what it was for me.

That's my main complaint really, It took about 2/3rds of the story to finally get me to try a decent mechanic, one that [i] may [/i] have drawn you towards the game, The Nemesis System. Sure, it'd probably ruin the flow of the game if this was available as soon as you start the game, but this is, arguably, what the game was built on so introducing it so late is pretty pants, in my opinion.

This game, for me seemed more of a chore than me having fun in all honesty. The only time I was gripped was in a later mission where [spoiler] You have to brand all the Warchiefs.	[/spoiler] 

Seeing this in my library, I didn't feel like I wanted to jump right back into the bleak looking worlds. Instead, I'd delay it. It only got to the point of wanting to clear my backlog and all my friends playing it did I decide to give this a go.

This unfortunate bit of excremental design is made worse by the fact that there is A LOT of combat, so unless mindless button-mashing is your thing, you will be bored.

What the game does well is story-telling.  For fans of fantasy and/or LOTR specifically, this is a nice bit of narrative.  The dialogue and voice acting are both good quality.

1700,3,0.3327,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","At the time of writing this review, I have applied a mere 9 hours into this game. I have stated this because I feel that in my opinion this game is a lacklustre, incredibly repetative and excessively boring. I have not completed the game as of the reasons stated above and other reasons in which I should explain. 

Starting off with the ""pros"" of Shadow of Mordor, the story is what got me into playing more of the game as it pretty much leads you straight into combat right from the first 10 minutes in which I played, it wastes no time going over petty little things such as characters that have no meaning or potential or a story that makes you think ""Gee here we go again"". I enjoyed the first moments as they show you basic combat skills and a small portion of the story that the game holds. 

The visual appearance of the game, I was astounded that the game held a decent look to it and made you feel as if you were part of the game's world in certain moments. I found this quite entertaining and kept me amazed for some time.

Unfortunately, the game also comes with a fair amount of ""cons"". Sit back and if you make it through, well good on you, you get 10 points.

The game is poorly optimized for AMD users, yes for you dumbfounded people, the game was made for use of Nvidia but I wouldnt of thought that would have effected me in anyway as I have played many other Nvidia based games using AMD software. I currently use a Sapphire RX 460 2GB GPU and a FX 6300 CPU and I had major game breaking issues within the game. I originally ran the game game on Ultra and had no issues with low framerates what so ever, I had mananged to achieve a solid 60fps until almost every 15 minutes or less the game would stutter and lag so bad that I could possibly count every single frame that passed by. This would stay this way for a maxium of maybe 10 minutes resulting in me having to lower the game's settings down to medium just so it was playable. I had updated my drivers and done nearly anything possible to solve this interference and not a single method worked apart from lowering everything down to medium.

Next, the game lacked so much, the map for starters was so small I think a hobbit's cock was bigger than it. Every single Uruk or Orc had what seemed to be the same damn British or Scottish (I presume) accent, it really took away from the game's atmosphere. The AI was also a big pain in the ass as it could be extremely smart at times and at others it was so dumb and stupid that Justin Bieber himself could have looked like Einstein (yes that bad). 

The combat was so damn easy, I never felt challenged one bit, and as I recall I don't that a difficulty level was even applied into the game. The only ever time I gained pure hatred over the combat was when I could take on 30+ Uruks in a fight and right at the end of the brawl, some archer that was located nowhere near my field of view could 1 tap me in an instant. Now this seems like I am having a sook, well believe what you want but I find it overwhelmingly idiotic that some normal enemies that you usually put up I nice game of fisty cuffs with can easily 1 tap you within a blink of an eye.

Fortress reinforcements, well that is very foolish to classify it as reinforcements as all it is, is an open spawn point of every motherfucking enemy you can think of put right in the midst of battle, that's right, when reinforcements are called, might as well hold onto your ass and scream as it never ends. You can kill them but everytime you do, another just spawns and it happens to be so damn infuriating because if you want to challenge yourself because the combat is far too easy and want to take down waves of enemies, you simply cant as it never ends.

I could name more and more dislikes I have about this game, but I feel as if no one has even made it past the first paragraph of this review either because they are lazy and are too slack to even bother, they cant read (odd but expected) or they find that I am just a ""simple minded cockhead, with an eager to hate on every game that exists, I should go back to COD and go fuck someone's mother"". Well if that happens, I know they are either mentally challenged such as myself or, they hate everyone that makes reviews as they contain too many profanities or a jumble of words that look astoundingly large and look like someone who graduated from Harvard with a Dipolma of teacher's pet would use or it simply isnt their review because their review makes everyone elses look like a New Zealander trying to fondle with someone's goat.

Gameplay wise all you get from the game is either holding down a (run), sometimes a (run) and rt (stealth) or sections where you mash buttons like: "" X X X X Y X X X Y X X X X Y X X X X Y ..."" and later in the game when theres ""new"" enemies: ""A X X X A X X X A X X X Y...

Infinite spawning orc's anywhere, you can take over every ork in s strong hold start a warcheif fight and it resets all the orc's so you waste your time. I saw orks constatly spawn in one spot even though there was no alarm set off and hte boss had no way to alert them. I started to skip the story after the second half it was just so uninspiring. If i could sum up this game in one word it would be uninspiring. Oh yead quick time event last boss."

Nice lore for an LOTR fan, fun and interesting collectibles, interesting system with use of enemies having varying strengths and weaknesses. The combat while fun makes the game feel much more like a console port with the repetitive use of the same keys for nearly every move. Nemesis system while interesting leaves a lot lacking, numerous times I met a foe that acted like we had some grand battle while he just ran off after setting off one his fears. Not to mention the Jesus orc, I killed the same guy 5 times within the span of 15 minutes. While it could be used to for interesting game play, it breaks immersion when I'm sitting there thinking “there is no way he is returning after I chopped his head off”. Lastly the reason for not recommending is that  while 70% of the game is fun, interesting, with limited farming, the last 30%  the game flat out cheats. The stronger enemies prove a bit more difficult but never overpowered however every fight(even just with captains) one or two additional captains come out making it impossible. So you're left either trying to survive long enough make a combo to kill one, or kitting them away to the far corners where you still have a 50/50 shot of another captain joining in."

The combat and upgrade systems were good, but 
 - the mouse sensitivity is tied to the framerate

 - there is a maximum of 2 save slots
 - the performance isn't really good [b]however,[/b] on linux there's a vulkan beta, which is much better, but sadly vulkan doesn't play nice with my system. (40 mins of smooth performance then a drop to unplayable fps whenever i move my mouse even a tiny bit, this is vulkan in general, not this game specifically) 
 - no fov slider, and the fov is very low (the linux vulkan beta has one though)
 - the controls are kind of janky, I have a keyboard, I don't need 8 actions bound to one button, I don't want to grab and throw that enemy 5 times, I want to pick up that item.
 - the climbing is very unresponsive and rarely does what I want
 - the orc intros, my god, the orc intros. This is a game, not a movie, I don't want to spend 2 minutes on every fight just watching enemies introduce themselves, say they're going to run away, or show that I activated their weaknesses/buffs."
1718,3,0.4213,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","OK I just finished the game. Let's get this over with.

Story:
To sum it up, Mordor is a closeted homosexual living inside a wall with his wife and son. After the wall gets attacked by zombies, he must fight hordes of black people and defeat Satan with the help of his ghost boyfriend.

OK the story SUCKS. The characters are bland and cliche, the main antagonists are pretty much edgy satanist eighth graders and there is some weird naked man who is FORCED into the story because he appeared in that movie and he is famous and shit. After a while, I just didn't care and skipped the cutscenes - except the ones with the dwarf guy, who is pretty much the only ''good'' character. 

BUT

The black men are great, and I wish they gave the captains more relevance. There was this guy named Forza Horizon who kept killing me and taunting me and came back after I ''killed'' him. THAT was great. That guy was a better villain to me than any of the living fedoras I killed with a few quicktime events. The captains actually had a lot of personality, and I would have been happier if I was up against Forza Horizon in the story a bit more. I hated his guts, but I supported him with his affairs with other captains. It was amazing and actually felt like an adventure.

Gameplay-Stealth: Well, the AI is horridly idiotic. They won't see you even if you are in front of them, and if they see you you can just run at them and kill them before they call their buddies. Also, the game doesn't even let you be stealthy at times, and doesn't have that much freedom.

Gameplay-Combat: The game features the standard combat of Batman and Assassins Creed games. In my opinion this shit has to end, I hate this system. A lot of the times, I felt like I was waiting for the fight to just end already. I used the classic Video Game Explosive Barrels™ a lot, because I simply didn't want to fight them for hours, spamming clicks and sometimes right clicks. The enemies commit fucking cellular mitosis, and they just don't stop coming. Don't even get me started on ''boss fights'', which were just glorified quick time events.

World: The world of MESOM simply feels plastic. It is just the same sidequests copied and pasted. The world around you is dead and mostly consists of ruins and empty lands. There are enemies scattered around everywhere, and they aren't even doing interesting stuff. A lot of the time they are awkwardly standing around. 

It isn't the worst game, but it is far from great. You might enjoy this if you are a big fan of Middle Earth. Other than that,there are way better options around. I give this a 5/10. It's OK..."

Good game in concept, continued ideas and storyline from LotR, but very rote and repetitive in game play, quests, missions, etc... Good AI ladder system (Nemesis whatever) for promotions, etc... but I hate having to watch it go through who is promoted where. Also like most FPS they throw in a few cut scenes and think that it makes a complete story. And too much ""story"" for an FPS. I recommend it, but only if you get a free-play weekend or ""Buy-it-for-a-buck"" discount. But big spoiler here...you get to fight one major guy (I forget his name) but any of the others is a bunch of ""push the right button"" cut scenes, WTF? I play a game so I can fight the big boss...not watch a buch of cut scenes and push a few buttons at the right time. I can't tell you how f'n disappointing that was. Really ruined the game for me.

Changed my mind, it's got a good fight engine but it's a dbag of a game. Claim open-world but forces you into a line of questing, forces you into a combat type. And I've gotten stuck in a few spots, everytime my guy runs near a wall he has to hump it, and there are rocks that I can't climb? WTF?

    Tedious Batman combat interspersed with unskippable cutscenes.
    Grindtastic.

Compared to Dark Souls:
    Souls doesn't respawn the archers while you are trying to finish backstabbing the grotto.
    Souls commands translate into entirely predictable moves.
    In Souls, I can tell who is hitting me and I know I am taking damage even if they are archers.

Pros:
[list]
[*] Lots of click to win Batman combat
[*] tons of cinematic combat.  It's fun to watch for a while
[*] $4.  I wouldn't pay more than $5, but it's a fun show for about 4 hours.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Enemies respawn faster than you can stealth kill them - you can't clear an area larger than the minimap.
[*] Hi I'm a captain and I'm going to interrupt your combo to announce myself...
[*] Hitting the target you want is hard in a fight, Hitting the wrong target can waste your combo and hard counter you.
[*] User input is queued which can break your combo if you don't correctly predict what will happen.
[*] Losing your combo because your teammate killed your target, making you miss.
[*] The camera makes this game hard
[*] In real life you'd like to be near a wall, but here that will mess up your view and kill you.
[*] story ... well It's better than the Doom 1 story.
[*] 42.7 GB download / Harddrive space
[*] Ridiculous EULA.  You aren't allowed to have the whole game on your harddrive.  Somebody should take this to court to make precedent.

The entire storyline is about 5-10 short cutscenes (its maybe around 8 minutes of story). The way to progress in the game is to complete generic boss fights. What i mean is that every boss is autogenerated in the world. Mainly the bosses are just orcs with different abilities.

The combat is very similar to assassins creed which of course means its amazing, fast and fun.

The gameplay is completionistic and you find mapped secrets to progress in levels. Its the same system as in assassin's creed.

Basically the game is a glorified kill orcs simulator.

1736,3,0.3573,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Pros:
-The animations (executions, climbing, stealth kills, etc.) are the best I've ever seen in a game I've played.  There's no clipping between the textures, and the transitions between the animations are extremely fluid.  I've never played any AC or arkham games but I guess it's similiar.
-Some of the orc captains have funny mannerisms
-The ambient orc dialogue is pretty funny.  Nice hearing them talk about how you exploded so and so's head, how they lit themselves on fire, etc.

Gamebreaking Negatives:
-The combat is absolutely awful.  It's just click left mouse and ""F"" to win, and right click when promted.  Even so it might be forgivable (since it looks so badass), except that the extreme ease of the game invalidates both the nemesis system and weapon upgrades.
-Almost every story cutscene made me cringe, i.e., ultra-melodramatic.
-The main plot is utterly boring as well as largely incoherent.  Maybe I was just too bored to pay attention to it.
-The stealth mechanics are ultra cheesable; the orcs are literally blind.  It really bothered me during the beginning of the game when there was a point to stealth (before you could consume orcs with fireballs from your eyes and bolts of lightning from your arse).
-As if the combat and stealth weren't easy enough, if you do manage to get overwhelmed/spotted by orcs, a quick circle around a building 30 ft away and they all simultaneously give up looking for you.  You also run twice as fast as them anyways, so, yeah...

Minor Negatives:
-The story quest line is basically one long tutorial
-The final boss battle is just quick time events...
-The protaginist has ""dead"" eyes.  They look glossed over and his face has a ""creepy valley"" look to it (other characters look fine).  I only mention this because I found it absolutely repulsive.  Fortunately you can change your skin to a few of the other characters, although you'll still have to suffer through it during the already diabolical story cutscenes.
-Cutscenes galore: every warchief has two seperate cutscenes on introduction, each of his bodyguards has a cutscene, whenever you proc their respective strength/weakness (e.g. scared of fire) there is a cutscene, and the warchief/bodyguards death's can have a cutscene.

If you're after something completely unchallenging to just waste time on, then i highly recommend this game.

For better or for worse this game has nearly all of the same fighting mechanics as WB's Batman series including the infuriating undodgable double space tab of doom bullshitery. Even on normal difficulty both games are very good at making everyone rage quit at least a few times per campaign. Not because you aren't good enough, not because you made a mistake, but because the flow of battle is so rudely interupted but having to double tap my f**king space bar every so often. 

The devoloper did ATTEMPT to take steps to remedy this, such as attacking a shield-bearing opponent before they attack, but the same issue with batman still applies. Where batman was agile enough to evade a charge the second the player can read an opponent as about to attack. This does not exist in Shadow of Mordor, if you aren't idle or in the last half of an attack when you see you need to dodge tough sh*t.

All of that being said, the game has quite a few welcome improvements to introduce the world to gaming. Such as the Nemesis system. When I fight someone and either have to run to find a magic leaf or die to a shield gang bang it is pretty awesome that they enemy remembers me. Not only captains but if a lucky archer gets off a shot, suddenly this one lowly little orc is a captain himself because the boost to his reputation from killing you.

Shadow of Morder is an innovative game and a reasonable narrative, but I can't recomend it unless you love losing in a game that doesn't promote it. I can deal with games where I'm intended to try again, and again, and again, but I don't want to play one that has sometimes as much as 5 minutes inbetween dying and getting back to what I wanted to do. I fight a battle, get gang banged, sit through a 45 second animation of a slow motion unblockable attack and the guy who killed me gloating, then 30 seconds of spamming the escape button so I don't have to sit through 2 minutes of learning what gragnok the retard did to fluffy the c*cksucker. Let me get back to the game. 

One last thing to note is that Shadow of Mordor isn't like most open world games with tons of collectibles and side missions and quests. Side missions are the entire game and there is no mini games, you get into the game and you fight orcs. Thats it. Maybe some travel but its a good, simple formula that is wonderful in all the right ways. It does what it does with the only fatal flaw being one measely little combat mechanic that infuriates me."

In Shadow of Mordor you play as a half dead ranger  named Talion who after being killed along with his family is possessed by the spirit of Celebrimor, the elf smith in LOTR 2nd age, who created most of the rings that are used to control middle earth's top leadership.  The two then seek to destroy the black hand, Sauron's top military leadership, and then fight Sauron himself.

Graphics: 5/10
This isn't crysis or Witcher 3, but the graphics are pretty good for a 3 year old game.  Games like 10 years older like half life 2 have better art direction.  Setting wise the maps are pretty confusing and poorly designed, with most of the map a series of rivers and terraced hills, with old ruins on top of these hills, which you just climb on and then jump on unsuspecting orcs.  Overall the game splits up into 2 parts, The beginnig which looks like gondor/mordor, at total gray wasteland where everything looks the same and pretty underwhelming,  The 2nd part is green with grass, which looks nicer but is also pretty much looks exactly the same through out the map.  Only differences are the certain fortresses that are in certain parts of the map.  This isn't skyrim or oblivion, where you would want to wish you were there.  Bad map design compared to the game it took its combat mechanics from arkham asylum.  In arkham asylum each map section had beautiful graphics and was a part of the arkham asylum's patient wings.  But in Shadow of mordor nothing separates Tolsig's crossing to other parts of the map.  This is just boring and bad map design.  Wraith vision is also very poorly done, with color scheme of blue orcs/slaves (nearly same color) to a gray background.  In arkham asylum, it was more distinctive to distinguish foe from friend and background.

Gameplay: 6/10 w/ controller? 5/10 for keyboard and mouse.
This game is basically batman arkham asylum in middle earth, with game mechanics that don't totally fit.  This game was probably designed for consoles rather than PC.  I played mostly with keyboard and mouse, but this game looks like a console port, where you should have a controller.  You mostly fight by properly left clicking the direction of your movement key and camera, but it was difficult to control.  Sometimes you would attack in a direction you wouldn't want to.  Jump and ledge grabbing in this game was also really clunky, and really frustrating to play on keyboard.  There are also no indication which ledges and buildings and objects you CAN grab and those which you CAN'T.  This is different from arkham asylum, where you had a easy to use grapple, and glide ability to escape form enemes.  In Shadow of mordor sometimes you try to climb up certain buildings, but you can't because you arent allowed to climb it.  Poor coding also means you can't jump off certain objects in certain directions, so if you are low health you are probably gonna die.  No glide from arkham asylum means you dont know the distance you are jumping and may miss a ledge grab.  This game is much worse than Arkham asylum, which I also played with Keyboard and mouse.
There are orc captains you have to assasinate or mind control to create an army against Sauron.  Each captain/warchief has strengths and weaknesses, which you can use against them.  MIndcontrol low level orcs to use against their leaders and use them to discover their strengths and weaknesses.  The game is hard in the beginning, if you dont have most abilities,  I would reccomend you do mostly main quest lines to level up until you get at least the mindcontrol abiility, and the execute ability before doing the rest of the game.  After these 2 abilities the game gets much easier.  Other than some very frustrating flaws and a final end boss fight consisting of mostly quick time events, the game has pretty good replayability, if you like assasinating/ stealth and planning games.  Warning: If you die alot to certain orc captains, they get really strong, and the game can become very frustrating.  If you are easily frustrated, refrain from playing this game.

Story: 2/10

If you like lord of the rings, especially the ""the Hobbit"" movie series, The story of this game is proabably enough.  If you wanted something deeper and less stupid, you will probably be disappointed in the character acting/reactions to events, and the boring and forgetting cast of friends in the game, with the cliche, dwarf, elf and human sidekicks.

Overall: 4/10
I wouldn't buy this game.  POORLY made game to cash in on the LOTR franchise.  Incredibly overrated by critics.  Silly to think of this game as GOTY material."

Graphics: 7/10 - Even as a game that's three years old, it still looks pretty darn good.
Sound: 5/10 - Soundtrack is good, voice actors are average, foley is all right.
Gameplay 3/10 - This is where the game really bombed for me. The combat is quick, flashy, and smooth, but it feels very overused in that it's ""protagonist fights a group of enemies, using direction input and counter attacks to block enemies.""

Buy it on sale if you really want it. But I'd skip it even if you're a LotR fanboy."

1778,4,0.6792,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","I really wanted to like this game.  It was a good game visually, and it seemed like I was going to enjoy it, then I got in a fight with my first warlord.  My tale of woe.......

He was surrounded by a big group of mobs.  My strategy was to pick of the mobs with arrows, then go in for the kill.  Only had like 6 arrows, had to go replenish my arrows, and then when I picked off enough mobs, more mobs came to replace them.  WTF!?!?

I continue this strategy, but then 2 of his mobs, for some reason, become warcheifs!!!  WTF!?!?

So, I decide, enough of this nonsense, arrows aren't working.  I go in and do melle (arrows didn't work on the main guy btw).  I'm able to take out the trash mobs, and continually roll around and avoid getting hit.  So, time to take out the main bad guy, while avoiding the 2 other warcheifs I spawned.  I go in to hit him with a melle strike, and nothing!  NOTHING!!!!  I can't damage him with arrows!!  I can't damage him with melle!!  WTF!?!?

As soon as I try to damage him, he counter attacks, hits me, and takes away 70% of my health in one hit!!  Then, one of his warcheifs hits me, and I'm fucking dead.  Was trying to kill this guy with hit and run tactics for about 45 minutes.   WTF!?!?

How am I rewarded for my struggle?  When I die, I get a cutscene of all the warlords.  The main one, and the 2 other ones I somehow created, all get promoted, and level up!!  WTF!?!?  It wasn't hard enough already!?!?

So, in the last throws of a desperate man, I go to the internet.  There's no specific info on boss fights, because they're all randomly generated.  It says sometimes the bosses have certain vulnerabilities that you can exploit if you get into the mind of a certain trash mob.  They're marked on the map, so I found one, and decided to go hunting.  I find him, with 10 of his buddies.  I'm on a kill fest (either the fights are extremely easy or difficult in this game), and end up killing the guy who I'm supposed to get the info from.  ARGGGG!!!!!!

I go find another, kill his buddies, finally get the info out of his head, and the info for the warcheif.  His vulnerability??  He's scared of those big monster things you can mount.  So, I have to unlock the ability to mount these things, go find one, mount it, then I might have a chance of killing the guy from before.  The catch??  I need ability points to unlock it.  How do I get ability points you might ask??   Wait for it............BY KILLIN FUCKING WARLORDS!!!  How the fuck am I supposed to get ability points to skill up and kill warlords if I can't kill warlords!?!?

At this point, I decided I had enought of this nonsense and quit playing.  I want to enjoy my Saturday night.  This game was just pissing me off.

In Summary:  It's on sale for 15 bucks now.  If that includes all the DLC shit, but it.  It has very nice visuals, and some people like really challenging games.  I'm not one of those people.  It was frusterating and repetitive.

A good alternative:  The same studio made Mad Max.  The play control is almost the same as this game.  I think they realized they made this game too hard, and corrected that with Mad Max.  If you're a fan of the Genre, and it's on sale, that is a much better game."

1781,3,0.3106,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","What can I say? I got it for 5 bucks.

The game itself is pretty mediocre with an incredible boring and simple combat system that looks good but absolutely requires not a single bit of skill at all. The captains and warchiefs have mechanics to make things harder like that they are immune to ranged attacks or you cant parry their attacks but you usually just still run up to them even if there is a horde and kill them.

Why? Well because the gameplay looks like the following:

go up to him, spamm attack button all day and every here and there press a button for a crit/execution. You then also press another button each time someone attacks from whatever direction and you magically parry everything automatically by pressing it and got lots of time to press that button just fine everytime, 0 difficulty involved. You also even TP to the guy who attacked you to parry him..so yeah..extremely simplified system so the 5 year old 0815 casual can play it.

Also due to the combat being so automatic, alot of times you wont be able to attack the guy or do the action you like. Want to strike a cage open while an orc is nearby to open the door of the imprisoned beast? nope your guy will always strike the ork.

If you enjoy such a simple and boring combat go for it, anyone else go for something like Dark Souls 1 or 2.

The only good thing I can really talk about is that the story seems nice and the voice actors do well and I guess if you are a fan of LOTR there is alot about lore. The rest is mediocre-average with a way too simple combat system. I am not joking when im telling you that a 5 year old can play that easily. Its so rare you ever have to watch out for something because barely a trait that the enemy captains have is truly dangerous."

(Very repetitive button masher in a LotR setting)

============

Review:

Okay, I played the game through once and collected all artifacts etc.

So how do I feel about the game?

Short version: 

It is a crude, very repetitive, button mashing game.


Longer version:

At first it feels like an actually good game, but after an hour or two you will see just how repetitive it gets.
There's only a few types of enemies that you beat over and over again, just like in a Dynasty Warriors game.

At first the combat system feels well done, that is when you fight a few enemies at a time. However, most of the time you will be swarmed with 20-30 orcs at the same time and it becomes a simple button masher which gets boring very, very fast. 

While the story is ok, the game is artificially extended through stupid collecting of artifacts which are not interesting at all. You found a bag of weed. Yay. You can now rotate it around and look at it. Not to mention the only ""quest"" besides the main story you get is ""Rescue the Slaves"".

You have to do the ""Rescue the Slaves"" quest 24 times during the game. It's the same quest always, and the Slaves are carbon copies of each other. They all wear the same clothes, they all look exactly the same. So you're basically just saving clones. Boring...

Now, the game gives you the illusion you can make a difference, such as killing orc captains to weaken Saurons army. But no, you won't make a difference, it's simply a never-ending cycle. You kill a captain, and it will be replaced soon. You can keep killing them, and they come back.

It would be more fun if you actually could kill them permanently and significantly reduce the number of enemies by doing it, but no.

So okay, I did finish the game, and I didn't like it much. Sure, it looks quite pretty, runs smooth and the voice actors are good. But the rest of the game is just boring button masher, with annoying quick-time events.

Maybe I'm just getting too old for these button mashers, and kids like this stuff.

Anyway, If you want to try this, get it on sale. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't.

============

Summary:

The Good 👍
+ Looks alright
+ Runs smooth even on older hardware
+ Good voice actors

The Bad 👎
- Extremely repetitive combat
- Lacks variation
- Lacks quests
- Boring collectibles 
- Annoying quick time events"

I mean that, in principle, enemies should always be finite with finite numbers (or a finite number of infinite spawn points) and must face the problems of moving men and mateerial from those finite number of infinite spawn points onto the battlefield. The effect of this is that in order to win, I must be able to gain control of the battlefield by making it so the enemy MUST be in position X and CANNOT be in position Y. Specifically, if I raid a fort with a single drawbridge, and clean it out then go face a chief on the drawbridge, with my back to the cleared out fort, then I should not need to worry about my rear. Or, if I chess-move a chief into a 1:1 duel, then he should not be able to teleport a squad of troops in to protect himself. Extremely annoying!! 

Also, the game is over-sold on the player's ability to control the enemy chiefs. A number of them are immortal until the plot advances. This is Wrong, even if the player must toggle to the wraith dimension and hunt their ghost as it tries to go to it's respawn point...

Action is brutal and enjoyable.  If the executions ended with limb eviscerations, instead of just the head choppings, it would add more variety to the killings and keep the pace of combat flowing more smoothly.

The story isn't necessary.  Would've been better if it was you and a special squad dropped into Mordor, and your task was to disrupt the enemy as much as possible.  Then go nuts kid, have a ball.  Keep it simple.  Provides coop capability then as well.

The lands are boring but pretty.  Make it flatter, provide a larger space to roam, more alcoves with Orcs in it, and less rocks and cliffs which are in the game now that I can only presume try to provide the illusion of a larger area (and fail).  I'm assuming later games will take place outside of Mordor to take better advantage of the multitudinous splendors of Middle Earth.  

You can jump right into the game off the bat which is fantastic.  

Combining with a ghost?  Lame.  Should've collected rings of power or some wizard bobble shit from warlords and treasure troves.  Makes everything seem far too easy, and that makes gameplay less challenging.

1799,3,0.462,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Mediocre. I got this game after the free weekend for 4 bucks, but even then it's ''Ok'' at best. This game focusses way too much on its nemesis operating system wich is boring enough as it is. 

But the main issue I have with this game are those little freaking annoyances that some games suffer from. The free running aspect is cool, but there are some objects you can climb and jump over, and some that you cant. Wtf? Either make them all interactive or just don't go the A.C route at all. It really takes away the fun when moving around. 

Some other issues; when you kill mobs, you'll only have to turn yourself around and turn back for them to re-appear. Really? This in (2014) 2017? The map is VERY small. No real crafting system. All slaves / npc humans have the same texture skin and voice. Stuff like that. Annoyances.

On a technical note: Its a wonky console port, mouse and keyboard controlls are dead awefull. There are a thousand diffrent keys you need to use for simple combat, WONKY. Framerate can fall at times and I even found some sound bugs where at some point my sound just completely dissapears."
1800,3,0.4724,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I only played for an hour and a half during a free weekend after coming to the conclusion that this game is not for me. I do not think it is a bad game at all but I am more interested in story-driven/role-playing games. So take my review with a large grain of salt: I was only experimenting with going out of my comfort zone and looking for something to occupy my weekend.

I have no particular interest in the Lord of The Rings universe so I could only recognize a handful of the dozen or so words of jargon that pepper the dialogue right from the start. I'm sure these terms are explained in some lore pages in the menus but since my intention was to just have a quick look at the game I could not be bothered to read them. This made the following the story somewhat difficult. In general I found the story (or what little of it I played) to be mechanically sufficient (being locked into Mordor, giving you some reason to kill this dude, and then this one, and then the next one, etc.) but boring content wise. I have no idea what the first 15 or so minutes of tutorial in the beginning was supposed to be. For a brand new player to the LOTR games it was a confusing ride through disjointed scenes, a very odd way to start a game. Perhaps the deeper meaning of these are explained later but it definitely did not work in favor of the game.

I wasn't in it for the story anyway. I did a fair bit of combat since that appears to the core focus of the game and I could definitely see some interesting mechanics in play with the captains and runes but my combat eventually devolved into button mashing. Perhaps there is greater depth to found later (perhaps additional mechanics are unlocked?) but I had little trouble dancing around in the middle of a dozen orcs mashing the attack button and counter when prompted, trying to find an opening to slit the throats of downed orcs. It was quite repetitive.

The alright freedom of movement (tall cliff faces only slightly slow you down), lack of fall damage, passable stealth mechanics, and the short-sightedness of the orcs make for rather arcade-like gameplay which (to me) emphasize the fact that you are here to kill orcs by the battalion and nothing else. Ultimately the final nail in the coffin for me was the impermanence of the world: everything seems respawn after you literally turn your back on them. I understand that Mordor is supposed to be swarming with orcs but it was extremely frustrating to first slaughter a group of orcs at a camp and freeing their human slaves, then climbing up a very nearby cliff to look down at the camp only to see that the bodies of the orcs were now gone and a band of fresh orcs have respawned along with the human slaves. There appeared to be an area liberation mechanic and perhaps this kind of instant respawning no longer happens when you have liberated an area but it is incredibly demoralizing to see that your actions have no effect on the world. Perhaps that was the intention of the developers?

Really, an hour of gameplay is not enough to get a proper feel for a game of this scale but I had seen some gameplay videos beforehand that made me curious about the combat and captain mechanics in particular. More than anything I wrote this review to remind myself in the future that I did not like the game but I've made it public in case other people are interested in my first impression of it."

Pro's 
- there are a few moments in the game you feel really epic
- it's fun to command orks

Con's 
-Its an exact copy of assassins creed just lord of the rings. Same controls, same story progression, same repettitive crap.
-If you know anything about the lord of the rings story and I mean anything the story is not only not cannon it is directly conflicting to the books.
-Not only that but the story is ludicris. In summary Sauron makes you his worst enemy and gives you immense power for no reason other than I guess he has a death wish? Also you get a ton of blasting powder to take out an army and its all you have and your character decides to use it to blow up a statue instead of anything useful. 
-you cannot command your orks to do anything directly basically they act like you don't control them till you are near and fighting then they just help, cant tell them to attack or follow. you can tell them to fight another leader but only 1 at a time and it's a very repetitive process for grinding forward in the story. 
-it took me less than a day to beat and i was cleaning the house as I played. 

Don't get me wrong it has it's positives but im glad i got to play it for free. I would say it's worth the 4 bucks if it's on sale to kill a day but not worth anything more for sure."

The gameplay gets repetitive quickly, and doesn't even match up to the flow of Assassin's Creed. The game also features a pretty boring world map that is a complete slog to sprint through on the way to missions. If you're hoping to play through a cinematic story (Like me), this game is too busy trying to throw it's half-functioning ""Nemesis"" system at you to distract you from its other shortcomings.

It's a console port so the pc keybinds are horrid and can't be altered enough to make it work properly.  The need to click the right key combo at exactly the right time works for controllers with dozens of buttons but on a keyboard mouse setup it just plain makes the game suck.  If you have a controller, enjoy, if not, then don't waste your time or money on this.  There's no real way to alter the key binds so it becomes a matter of using the same two mouse buttons with space and left control to accomplish everything.  Jump, run, dodge, parry, block, counter, all use the same control so it's all about timing.  Need to block an attack?  Press the mouse button at the right time, oh, too soon so you attack someone else and get hit from behind.  Ports like this should just not happen.  If the developers can't be bothered to make their game work properly on the platforms they release it on, they should just not bother porting it to that platform."

Quick Overview: Definitely a ""fun"" version of assasin's creed, but the horrible design elements of those games plague this one as well.

Cons:
-HUGE Fps drops in random intervals and when too many enemies are on screen
    -somehow alleviated during wraith vision which doesn't make sense

-Arkham Asylum combat with very little improvement

-fights can easily turn into dynasty warriors as orks keep spawning in
    -other captains can join in the fight with their squads and make things worse
    -archers can make these fights almost impossible (especially captains with crossbows)
    -Why the huge fps drops are a major issue

-interact is same button as grab (can't grab runes around captains)

-end game abilities probably require alot of grinding
 -probably gets too easy with said abilities

-dodging attacks from parrying enemies sometimes doesn't work

-ghul enemies are usually in groups of HUNDREDS

Pros:
+Collectathon bs kept to a minimum (Only 4 towers, collectables only restore health or give you xp)

+Awesome abilities that make arkham combat less tedious

+Environmental hazards to take out groups of enemies, making stealth less tedious

+Stealth is more a tool than a necessity (in most situations)

+One of few games where crouch stealth isn't fucking slow

+I hate Lord of the Rings, yet I was interested in the story

+Ranking and power mechanic works well enough to make the encounters more interesting"

Shadow of Morder suffers from being a ""bit too much of a game"", much like Horizon: Zero Dawn and multiple Batman games, that have all received iconic status as being ""amazing"".  So take my opinion as a grain of salt, as I'm obviously disagreed with.  You smash a button, block, smash a button.  It's much like a QTE on rails, except you can wander to the next place (with nothing in between) yourself.  So the combat became very boring for myself and the wife, which is unfortunately the primary draw of these games.  All that we had to carry us after that was the story, which was delivered few and far between.

The nemesis function, however, was interesting, and the sole reason I'd recommend it on sale.  Eventually, the ""bosses"" become difficult to fight, and you can develop a story within the game as they become stronger.  I never got to experience the ending, and the greater difficulty that apparently exists, as I made it about halfway through until I shelved this game for good.  

The combat is simply that unsatisfying for me.  It feels like the game wants you to win, so you just mash a button until you do.  The animations are varied and sounds are fantastic as you mash the button, which apparently gives everyone cause to celebrate it, but it didn't cut it for me.  Perhaps I'm too old, or jaded, but the skill ceiling is very low, and the abilities to unlock are muted, at best.  Using a controller, you can get up from your desk while mashing on a button, grab a beer, kiss the wife, tickle the kid, and come back to everyone being dead.  To be fair, there are situations in which you need to focus and develop a strategy; they are few and far between, however.

I was astonished at how little substance there is to this game. The game is not very big in terms of world size, and there is very little in the world. There are very few enemy types, very few differences between abilities, very little in terms of motivation or rewards, very repetitive and basic combat and really subpar level & world design. 

The character models often look OK even if they do suffer from mid-2000s syndrome where everyone is extra chunky. 
Your eyes are CONSTANTLY assailed with terrible signs of laziness on the part of the level designers. Missing foliage, muddy textures, awful, AWFUL low poly models in REALLY obvious places. I was very surprised by how lacking the game was in quality here. Aside from the fancy modern day lighting every game has, this game looks like it could have been released at a similar quality in the early 2000s. 

Gameplay-wise, this is a shallower retread of the Arkham games. The ""nemesis system"" is just ""random orc taunts you differently if you've fought him before"". Honestly, past the first two interactions with it, I forgot this system even existed. It's not really worth a mention, let alone is it able to carry the game. Outside of the nemesis system, ALL there is to do in the WHOLE GAME is just brawl with orcs. This is fun for about half an hour. Then you've pressed X and Y more times than is fun. Locations were already repeating a bunch within the first hour as were scenarios and situations. This would be fine if the combat was engaging and fun, but ultimately it is boring, as all it has to offer is ""mash X and Y"". The game claims there is more to it than this, and it is lying. There isn't. 

Ultimately I was surprised by the low quality of this game. It plays and looks like a not-quite-whole-arsed Arkham mod. None of the screenshots or videos are an accurate representation of the game. 
 
I just don't see what there is here to justify the price. Of $4. If you want a good mediaeval brawler on a budget, get Darksiders 2 or Lords of the Fallen. Either is deeper, longer, better & more varied to play, has a much bigger game world and can be had for less. 5/10 at $4."

I've bought a lot of $4 games during the sale, from ones that were originally like $8 to begin with to AAA titles that were originally $6t0+ like this game. Even counting what I get ""for the money,"" this has to be the worst purchase I've made during the sale, possibly on Steam ever. I do concede that the game looks good, but I have three main gripes that just ruined Shadow of Mordor for me.

1. Controls are extremely clunky: Designing a control scheme around controllers doesn't mean you can't include a good keyboard+mouse control scheme...

Biggest problem is that there is no toggle option for stealth and sprint. ""Regular"" movement is a super slow walk that's slower than stealth, so I either have to hold shift or space, or both to move at any appreciable speed. I understand that a lot of people play PC games on controllers nowadays and this control scheme might be okay for controllers (I'm assuming stealth/sprint are done by holding trigger buttons), but making a control scheme well-suited to controllers does not mean you have to absolutely butcher the keyboard+mouse control. Yes, you can remap the stealth/sprint keys to slightly more ergonomic locations, but it's a never-ending inconvenience that hits you at the worst times and you never fully adapt to it.

Also, who thought it'd be a good idea to make picking up items share a button with grabbing enemies, especially in a game where combat is basically never-ending? If I killed a boss, I want to pick up my rune and see what it is. I shouldn't be denied my loot for another 15 minutes because I keep grabbing into thin air because my auto-targeting thinks I'm trying to grab an uruk.

Interaction with walls is also atrocious. As another reviewer said, I can pretty much climb any wall, which looks ridiculous in its own right. The control problem is that this climbing feels very clunky, where sometimes I'll climb immediately, and sometimes there's a noticeable delay or it simply doesn't register because I somehow didn't click into the location I have to be at in order to climb it. Comeon, this game was released in 2014. I don't think characters sliding into an invisible slot on a wall is expected in an AAA title.

2. Combat system is atrocious: Sure, it looks really cool and ""challenging"" for the first couple fights, but is it really ""good"" if it gets old that quickly?

Whatever good ideas like nemesis system, uruks fighting among themselves, abilities, etc. are rendered completely irrelevant by the mindless combat that seemingly lasts forever. It'd be fine if the combat was fun, but it's really not because I never felt like I had control over my actions other than mashing left clicks, mixing in occasional right clicks, and F every 8 attacks. The game targets enemies for me, so I constantly end up killing intel sources I wanted to keep alive, or not be able to use my finishing moves on intended targets. Sure, the combat is cinematic and looks like you're doing a lot of cool stuff from a spectator's point of view, but as a player, after maybe 10 minutes of seeing the same cinematic kills that you barely have any control of over and over again, those slo-mo killcams are just another way to make the game feel drawn out. Also, can't forget to mention practical invincibility because of how broken it is to just mash space bar for dodge actions.

I wish the enemies had higher attack damage across the board for more challenge. I wish there was actual element of timing with combat, where I have to commit to an attack/counter/dodge and have to carefully plan what I'm going to do next. On top of that, enemies should have either been lower HP and keep this swarmy-feeling, or much more challenging individuals coming in small numbers. In fact, those two could have been both included in the game to control the tempo and keep battles varied but lasting for a reasonable duration instead of two uruks joining the fight every time you kill one, making a single instance of frontal assault last 10 minutes when you've already been bored with it after the first 45 seconds.

3. Open world?: A large pit where the only thing you can do is fight ""freely"" is not an open world.

Sure, you get to fight whoever you want (kind of, unless the inevitable ""5 uruk captains just joined the fight"" happens) and can do trivial side-quests that really have no impact on the world, but is that really open world? Yes, the uruk captains change based on your killing them/getting killed by them and ""impact"" the world, but it's just another randomly generated uruk filling in for anaother randomly generated uruk with no real influence over the world.

Maybe I'm just picky, but open world means something like the Elder Scrolls series, where I can actually do things other than combat to a meaningful degree. For example, if I decide to roleplay as a warrior who pulverizes anyone in his path, I definitely can. I can also decide to roleplay as a petty thief who is afraid of killing people so he just pickpockets and steals things, sneaking around and avoiding combat. I can roleplay as a merchant, alchemist, hunter, ordinary citizen. There's none of that in Shadow of Mordor, where the only thing you can do is fight, fight, and fight, and the only freedom you have in the world is you get to half-choose if you want to fight someone now or later. I saw the ""open world"" tag and was excited to explore Middle Earth with actual interaction with the world, but climbing literally every wall is the only real interaction with the environment. On that note, being able to climb every wall doesn't reinforce players with ""wow I can go anywhere; this is a truly open world!"" kind of feeling, but just takes away from the challenge and creativity.

This is the first review I've ever written for a game, which says a lot about how disappointed I am with Shadow of Mordor. 

Bottom line: I wouldn't buy it if it was being sold for $0.99. If it's free, sure, knock yourself out for an hour or two. However, if you go by ""it's a decent deal if you've paid $1 per hour of playtime"" idea like I do, this is not a good deal."
1833,4,0.3815,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Highly overrated.

Movement is based on assasin' creed, but without any logic system: You'll be able to climb seemingly any vertical wall: This isn't a good thing.
  The area you move in, is a clusterfuck. From the early levels, you're forced to get slain by crowds of Orks/Uruks to create a fake opposition: At no point in the game will you be challenged, instead you're overwhelmed: Which is extremely demotivating; because it's completely out of your control most of the time.

Say you jump a pack of orks; well you need to spent the next 5-10 minutes dancing around the area before killing them. In  this time, 2-3 packs will join you as it's impossible to not attract attention. If you somehow manage to not fail 3 quicktime events in those 30 minuts, you're 'rewarded' for your hard work.

All of these things wouldn't matter if the skills/runes/spells/powersups you get helps to create an interesting dynamic in these fights: Instead, the fights becomes dramatically easier.

Within 30 minuts of playing, you've experienced 90% of the game - only difference is the name of the orks and what buttons you press. End result is the same.

Refunded, not worth my time."
1834,3,0.4905,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Mind-numbingly boring. There is no story to it, you just run around and battle legions of orcs in one of those deus ex machina type of ways where you never take any damage at all, trying to get combos off. 

It's like Batman Arkham without a single shred of story, a franchise slapped onto one of the most generic gameplay frames I've ever seen. 

Would not recommend it at all and even the € 4 I spent on this game during the Summer Sale are filling me with buyers remorse.

95 minutes of ""Is this seriously the game?!"".

Do yourself a favour and leave it untouched."
1835,3,0.5767,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Traversing the over-world is frustrating. Whilst there is fast-travelling, akin to Assassin's Creed, the fast-travel points are only unlocked after climbing a tower in a region and you'll have to journey to missions on foot. You're very likely to get spotted by patrols or ambushed by an uruk you killed as part of the novel nemesis system. There are a few other creatures in the game which offer some semblance of fun and give you an alternative means to navigate the open world, but it's easier to just run to your next mission.

The Combat is just button-mashing with the odd prompt to press a button to counter an attack. You'll generally be swarmed by uruks, fun the first few times, but if you're trying to take-down a warchief as part of the main game it quickly becomes tiring. The ranger mode in which you use the bow and arrow is actually good and allows for a great deal of strategy and stealth, it isn't overpowered due to the limited use of it which can be upgraded, but I found this to be the only positive aspect of the combat.

Torvin is the only fun and whimsical character in the game, you, the protagonist are very bland and constantly berate other characters in the world. Whilst the warchiefs and bodyguards have ""personalities"", they're nothing more than a one-liner at a beginning of an encounter before a fight. Characters and character development is very lacklustre.

The plot of the game is fairly simple, I'm not going to spoil any of it, but it's fairly unimaginative and brings nothing new to the table. If you're a fan of the Rings franchise you may get something out of the lore the game offers otherwise there is very little that will captivate. 

As a completionist this game is a nightmare. It is tedious collecting the artefacts and memories and most definitely a chore if you aren't interested in anything Rings related. There are slave missions in addition to 10 missions each for the sword, bow and dagger. Some are enjoyable, but you'll find yourself redoing the same mission over and over because you failed the main objective of not getting spotted. To add insult to injury you'll have to run all the way back to the mission marker to start it again, not fun at all. There are also secondary/optional objectives, but these are best ignored since they aren't necessary for 100% completion or steam achievements.

I have only played the ""Lord of the Hunt"" DLC but abandoned it shortly after. It comprises of main story missions and other side missions all centred on creatures like graugs, caragors and ghuls.

With zero crashes and a near solid 60fps experience the performance is great. At very high graphics settings (minus shadows and textures) the game is visually pleasing and options are provided to disable motion blur and depth of field effects. The game does have a drab colour palette due in part to the objects, buildings and landscapes. The atmosphere is unexciting to say the least.

The game was more burden than fun, just completing missions and finding artefacts with an uninspiring story attached. You can have fun with the sandbox elements but there is very little to actually do in the world other than kill and sneak. I picked this game up on sale for just over £3 and I'd still have a hard time recommending it."

On top of this, the parkour, fast travel, Tower reforging (Basically Viewpoints), and the district system are very much the same.

Honestly, it feels like one giant quick time event. You left click over and over until you get the option to press F to execute. Rinse and repeat. Maybe mix in a few spacebar's in there to dodge and that's it. 

The rest of the game felt like a repetitive grind to take out orcs that recycles the same few scenarios that play out the same each time. It was a slog to keep doing them just to gain more power ups and upgrades. Like one huge grind. The new areas are much the same way. Rinse and repeat in a new setting. 

I found myself not eager at all to finish this game. Not sure if I will yet. I probably will as I open the game up every so often.

I had finally managed to kill him by random chance as he happened to show up at the same time as his only weakness- a Graug. Happy ending to this story, right? Wrong. Literally four minutes later as I was doing another quest he came back to life because of fucking course he did.

Inevitably you will be surrounded by a never ending stream of enemies, many of whom require specific methods of attacking/beating.  Oh, and you won't just be fighting the captain that you are going after no, and again it does not matter if you take down the other captains in the area first, you will be fighting more than one at a time.  And they too will keep coming and coming.  Every fight, no matter how stealthy I am, just boils down to me fighting until eventually I can't keep killing.  You just can't.

Biggest issue among about a dozen (and is the only one i care to rant about in this half a$$ed review)is simply the captains showing up from every corner of the map when called upon during a fight. Nearly every fight getting 3-6 captains to show up on average is just ridiculously idiotic. Fail design and a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of idiots claiming this game is amazing.. What a combo....

To sum it up, this game plays like a batman Arkham game made for a mobile device... That's thee closest comparison i can think of.. And it's truly sad how accurate that actually is... I wanted this game to be good but it's too shallow for me to enjoy. But naturally children enjoy it, jee wiz, right!?...

Even if this game goes back on sale for 4$, like how much i got it for, it's simply not worth it imo... Anyone with half a brain can watch the gameplay and know what im talking about.

I found the storyline interesting and, loving the movies, appreciate the overall ambiance.

You move at 2 speeds, too fricking slow or too fricking fast.  
I hate the infinite orc spawns.  Just stop spawning, ffs.  
I hate how the game forces you to hunt down elites in order to progress the story, & in order to do that you first have to hunt down their body guards. It's just a time waster & it puts you in it right away & it takes hours to complete.
I hate how every time you die, all the captains respawn forcing you to hunt them down again. 

I honestly hate everything about this game.  It's fricking awful.

It's good if you wanna just endlessly kill orcs for an hour but nothing else about it is good.  It's a mindless killfest & some people may like that, but I personally don't.  I thought I'd enjoy this game because it's supposed to basically be Arkham with swords, except it really isn't.  It's like, if they took out all the things that made Arkham fun, made a crappy open world & just threw in things for you to kill & then gated half the game behind a terrible tedious quest ark that takes way longer to complete than it probably should, then you get this mess of a game."

Its story does not fulfill the pursose of amusement, it is predictable and, as far as I understand it, cares little about LOTR lore.
The missions you deal with are basically the same, but their location is changed so, is it refreshing? No. 
At first, controls are quite interesting, although once you reach a certain skill they become sort of unresponsive or buggy. I need to state that I was using keyboard and mouse, which implies that I don't know if they work better with a controller.
After completing a ~30-40% of the game, you will probably be more interested in finishing it than in the game itself. Moreover, do not expect epic final bosses or appealing mechanics, there are none. By the way, every single time you go on a mission or encounter a ranked soldier, you will be delighted with one of a large number of annoying cutscenes, even in the middle of combat, which is incredibly upsetting.

To conclude, it's cool at the outset but keeps being less and less entertaining as you play. If it's on sale, it's fine."

Really like it as an open world exploration game and especially as a parkour game. You run and flow seemlessly off objects, mountainsides, walls, etc with ease. But most of this game is running from area to area fighting big clumps of orcs. I somewhat suspect this entire game was conceived by watching the FotR movie where Aragorn clops the head off the orc. Because once you can start executing orcs in battle, you chop off a LOT of heads and stick yourt sword through lots of faces. There is a lot of batmanish fighting in this. All those huge clumps of orcs. And after a little while that gets pretty stale. I watched a movie of someone just leaping over all of them constantly by buttonmashing the spacebar and never getting hit. It was an indicator that you don't really have the control you thought in fights. I thought I was choosing my direction, etc. I actually kept getting surrounded a lot and dying but that was just because I didn't know all the controls. THing about that it seems to throw all the keys at you at once quickly in instruction and say go to it instead of letting you learn slowly and building on that. Cause it soon becomes left click button mashing with some right click thrown in. mastering that there is a bunch of cut scenes as well. All this...isn't really that fun. The cool parts of the game are that you can interrogate them and even take over their minds in the DLC (or with much later powers). Even remote domination. Until then it's kinda having to sit through a LOT of cutscenes of orcs telling you how they are going to eat you (and you can't skip past these either). It is fun when other beasts atack the orcs or they fight amongst themselves. There is a mode where you learn info about the orc captains and how they grow in power and challenge each other if they defeat you. Great concept actually . Makes you think there is a living world in there somewhere...and indeed it is a batmanlike sandbox where you come upon lots of random things to fight. But it boils down to one of those fighting games with lots of combos with cutscenes and slowmotion movies burned in. Prepare for buttonmashing.

It's graphically appealing; runs smoothly; has good voice acting; the feuds and rivalry thing with the Uruk captains is clever; and it seemed to be setting up a half-decent story (even if Tolkien would be turning in his grave). It made it to the top of many people's game of the year lists, so it must be somebody's cup of tea. 

However, an hour in and I hadn't started having fun. Excepting the time when I managed to grab an Uruk and had to repeatedly press X to shank him (which was delightful), I found the combat to be dull and lacking in depth. Just mash X until you see the counter warning, tap Y for a free stun then go back to mashing X. Occasionally tap Y AND B for an execution. Maybe it gets more interesting once you've ground through a bit and unlocked extra combos and finishing moves, but I wasn't feeling any desire to do that, it just felt like a chore. I know stealth is technically an option, but that only feels relevant when infiltrating a fort or something. I'm not stealthing my way across the entirety of that large, interesting, well laid-out, open-world map when I just want to get somewhere by dinner time.

The combat reminds me of Assassin's Creed, but Assassins Creed got away with slash-counter-stab combat because the combat wasn't what you were there for, it was merely the mustard on a lovely parkour/shanking hotdog. 

So apparently I only have fun when I'm shanking something. I don't know if that's the game's problem or mine."

Reason?

FOV is drastically zoomed in where you have no peripheral vision to tell what's going on around the character and creating a very claustrophobic feeling.

Google up a fix for this .. ""go download cheat engine and run a script.""

Um ... no.

How about your game needs to have an FOV adjustment built into the options for PC gamers.

Since game is years old, I know there won't be a patch to address this. I'm tired of bending over backwards to get console ports to PC to work and look right. I'm getting to old for that.

Much rather spend my time doing something more productive where I dont' feel like I've spent money to reward someone for treating me like a second class citizen that has to bend over backwards to get around stupid things or just suck it up and live with something awful ... all because I'm a PC gamer instead of a console gamer.

I had really high hopes for this game as it so reminded me of my beloved early Assassin's Creed series with a few Witcher associations (two swords on the back killing monsters left, right and center). 
The plot seemed rather interesting even though really AC II inspired - protagonist's family is killed and now he has to kill his enemy to avenge his loved ones. Unlocking wraith towers was very AC: Brotherhood borrowed (or at least it is so, IMO). 

However, just a few minutes into the game I got absolutely disappointed by overcomplicated combat system and instances when one fights 5 orcs and all of a sudden you have 50 enemies with three captains on your rear end, and you are only like level 2 or so. It is really overwhelming and aggravating (for me personally). I was also rather put off by inability to replay auto-saves or adjust difficulty or ability to see enemy units' life bars. With how many times one hits one orc, it should be sliced and diced. Execution doesnt proc when it whould, or I would be pressing the key to peform execute and game basically tells me to get lost and doesn't do what i tell it to.

Very meh game IMO for the following reasons:
- overcomplicated in combat system (for keyboard/mouse set up) with different key combos that u have very little time to figure out when still getting used to everything; 
- tough in the beggining and (from what I have read on reddit and forums) oversimplified in the end (shouldn't it be the other way around?!); 
- inability to replay auto-saves and being overrun at low lvl with hoard of enemies with no health bars (and you end up running away more times than fighting) that one has to slash and dash way too many times for what it's worth;
- no difficulty adjustments.

I'm just glad I only spent $4 on it instead of $30-40.

If you like any of those games, you might like this one. If you hated any of those games, then I suggest looking at a let's play before buying. Even if you've liked those games many years ago, but recently played Dark Souls even for a few minutes, buyer beware. 

There's so much good about this game. It makes you want to like it. But once you master the oversimplified gameplay, it's not a game anymore, it become a grind. You can not mod this game, you can not increase the difficulty, but you can set challenges for yourself. Challenges like never get any upgrades, rune upgrades, and never using any runes. Those are fun challenges. It keeps the fights at a more reasonable 1 vs a dozen instead of 1 vs all of 'em.

What's wrong with the game?
The gameplay. Bar none. I hated how easy it was, so I restarted twice and found the no upgrade, no revive when knocked down game. There's shitty things in the game, like not being able to pickup a rune from downed captains until you are done the mission. imho, it's too boring for a proper review. And It's 59GB with the HD pack.

Once you get the combat figured out, the game starts to shows how standard and shallow it really is.

Use stealth, and mind control every sentry/guard, then make your way to towards the big bad of the area for a quick cutscene and battle. Rinse, repeat for the entire game. There are a few side and main story missions that have you doing other tasks, but its not enough to break up the repetition.

1909,3,0.5629,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I got bored of this game really fast. It's better than the terrible Arkham games and Assassian's Creed 3, but falls short for a few reasons.

1. All of the fights are either too easy or too hard for all the wrong reasons. Generally, the only enemies that are worth worrying about are either archers (since their attacks are difficult to notice and dodge) and higher-ranking members of the army that have enough strength to one-shot you. Everything else can be cut through like butter if you're willing to mash Y or A at the right opportunity. For some reason, the game has a built-in easy mode skill named ""Storm of Urfael"" or something along those lines that lets you instakill a bunch of people for no real reason. Even Arkham didn't have something like that.

2. The nemesis system is cool until you realize that you won't die enough to use it. The only generals that have killed me come when I get wounded and leave right after poking me with their sticks.

3. Open world that's empty. I honestly can't tell if the missions repeat or not since most of the ones I've done involve stealthing around the camp and freeing a bunch of slaves. The rest either compound how bad Arkham-style combat systems are or let you shoot arrows at still targets in slow motion (which gets easier when you have the skill that replenishes focus on headshots).

4. The story has one interesting idea wrapped up into a plot that feels like a circleclique of LotR lore. Basically the whole plot revolves around you trying to find out that the Elf Lord is, in fact, the Elf Lord. Although the idea of an immortal man wishing to lift his ""curse of immortality"" so he can die and join his family is incredibly interesting to me, none of the characters felt that they had any personality aside from Gollum who was already pre-established in LotR so no props for that.

5. The game is, in the style of Arkham-likes, trying to be too many things at once and failing at most if not all of them. Does it want to be a game where the world evolves on its own if you don't come to intervene by using Sauron's Army? Does it want to be a stealth game where you sneak around attempting to free slaves without a trace? Does it want to be a beat 'em up where you go around slashing the heads of thousands? Does it want to be an exploration game where you go around finding beauty in the Land of Shadows? All the mechanics are almost as if they were made /just/ fleshed out enough to avoid any internal contradictions, but weren't expanded upon anywhere past that (i.e. in stealth, the guards will notice bodies but won't notice you crouching within their line of sight.)

Want a game where armies and generals create a world around you, waiting for someone to tip the scales in their favor? Play Mount & Blade: Warband

Want a game where you attempt to stealth around unnoticed? Play Thief.

Want a game with a big open world waiting to be explored and plundered? There's actually a lot of those around that fit the bill better than this, you can find them with a google search.

Want a game with the best usage of Arkam combat in a while? This one actually fits the bill, it rarely feels ridiculously forced and stupid. Often you can be surprised about the creative useage the powers are given in the middle of combat.

tl;dr it's not as bad as the arkham games but also isn't that good"

I did get to encounter a bit of the nemesis/warleader system and it was cool, and the game really does have that going for it.

I personally had quite a bit of trouble playing the game with a mouse and keyboard though. There were a lot of different button binds you have to manage. It felt more like I was fighting to control the game as opposed to fighting off the orcs. I did some rebinding but it didn't help much. The combat is similar to the Batman games where you spam counter and get a few hits in before you hit counter again. It's honestly pretty easy and the only real ""difficulty"" comes from fighting the warleaders. Even then the difficulty lies in reading what their weakness is and exploiting that. 

I did get killed a few times but it was just from getting attacked by like 4+ of the named orcs at once (I think I was close to a fortress or something, but I was in the first area of the game). I killed most of those orcs, but they don't remain dead if you die in the battle, which was a little upsetting but understandable I guess. The game doesn't have much of a tutorial, but I assume you learn more as you do the story missions. However I personally like to do a bit of running around when I first get tossed into an open world but I only got punished for doing that. 

The stealth is also incredibly simple, but seems to one of the big points of the game. You can assassinate orcs feet away from their allies, and so long as you are a little behind them they won't notice. I also see the movement praised by some people, but it is as simple as ""hold _ button and run toward a wall"". 

I don't usually write reviews but I've only heard good things about this game and was pretty surprised when I actually got my hands on it. I'm still holding out some hope for new Mordor game coming out, but it'll likely be more of the same.

TLDR
The game seems to be best played with a controller imo.  The combat is uninventive/boring (still imo). I obviously didn't play very much so take this all with a grain of salt. Although while its on sale I'm sure you could easily get $4 worth of fun out of it."

I've recently been playing Dark Souls III, and that game has better survivability than this poorly designed, not well thought out game, with fun elements in combat, but terrible mechanics in terms of Captains and Nemesis.

I've never been a big fan of the Lord of the Ring franchise, but the story so far is so underwhelming, I've played for God knows how long, and the story is basically non existant. You'd think with so much material from the lore to work with, they'd make a better story, at least to balance out the awful Nemesis mechanic...

Its quite fun and the story is great but the game is extremely repetitive in game-play. Getting through the story gets a slog real quick.

[B][U]My advice: Its good but there are other adventure games that do it better. [/U][/B] So only get if you'r massively into LotR or cant get enough of 3rd person adventure games.


Pros: 
- Great Story
- Interesting gameplay mechanics (nemesis system)

Cons:
- Repetitive missions. All of them are basically the same: Kill Captain, help other Captain kill Captain, help monster kill Captain
- No real variation in how to approach missions (Sneaking is often the only way which is slow and gets boring fast)
- Nemesis system is fun for a while but then turns into a HR management game quick.
- Getting interrupted ever 2min by intro cut-seen from yet Another new Urug Champion. (this can happen 6+ times in a row during a bossfight, which breaks the ""fun flowing combat"" to bits.

1947,3,0.6851,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Shadow of Mordor is a game that only fanboys n girls will be able to truly enjoy. There is very little content to be had outside of reading the appendicies and learning a bit more about Mordor. Combat is extremely easy, even unleveled you can pretty much walk into a stronghold and take on the entire populace, captains don't provide much more of a challenge. By midgame you're unstoppable, especially if you have any sort of health restoration runes equipped, and if you do manage to unlock even one of the three final powers for your weapons you'll mow down even the most difficult foes with ease. 

Ultimately where this game failed is I feel like I've played it before but better. It feels like a rip off of assassins creed set in mordor with only an easy mode available. The environment also does not change much, for the shadowy realm of mordor they could have made some really intriguing enemies and environments to play around in, but they took zero risks in doing that. The environment does permenantly change to a new area midway through which is refreshing, but ultimately just another bland environment.

Where it does succeed as I mentioned is the Lore and the story telling. It's a typical story, but if you enjoyed LOTR the cutscenes will keep you going through the game til the end. 

The one unique feature everyone totes on about is the captains having their own hierarchy, but given that there is no real AI running it, it's pretty hallow. The orcs don't wander the map in real time and actually engage eachother, you can't drop eaves or stir up a rivavly between two captains. The AI literally just picks at random which captains are fighting, and going to succeed eachother. There isn't much depth to it at all. 

Combat - 5/10
Graphics - 8/10

Giving it a thumbs down feels a bit harsh for all that it offers at such a small price (GOTY edtion for 5 bucks!), but it's just not quite enough to recommend it. 

The gameplay is just too repetitive and battles are frustrating. You have a quest to take down an Uruk captain...so you go to him to start the battle. You're fighting him and his underlings, battle is challenging but going well...but wait! Now another Captain appears! And he has his own crew. So now you are fighting two captains (boss-type enemies) and a huge gang of other minions. This is going to be really tough. BUT WAIT! There's more! Now ANOTHER captain shows up from out of nowhere and now you're fighting 3 captain uruks. Surely another Captain won't show up randomly 10 seconds later, right? Wrong. Meanwhile, the main Uruk you came to defeat for the quest decides to flee the battle, and runs away at 35 mph like he's the Usain Bolt of Mordor, while you are surrounded by a ton of other minions and Captains.

Rinse and repeat.

I do like the world and character design (uruks are really cool looking!) and the graphics are really nice for a 2-3 year old game. Great voice acting as well.

There are some fun moments, but not quite enough. It is not bad by any means, just maybe not worth your time. I would recommend Mad Max over this game if you haven't played either.

I myself logged around 15 hours on it. But I won't be finishing the game. I think it would have been a pretty good game except for the save system. Auto-save is okay when it accompanies voluntary saves. Otherwise, autosave alone has to be exceptionally well handled in order for it to work. Unfortuantely, that isn't the case with ME:SoM. The game saves AFTER significant events in the game. And there is only one save file. I generally save frequently on video games. And I make sure to save BEFORE I go into a dangerous situation. That way, I can reload and try again if I fail. With the save system here, if you come out extremely low on health potions, etc, you are forced to start the entire game over again from the beginning. If it weren't for the auto-save problem, I would give it a thumbs up. Of course, I would probably have finished the game."
1955,4,0.4311,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Shadow of Mordor had a promising start.  Its nemesis system is unlike anything I have ever seen in a game - unique, intuitive and above all punishing if you die.  It definitely made the world come together and make you feel part of something special if only at the beginning.  Ordinary orcs who kill you get promotions and an increase in power.  There are captains of varying ranks superceded only by the ultimate warchiefs who are far and away the toughest enemies to take down because not only can they absorb hits for days, but they are also protected by strong bodyguards.  Some sort of strategy is necessary in taking these guys out.  In order to gain an advantage on tougher orcs, you will need to find intelligence from either lesser orcs or scattered in the world which reveal an enemy's strengths and weaknesses.

Unfortunately, while the world is fairly big, it is laughably empty, lacking any substance.  The missions offered are regurgitated content through and through.  Take for example the outcast missions - here you are tasked with freeing a handful of slaves from orcs each time.  Sounds fun, right?  Well you have a whopping 24 of them to do total.  What makes these missions somewhat entertaining is due to the variety of ways to fight.  

You can use your bow and kill orcs from afar, go in head first and dice everything up with your sword (not recommended because it takes forever and you can die very easily if you don't understand the mechanics well), or do like I did and try to stealthily kill everything.  There are beasts (caragors) which you can mount that are quick and can eat orcs to regain health, these are good at picking off orcs but only in reasonable numbers.  The environment in these missions is very important - there is hanging bait that can be shot down to lure the caragors which will immediately begin munching on orcs for you, arrows can be shot at campires and barrels strewn around the world to create massive explosions setting enemies aflame, there are nests that when shot down burst open with morgai flies that proceed to sting all in the area and you can even poison orcs' 'grog' as its called and they will drink it.

On the topic of missions, there are 3 other kinds which are related to your sword, dagger, and bow.  These missions have you kill orcs in a variety of ways.  For example, using the bow you may be tasked with disposing orcs before they reach a certain point or you will have to shoot explosive barrels to blow them up from afar.  Again, this sounds fun and it IS but it gets old fast.  It does not help that the orcs in literally every side mission or encounter in the world, save for some of the main quests, repeat the exact same lines every single time whenever you are sneaking around.  The exception to this is when you run into a captain or warchief, here they will  introduce themselves with a clever quip about how happy they are because your head will earn them a promotion, as an example.  I thought that was pretty sweet.  

A MAJOR downside to these missions however, was the fact that there is no retry feature upon failure or death.  Yes, you can do the mission over again, but you have to wait to see all the orcs get their promotions, respawn and THEN go all the way back to the mission's starting point. This sucks up a lot of time and it just is horribly unnecessary and annoying. I encountered this for the side missions only.

While we are discussing this, I should mention that there must be one or two distinct voices for the orcs; I am not even kidding, they almost all sound the same.  I will give credit where its due however and praise the orc designs as there are more than a handful here - some are tattooed, have bulky armor and just look all around menacing the way they should be, some are shielded known as defenders, some have ridiculous hair, one captain had a dead head on his shoulder for decoration, props here.   

At first your abilities in the game are limited, therefore combat feels redundant but it will feel a bit better once you level up and unlock new abilities.  Despite this the excitement here for me was shortlived.  Shadow of Mordor suffers from some awful tediousness and redundancy, even after you become an orc killing machine.  Combat in the open begins to feel like an absolute chore more than anything to the extent that you are just spamming the left mouse button and that discourages this particular playstyle completely. 

Essentially, all there is to do in the game is kill orcs, free slaves and learn to mount two beasts which was awesome I'll admit.  Also, there is of course progressing through the storyline which I sadly lost interest in.  It definitely isn't anything to write home about.  There are no interesting characters except for one and his story arc was incredibly short, but enjoyable nonetheless. Otherwise, there was little in the way of story that enticed me.  In fact, I stopped playing up until the end because one of the last missions asks you to take down 4 warchiefs; it was at this point that I really got tired of playing and decided to call it quits. I guess you can say I lost the patience to do the same thing over and over again.  In retrospect though, I did have fun for the small price I paid.

TLDR: Shadow of Mordor is overwhelmingly seen as an amazing game and in ways it is fantastic - but as a whole there is much left to be desired.  

It does a few things VERY very well such as the nemesis system, the fluid combat mechanics, gorgeous graphics, and the stellar technical performance is what we have come to expect and hope for in big budget triple A games.

 It is just that in my opinion, it was not so great especially considering that I could not stomach doing the last few story missions; I rarely ever quit a game this far into it, but Shadow of Mordor happened to be one of them.  For many out there though, especially those who love third person action games similar to Assassin's Creed or the Batman games, I can safely recommend this, you will have a good time."

One thing is i dont see why this game is open world, the world for one is boring and all looks the same, and wandering through it you will  see the same scripted events all the time ""hey look its those orcs killing that same guy in the same place again from an hour ago"" it feels like a more tight and focused stealth game has been forced into an open world, along with ubisoft style towers to climb OH JOY.

CONS:
- Disappointing and boring main story. After playing 4 hours of the story line, I have little to no interest in knowing how the story continues.
- Characters and cinematics arenot hooking me at all: Characters as well as cut scenes seem pretty ""flat"". Probably the devs wanted to present the sinister mood of Mordor. However, what they deliver in my eyes are characters that seem pretty indifferent and just dont care about the whole story. Not very motivating.
- The controls are complicated (many different buttons for the same kind of thing, as it seems to me) and seem sluggish, such that I get often stuck at things, or miss attacks. Most frustrating are the fights, here my character is often doing random things that do not seem to relate to which buttons I press.

And with that all the good news has been written. You can't set up your own controls. Your super game mouse with at least 6 more functions is reduced to a 2 clicker. To unlock (great) powers you need to do things like killing 8 Uruk to gain a flameing arrow. You have to kill them with a sword. What is the point of that? I see no relation. One is stealth the other brutal force. Most of the game you spent in Sneak mode so you have to hold that button contiuously. Why? 
This is bad as you have another dozen or so combinations you have to activate to make your puppet do things to win or survive and as such can contradict a previous order. And I have a Game Keyboard. When you are in a fight or better start a fight with a Captain or Warchief or some other bloke of any importance you get introductions. Why? I do not care who they are, I all ready know, otherwise I would not try to kill them. But what is really annoying is not only do they talk a lot for Uruks, it stops the fight. If you run and you pass a bad guy. Again the game stops and he starts talking and you can't even say anything witty back. Furthermore there is no appeal to let them finish their ranting (they could use a better dialogue writer btw) but no button to stop them. There are many many faults in this game one of them being that it does not fit in the LOTR saga at all in terms of the writings of Tolkien, LOL not even within the realms of the movies. It is a mindless action piece with a great scenery. Repetitive and unimaginative and I won't even bother with the DLC.

First I want to start with the good things about this game, and that are quite a lot. The game is very original with certain things it does. A main thing that this game stands out for is the fact that death is a game mechanic and that it has been implemented in quite an interesting way. When an enemy kills you he will get promoted and his power will increase, which makes sense since killing the ""hero"" would be an impresive feat from an uruk's prespective. Death doesn't feel like losing progression and instead even feels like the world around you is progressing.

Also the combat is mostly fun and unlocking new abilities and upgrades really make you feel stronger. Also at the end of the game you'll have learned quite a lot of attacks and you'll most likely be using nearly all of them. There's a reasonable learning curve here which feels rewarding.

So far the game might seem like a must have: An interesting game concept with fun combat in a great and well-known fantasy universe, what else do you want? Well here comes the biggest and stupidest game flaw which nearly makes me cry for its stupidity. Everytime an enemy captain gets into combat with you, gets affected by a fear or hate effect or retreats, you'll get a short cutscene ranging from 5 to 10 seconds in which the captain talks to you. These short speeches are great at the start of the game and make the captains feel special, however after a couple hours these become a bit tedious and after 10-20+ hours you're getting this negative frustrating feeling every time it happens. Keep in mind here that during combat other captains can join in and often you'll be facing 3 to 5 captains at once, which all give you 2-3 cutscenes, which all keep interrupting your combat over and over again. The inability to switch these cutscenes off is literally what drops this game down from 8.5 (on a scale from 1-10) to a 5.5 for me, as it gets so extremely frustrating the longer I play and totally ruins those combat scenes. Warchiefs are even worse, they also have an extra introduction and an extra death speech, but luckily you'll be facing mostly captains since warchiefs are basicly the leaders, and there aren't too many of those.

Also I want to get back to the combat part as there are a few small flaws there aswell. The way captains and warchiefs are all different from other captains and warchiefs is because of certain, randomised, strengths and weaknesses. One of these strengths they can have is called ""combat master"", which makes them immune to basicly any effective combat move or finishers. This combined with some other strengths can result into very long and boring fights as you simply cannot deal with your opponent effectively. You'll be spamming weaker attacks till it dies or untill you get killed as some seem to be immune to most of those aswell or even counter them. A difficult fight is not a bad thing in games and I've been able to kill any captain so far (sometimes with a couple of tries) but an effect that simply makes an enemy immune to any good attack is a bit silly in my opinion as it is a rather simple ""fix"" to make the combat more difficult. However this situation isn't game breaking and is very small compared to the terror of the cutscene spam. 

The difficulty of the game in general feels slightly undertuned. At the start it is about right but at the end you'll most likely faceroll through everything except maybe the above mentioned combat master, but in that case it's not for the right reasons. Again this is just a small flaw and isn't a gamebreaker like the cutscene spam.

Last but not least I want to talk about the DLCs that have been added to the game later on and how well I enjoyed those. The DLCs unfortionatly do not continue the main campaign but have seperate campaigns. In these campaigns you basicly start with +- all powers you have at the end of the base game, so you won't feel like you suddenly lose a lot of power. The DLCs however only have a few hours of gameplay each. The Bright Lord DLC is an interesting story and the final fight felt more challenging than the base game, which is really good thing imo. The Lord of the Hunt campaign was worth playing but had a few missions with horrible level design. An example of this: right after you unlock riding a wretched graug (which is like a huge troll-like thing) you're send to face a warchief. In order to fight the warchief you'll first have to do a small task, which is with every warchief. However this time you'll have to kill 20 archers inside the warchiefs base with the graugs spit. The problem here is that that graug is way too big for that base and you'll be faced with clunky situations while your graug basicly gets zerged down in a matter of seconds. When it dies you fail the mission and have to start over. Does the game put you right at the start of this mission you wonder? No, it does not. You'll have to walk all the way back to the begin location to start again. Also the archers outrange the spit of the graug and 20 is a little much for such clunky combat. All these things combined made for a pretty frustrating mission. Once again, this should not change your mind a lot about the game as one or a few annoying missions are not game-breaking but it's something to keep in mind. A third DLC, Trials of War, adds challenges. These challenges are basicly ""kill X amount of warchiefs and X amount of captains with X and X as side objectives withing X time. As these did imo add nothing to the game gameplay-wise I only completed one and decided not to continue. I've had enough of the game at this point and asking me to do what I did in the campaign already but this time with some time-pressure did not interest me in any way.

Overall the game has a lot of greatness but the main issue of the spam of combat cutscenes is simply unbearable and is a stupid oversight. If the makers would make it possible to turn these off the game would be a must have, now it is far from a must-have. It could have been a bright gem with a few small flaws, but now it's a broken rock with huge dents in it."

Pros:
- Story (if you like LOTR)
- World (if you like LOTR)
- Boss battles, remembering who you are and how it went - awesome!
- Plenty of things to do in the world

Cons:
- Sticky controls (mouse  / keyboard)
- Slow pop up and massive input lag of options to drain, execute, interrogate etc
- Clunky controls, no matter how I map them they become sticky
- Player sticks to objects when you don't want him to, and doesn't when you want to oposite.
- Map / World, not enough variety. Always night and dull palette

Overall, if you like the LOTR, you should give this a go, but if like me, you are not a fan of the series, the gameplay grows old fast.

1967,3,0.3399,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is great if you have above-average or superb reaction time. If you don't, then this is not the game for you. Despite being one of the most lauded titles in recent memory, and with the announcement of a sequal, I find this game to be unplayable for the following reasons:
1. The Nemesis System
One of the most praised features of this game is its dynamic ""Nemesis System"" where enemies remember their previous encounters with the player if they have killed them. This means that they have some new dialogue and other cool extra bits, but it comes at a steep price. Instead of staying at their previous level, the enemies seem to me to become even better at kicking your ass. The more you lose, the harder they become. This means that you can (and most likely) will get stuck in a never-ending cycle of defeat. Knowing that each time you lose makes them stronger adds even more of a sting to your loss. By the time you get good enough to defeat them, they have ascended to a new plane of difficulty, meaning you have to start all over again. For someone like me who cannot afford to spend hours chasing after weaknesses, this is infuriating.
2. Lack of good practice areas
You're basically shoved right into the game after a brief bit of practice. For a lot of my friends, this was good enough and they were able to move swiftly on their way. For someone like me, though, it was a bit of a shock. I was suddenly faced with a huge open world. ""Great. I'll just kill a few orcs and get used to the controls. Then, once I feel ready, I can beat the bosses."" Trouble was, the bosses were right there. I had had maybe ten-fifteen minutes, most of it spent in a cinematic, to practice my moves. Story short, they spotted me and I got dog-piled by three of them. Their patrol routes line up so that if one gets attacked, another will almost certainly come to their aid. There are cowards and fighters, sure, but the fact remains: one will attract another. This makes it impossible to concentrate completely on one without leaving your back exposed to the other. Add to this the f***ing quick time blocking, and the game becomes a gigantic pile of suck. For those of you out there who think your reaction speed is good enough, you may get some value out of it. If you're slow like me, stay away. There is nothing here for you other than frustration and sadness.

1974,3,0.5898,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Long time ago that I played this game, felt the need to write a review on it.

It's almost a 1:1 copy of Assassin's Creed, just with Orcs and some LotR elements.
The gameplay is super repetitive and boring, it's Run around a lot, kill a lot of orcs, free a bunch of slaves, kill a bunch of officers, get levelups, repeat all of that with new abilities that all result in the same thing.

I would even go as far as saying that this game has NOTHING to do with the LotR lore in any way. Gollum appears in a bunch of scenes and missions, there is some nonsense talks about Mordor, Gondor and Sauron and that's it.
Might as well just replace that stuff with other mystic names, places and objects and it would make as much sense.

Not to forget that Uruk-Hais exist in this game, which completely goes against the chronical order of the LotR story as Uruk-Hais were an invention of Saruman, not Sauron.

All in all, a very boring and repetitive game.
It's like an MMO-Game except it's singleplayer. You literally grind bosses to get better runes and levelups to be able to fight stronger bosses more easily.

The only positive thing about the game is the rather interesting rank system among the Orcs, where you can manipulate lower ranked orcs to do certain things to sabotage the Orcs ranks from within. There is a lot of stuff that went into that system, but sadly that's the only good and interesting thing about this game."

The first 2 hours you try to understand what is going on.
The second 2 hours you enjoy the game.
Then becomes a rinse of captains that you kill and get substituted without any kind of apparent reason, if not that Mordor army is huge.

The character progression is weird at best, and doesn't give any sense of accomplishment nor clarity on what you achieve.

The fighting moves are so many and with so many button variation that becomes a chore to remember.
The finishing move are interruptable and, due to the fact that enemies are by the hundreds, means you can't use them and have time to enjoy.

After only 4 hours of gameplay, from a very confusing game that was promising lots and lots to do, I'm starting narrowing on only completing story mission, as all the other stuff is endless and boring.

I don't understand how this game won all the prize and good review.

Disappinted.

Randomly jump to random enemies that surround you just because the game feels like it. Doesn't sound so bad, right? It's great because you randomly jump to enemies that can't be basic attacked and you get staggered! YAY! Oh, and do you like randomly getting stuck on walls? Me too!!!

Unfortunately the game's controls for PC (keyboard/mouse) are so cumbersome and awkward it makes this game unplayable. The quality of the game otherwise is wonderful, but without having a proper way to control your character and constantly having to battle controls, the gaming value is reduced to a big fat 0.
Even trying to customize the controls won't help you much because certain actions are all grouped together under a single control, and there's no way to split those out. In addition, I couldn't even get through the first tutorial without remapping keys to work around a massively game-breaking bug.

A real pity; I wanted to like this game as I'm a fan of the lore and books, and like what they've done with the movies. But, if I can't properly control my character, then it becomes a 4th-wall breaking experience that is neither fun nor entertaining.

It's incredibly fast paced and highly energetic but the one issue I have is the narrow 'field of view' which can obfuscate larger groups of enemies. The game soon becomes very easy to progress through, especially as more of the overpowering skills are unlocked. The simplistic movement system can be extremely cumbersome, particularly with scaling the environment, as I'd often find myself bumping into walls rather than climbing them, or descending ledges in a tardy fashion while I'm trying to quickly escape a group of enemies.

I found that I would often fail missions due to how the game would behave in a bizarre fashion. One example is where I would accidentally exit the quest area due to how the combat system magnetically locks onto enemies and throws my character's body a few dozen feet towards them, outside the quest radius. It would start to be especially dumb when the game decides to have my character land in front of an enemy, during mandatory stealth missions, rather than onto the wall or ledge near them, causing me to immediately fail the mission. There's also one mission in particular where I'm required to draw out a Warchief by killing 20 enemies in 2 minutes. For some reason, in this strange parallel universe I've suddenly entered, no one wants to confront me so I'm left searching for enemies to slaughter and have failed this mission a number of times now. I feel like I'm going insane. What I initially considered a fun game is now frustratingly tedious and soulless.

In essence, [i]Shadow of Mordor[/i] is pretty on the surface but rotten at its core.

The nemesis system is basically a way for the game to craft bosses around you playing the game. On paper that sounds AWESOME, but the ball was really dropped with this. It basically just over powers the one orc out of the group of 30 it took to kill you and eventually gets that orc to a point to which it can only be damaged one way, usually like a combat finisher or something and also making the nemesis do tons of damage and be surrounded by enemies. 

Outside of the nemesis system this game is like a bad installment in the Arkham™ franchise. The stealth is WAY too easy. Almost to the point where sometimes you will think the enemies are blind due to you walking out in broad daylight 20 feet away from them without them noticing you (I guess crouching removes you from this plane of existence?)

The developers were going for the combat system that the Arkham system devloped, and, in my opinion, they dropped the ball hard with this one. Don't get me wrong, the combat in Arkham wasn't overly difficult, but there were some some components to it that made it infinitely more fun than this. In Arkham, to master the combat, you have to get a rhythm to your button presses to punch, counter, stun, and dodge, whereas ME:SoM almost lets you go unpunished just by slapping the attack button and looking in the correct direction, save for a few special class of enemy. Also if you ever feel overwhelmed just run for 7 seconds in one directions and the enemies forget you ever existed!

Also navigating this world felt boring to me. Honestly, I felt like I was walking through the same area over and over again. Like holy shit I don't think I've ever felt this bored while playing a game.  Not only did the environments feel bland, boring, and repetitive, the parkour, while super easy to use, just did not feel satisfying. I don't know if it's the initial leap from running along the ground to running up the wall is about a 25 foot leap or that it feels almost to wonky to use efficiently, but holy poop it just felt so bad to me. They try to make it fun by giving you things to do between and on your way to missions with challenges. These challenges are ultimately a chore which devolve down to pick an herb or kill 3 of one type of enemy

Shadow of Mordor was a game that felt like it was going for an Assassin's Creed crossed with the Batman: Arkham franchise vibe. And in my honest opinion it felt like they dropped the ball in every category.

tl;dr
Combat: Easy and very forgiving. Basically slap the sword button to win. When overwhelmed run 3 seconds in the direction of your choice to escape
Stealth: Could not be easier. Crouch to go invisible is all but true
Exploration/Navigation: Boring. the onlu incentive are these hunting and ""survival"" challenges which involve killing 3 of one enemy or picking 3 herbs."

As advertised everywhere, a big part of the game is the ""Nemesis System"", where orcs that kill you become more powerful and rise in the ranks of Sauron's army. This works very well at the beginning of the game, forcing you to actually plan your encounters with your powerful enemies in order to defeat them. Unfortunately, over the course of the game you gain many new powers and abilities - but the orcs don't. At about the halfway point of the game, you've become a nearly invincible badass that can slaughter dozens of enemies in one go. This also means that there is no challenge left in the game and in turn it becomes rather dull. The boring environments and unengaging story don't help it either."

You will LOVE to HATE this game...and yet I spent the time trying to avenge my deaths cause I got so pissed off at the orc that put me down. I am a sucker for punishment.

In a nutshell, here is what happpens...

Every single time you fail...at anything at all...all your progress willl be lost. That is to say, the chiefs you killed will be replaced, die again and these chiefs will be leveled up.. You will die often and there is no getting around that. Now everytime you die your goal becomes one level higher to achieve. Add this to the fact that you can never clear an area., ""Orcs spawn endlessly and in multiple fashion"" where you will be in situations surrounded by 50+ orcs so you run away alot. And while the orcs spawn endlessly in the area, the health herds do not which is critical in the begenning.

So as you die you try to eliminate the lower ranking chiefs because your last objective is now too strong for you. Alas this is no cake walk either. The lower ranking chief will be surrounded by evermore help and if you do manage to get to him and hurt him, he runs away and you fail your task once again or worst, a low life orc kills you and he gets promoted, the chief that ran away gets promoted and your goal is now another rank higher....talk about BS.

For me the worst thing about this game was the side missions. The ""white"" ones, the easier ones to help you level up. Many are just baiting you for another death. You cant believe what you read at all. That lower level boss may be there at that location but he is often among higher ranking chiefs that t will do short work of you and the promotion cylcle continues and your task got harder yet again...

Loved the game mechanics, gameplay and environement I just dont appreaciate being continousely kicked in the nuts..then again I think I do cause I finished the game and will probably purchase the sequel.

I gotta go now, my therapy session has started.

Pros - Good graphical quality and framerate, even years after release.
        - A main character and sidekick who feel connected to the wider story of LOTR.

Cons - Stale, uninteresting Assassin's Creed-style ""Press X to win"" combat makes the fighting a drag, and there's a LOT of                        Pressing X to win.
         - ""Revolutionary"" Nemesis system provides an infinite supply of equally un-rememberable procedurally-generated Captains for the player to find, Brand and forget
         - TOO EASY. Assassin's Creed at least made the player sweat when trying to infiltrate areas. Talion can quick-sneak and stealth kill an entire base with ease, the bow is a Get Out of Jail Free card for lots of situations, and the ""Quick attack, quick attack, quick attack, same ground finish you've seen 1000 times"" combat leaves a lot to be desired.

"
2020,4,0.4297,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Pros
- Good story:

I'll admit I'm just a casual when it comes to the Lord of the Rings lore and universe but if you collect the side items and what not this game does a fantastic job of developing this universe and telling the story. You don't really need to have watched the movies to understand the premise of the plot or with the development of the world's history, however it does help.

- Great character development:

The main character you play as has a simple plot to him but the situation he is flung into and how he progresses and gets stronger makes it interesting.

- Graphics are gorgeous:

Years later this game still holds beautifully. 

Cons
- Lack of unique missions: 

Literally the same repeatable quests both main story and side quests, not much variation in any of the missions. The formula is literally rinse and repeat the whole game through and its annoying and tedious, every now and than you will do something new in the main story line quest but only so they introduce a new mechanic of the game.

- Repetitive and unchallenging gameplay/combat: 

The gameplay/combat is mediocare at best, given how its damn near impossible for you to die unless you get absolutely swarmed, which happens occasionaly given how the game makes you revisit the same orc compound/forts over and over again with no end in sight to the enemies. You could literally spend hours fighting one long continous battle alone in a fort all the while spamming attack and parry and the battle execute. But than again to be fair its a Batman/Assasin's creed hack and slash style game, so if you like the free form combat systems in games like Dark Souls you will feel pretty bored and disappointed with this lackluster combat.

- Clunky and awkward climbing mechanics: 

Climbing up walls can be very clumsy and clunky at times and makes you feel like Ezio Autistictorre. This is due to poor design in some of the walls and occasionally the controls themselves can make things awkard. To be fair though a lot of parkour games suffer from this to some extent. In this game its really a minor annoyance, but in the prime situations this annoyance can ruin a whole sneak job.

- Awkward controls/no target lock: 

The reason why I put these both together is that the issue I'm about to describe can be fixed I believe through either avenues. In the middle of a swarm of enemies it can be real damn annoying when you get your combo finisher at the end of a 5 or 8 hit combo and direct it the guy you want to one shot execute but instead you wind up wasting it on another target. This can be a minor nuisance or it could mean your death depending on the situation either way its annoying. Perhaps the worst case where this issue comes into play is when there are dropped runes on the ground and some enemies nearby. When you  try to pick up runes off the ground while there are enemies nearby the game will automatically assume you mean to grab the nearest enemy instead which can be utterly retarded. (Since grapple and pick up are the same button) Especially if all you want to do is grab the item and book the heck out of dodge.

- Lackluster sneak/assasination mechanics:

All of these orcs must be related to Helen Keller because they are all blind and deaf as a doornail. But than again given how the game constantly spawns in more orcs at random intervals and locations it would be pretty annoying if you had to perform 15 minutes of sneaking to get past one randomly generated mob that you found patroling the travel routes. But this winds up making portions where you actually are being a stealthy assasin that much less satisfying,

- Lack of unique boss fights: 

The nemesis system, that controls the spawning of elite orcs in the game, loses its charm really quick especially if you try to farm good quality rune drops from them. The nemesis system is literally just mish mashing a bunch of random buffs or debuffs for the elite orcs that spawn in game. For example you kill an orc elite that is resistant to sneak kills and range attacks, the next elite orc that spawns in could be resistant to sneak kills and resistant to fire damage. Perhaps one of the best examples I can give you of the retardness or epicness of this system, depending on how you view it is this one boss orc that spawned that literally was resistant to everything except fire damage... I literally got a 300ish hit combo on this orc, with my sword just smacking away at him only to do literally 0 damage... The issue I have with this is that this orc wasn't anything special, he was the highest level type of orc but aside from that he wasn't unique. He didn't have unique magic powers or armor or really anything at all that made him unique enough to resist all damage from 300 blade strikes, in fact he looked like any regular orc just with slightly more armor and that was it... This for me deteriorated the games immersion.

Last note: I paid $20 for this game and it was an okay purchase at this price in my opinion, I would not pay more for this game. Nor would I recommend it if you have other games you are interested in or are playing, I would say go through those first and if you literally run out of other games to play than I'd say consider this one."

2022,2,0.3894,"control, button, bad, want, time, press, right, ever, shit, click","I can see why people like this game but for me I just can't get into it. I'm no MLG pro player or anything, honestly I suck at most games, but this game is laughably easy. The game mechanics are so forgiving, stealth especially. You could literally dive off a tower, land at an Ork's feet, swing at him with your sword and miss, run behind him, hide in a bush for 5 seconds and right before you ""stealth kill"" the guy, he'd be like ""Must have been the wind or something"". Stealth is so easy and forgiving it's not even fun. All you end up doing is holding the ""stealth button"" and pressing X when an Ork gets within range not even thinking about the surroundings cause why bother. Not like anyone will catch you. 

Combat isn't much better. I could give a full explanation of how the combat works but all you need to know is that it's the Batman system but made 10 times easier. Most fights can be won by mashing X and occasionally pressing Y. Don't worry about timing though you have a good 6 second window to press that Y button to parry. Just like with stealth, combat is so easy that it fails to engage me at any level. On top of being ridiculously easy if you somehow ""die"" in this game you get a Borderlands/Max Payne 3 style second wind. To actually lose any progress in this game you must die 3 times in a row and by ""lose progress"" I mean go back 2 minutes to the last checkpoint

I've gotten about half way though the game and everytime I play it's so dull. I have to push myself through the story missions because seeing the mission counter go up is the only way I can feel any sense of accomplishment in this game."

[h1]The good[/h1]

Mordor gets a lot of things right, especially production quality. The graphics are beautiful and run flawlessly, the voice acting is top quality and there are some spectacular 'vision sequence' cutscenes. The game also feels brilliantly bolted together and playtested, I only encountered one notable bug - and that later turned out to be an Nvidia driver problem. Drivers older than 376 don't seem to be effected, so use those.

I also applaud the level design, especially in the second playable area. All areas feel well thought out, but Sea of Rhun stands out because of it's verticality. Most of the areas have multiple layers, allowing you to slip below the Orcs or drop on them from above. It's genuinely fun to play, and it brings out the best the combat system has to offer.

[h1] The bad[/h1]

Mordor also has two critical faults, which are almost gamebreaking after a couple of hours. The Nemesis system is a farce, it doesn't work as intended or contribute anything new or interesting. And the combat balance is all over the place.

Combat Balance is Mordor's most crippling weakness. It's terrible. When you're fresh out of the tutorial, you're already strong enough to take on 20-30 Orcs without taking a single hit. After a couple of hours you're maxed out and literally invulnerable against any number of normal Orcs. It doesn't really matter how many they send at you, they're so weak and you can build a combo so quickly that you can simply scythe through them. Shadow Strike Chain, and the Critical Hit system make combat a farce.

Meanwhile, an Archer Captain(who looks exactly the same as any other Archer) can reduce you to 40% health with a single arrow, but will then ignore you/stop firing completely. After that single shot you'll know exactly where they are, and many of them can be killed with a couple of Fire Arrows - an attack you can spam infinitely.

Melee Captains fight exactly like any other Orc. They have exactly the same moveset and many of them look exactly the same. You can bash swords with them if you want, but it's easier to land three hits on one of their minions and then shower them in Fire Arrows. 

Warchiefs are some of the weakest enemies I've fought. Most of them appear alone, meaning you can simply stunlock them and keep bashing until they drop. Or pepper them with Fire Arrows(always works!)

This brings me to the Nemesis system. It's a fancy name for RNG, and it doesn't work at all. At one point all four of my Warchiefs looked identical, three of them had the same Weaknesses and two had the same name. The vast majority of Captains you'll see generated are just generic Orcs with more health and damage. The system itself is an interesting idea, but it's badly realised and doesn't work well

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

I really want to like Shadow of Mordor. It does a lot of things right and only a few things wrong, but those few things absolutely cripple the game later on. Captains feel identical, fights feel identical, and there's no incentive to use Stealth when you can more quickly smash your way through the front door and kill anybody who doesn't like that. 

I'd give it a 6/10. That's not enough for me to recommend it, except for hardcore LOTR fans. Find it on sale if you can, but be prepared for a lot of repetition."
2029,3,0.6959,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","A game that's fun to play from beginning to end, but is ripe with flaws that make the experience bitter-sweet at best.

The biggest problem with the game is that every feature in it is good, but not great. Some are better than others, failing just to be perfect, while others are clunky and should be done away with completely.

The combat is a poor imitation of the Batman Arkham series, perhaps mixed in with a little bit of the Witcher. It does not flow as well as or in the same way as the other two, and countering can be unresponsive at times. The Nemesis system sounds aweomse at first but grows dull quickly when you realize how little each Uruk captain matters and when the lack of variation starts to become apparent. There are only a few different kinds of encounters you can have with captains, which involve planting your own mind-controlled ones or just murdering others. The encounters all pretty much play the same way. There's no real reason to have your own captains other than the fact that they can fight for you, which is rarely helpful. The boss battles in the game are shoehorned in at best, and have no redeming qualities.

Overall the story is generic, and the fact that it cares so little for true LotR lore makes it all the more furstrating. It seems like it's setting up for a sequel, which I'm not completely against. They just have to promise to fix everything."

Hit 'attack' over and over whilst being surround by enemies. Occasionally block the one attack an enemy orc throws at you. Pull off an 'execution' move when your combo-meter fills up.

Heck, I play it when I'm bored and feel like running around stabbing people, because that's all there is to do outside of the simplistic methods they use to intrigue you about the game. ""You can ride these monster things!"" ~You can, but after completing an objective which allows you to ride beasts, it quickly becomes boring. At first, you're like ""Oh, yes! I did it!"" But after, you don't really think about it. Nothing seems to surprise or amaze me in terms of gameplay, especially during the story missions. It feels 'expected'. The tension just isn't there.
Story:
Simply, you're out for revenge against 'the dark lord' Sauron, and to do this you go about missions and meet people along the way. There are only two maps for this game. (Technically more if you count the intro and the places you're only able to visit once) No, that's literally it.

I'd recommend this game when it goes on sale, if you feel like playing something to pass the time. It's not too frustrating, but it can be fun to toy around with the mechanics after a while. You might learn something new. Whilst the gameplay is limited, it's certainly fun to find new ways to play.

2048,3,0.4074,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Pros: Runs well.

Cons: After hearing so many good things about this game, I was nothing but disappointed. It’s an extremely consolized game. 

         Consists of an open world with your typical mini map, filled with markers that seem randomly placed just for the sake of filling it all (feels as if it was made by Ubisoft, a typical production line soulless game, also has the typical climb towers for info mechanic). 
         Combat is dumbed down, one or two clicks and the protagonist does all kinds of amazing things by himself. Several different types of movement/actions are bound to a single key, you vault, climb, run, all in one, just go forward and everything just happens by magic. 
         Control is constantly being taken from the player, whether by cut scenes or by introducing the captains, which can actually happen twice with the same one if a specific condition occurs; more captains are likely to come in while you are already battling another one, at which point you are interrupted again and the camera turns away from wherever you were facing before.

	Even though there are many “brainless” games that are enjoyable and fun, this is not one of them. Seems like a game made specifically to tick checkboxes from a list.

P.S.: A small detail regarding graphics settings, anti-aliasing and motion blur are tied in the same setting, baffling.

2056,4,0.3056,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","A fun game with fun concepts, but quite a few technical issues.

Despite disliking Lord of the Rings in general, and having a pretty boring story overall, the mechanics of this game make it a good time. The semi-organic way Sauron's army behaves is something that you'll rarely see anything resembling in any other game.

That said, there are some problems.

• The game fails to keep the mouse captured at all times, meaning that even in full screen, it's possible to click outside the game area when you have multiple monitors.
• Returning to the game from a minimized state (eg, via alt-tabbing in full-screen) sometimes doesn't return control, meaning your inputs will be ignored.
• The game seems to be somewhat framerate-based regarding input; for example, if the game starts to lag a little and you attempt to move the camera, it will swing around wildly. It also seems to lose the mouse more often when it lags.

I have died numerous times to combinations of the above.

• As expected by the minimum requirements, this game is graphically-heavy. However, I feel that it is somewhat poorly optimised - the developers decided to simply make the game run in a lower resolution if your machine is not up to scratch.
• Some encounters are incredibly frustrating, but that's partially due to the nature of the game. However, the fact that some enemies are only vulnerable to ranged attacks when you don't really have that much ranged versatility (at least, you'll run out of ammo way before you kill them and draining enemies for more takes too long in the heat of battle) feels like quite a bad decision.

If you feel like you can deal with all of this, then this is game a great pick - but these problems have become increasingly frustrating for me as I've progressed through the game.

Perhaps consider one of the console versions instead?"

2071,3,0.7483,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This game is fun, but flawed. The fighting system is smooth & makes sense, and the upgrade system is well-done. It is very serious & you are without a doubt the real deal. There is no sense of irony & no sense of humor to the plot, as it is a serious drama. That is no fun & does get stale after a little while. That being said, the game is mildly enjoyable in small doses. The main issue is that it is too difficult to succeed at, so, sadly, it has been set aside. There is a helpful craven orc character who is trying to rise to power in the orc heirarchy that is a ""fearsome pinhead,"" which I found to be sort of impressive but just a stupid choice in terms of character design. Presumably if you were going to design your own character you would be some sort of adventerous sword-wielding sorceror.

Incidentally, the Bright Lord DLC of the game where you play the ring-bearer wielding the one ring of power at its full potential is pretty fun. You take over towers & try to cover the map (sort of like being the prom king or voted most successful kid at your high school). You play as Celebrimbor & are against a character who I believe is your uncle? Anyways, that is pretty fun stuff. It is all very, very political & there is loads of intrigue and suspense as to how things are going to go. There are couples, coalitions are formed & disbanded, there's rivalries, long-running dramas, it's pretty interesting, this world.

Sorry but the Nemesis system is stupid & discourages people from trying because the punishment for failure is too severe. Makes people too cautious. I can say that now because the new game from that developer, Mad Max, is fairly similar in a lot of ways but doesn't have the nemesis system. You complete missions for money for car parts, gas & food, & you have a pad you live in with people you are affiliated with, & the gameplay is fun even if things get stale after a few hours

Storyline: I found the set up plot where I see the character's wife get captured & get a sense for why he is doing all the things he is doing to be the best part of the game, & that exposition took place right away & then I was able to do my own thing with that in mind. That was of great interest to me. The story is an open-world simulation of Middle-Earth where you complete goals for cash, XP points which you use to make changes to your character, & new gear.

In any case, I've thought about these topics quite a bit & came to the conclusion that the negatives outweighed the positives & I turned my attention to different games that were more well-thought out, specifically Max Payne 3 & Depth"

There’s a serious lack of drive behind the story and it’s entirely masked behind shallow side quests that offer very little relief from the repetitive hack and slash nature of the game. So much in fact that I found myself drawn to the story line just to get a sense of achievement within the story – unlike other games where you lose yourself in the atmosphere (here I found none). Furthermore, beyond the typical revenge plot, I did find the history behind the One Ring quite fascinating; considering I’m a Lord of the Rings (LOTR) fan. However, the that’s just another betrayal/revenge plot (possible movie). As the main story progressed towards the end, I found a slight build up towards this Black Hand character that slaughtered my beloved wife and son. That was a disappointment. The final scene was a sorely brief experience with very little satisfaction (your girlfriend probably says the same thing). If you like a historically masked hack and slash then sure, go buy the game. However, and although I got all the DLCs with this edition, I won’t pursue the additional content purely on the basis that it’s a boring game.

Combat skills and abilities doesn't really unfold well either. Abilities you unlock are only stronger and better versions of abilities you already have or applied to different enemies. So it's more of a vertical progression, rather than horizontal progression.

Even tho i know the game has a very nice story, the pc version seems to have more than enough bugs which are not okay (atleast for me) 2 years after release.

2111,3,0.4385,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Let me get this out there right off the bat:  Shadows of Mordor is a AAA+ game with an amazing open-world with combat mechanics borrowed from the Batman series (and I'll take that combat system over just about anything).  Graphics are great, surround sound works flawlessly in both Dolby and DTS 7.1, they nailed the open world feeling where you're free to roam and can choose to do the main quests at your leisure, but you never feel rushed into getting them done.  With multiple ways to approach each situation, it almost reminds me of Dishonored in how you can choose to go balls-out or stealthy, the choice is yours.  So as far as the game goes, 9.5/10, it's a must-buy.

The problem is when I see that there's a new upgrade with some potentially new DLC.  It says ""Buy ME: SoM - Upgrade to the GOTY Edition.  Awesome, I think to myself!  I can't pass up a good DLC bundle!  Then I read the 5.5 super light grey scale font in fine print that reads [i][b][h1]""Please note: The Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor - GOTY Edition Upgrade and the previously available Season Pass are the same product.""[/h1][/b][/i].

That's odd, I think to myself.  I recall already owning BOTH the stand-alone Shadow of Mordor as well as the GOTY Edition Upgrade.  And you greedy *expletives* are trying to pull a fast one on your customers by not only making it confusing as to what exactly is included in the DLC package, but just for good measure, you might as well change the font size and color so that you need an electron microscope to find out if yuo're being screwed by what up until this point I had complete faith in.

So to reiterate.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game, it gets a 9/10 for me, but this new trend of making your customer spend an hour researching whether or not he's double-paying for some DLC he already owns so that you can potentially get a chance at making a quick extra buck is going to persuade me to find ""alterior methods"" of acquiring your game and leaving you with a negative review.  If you can make things right and make this customer proud to be an owner of Monolith Productions products, then I'll be glad to change my review and purchase your next game in the future.  All you're missing is some good PR and some solid transparency.

Other than that, keep up the fantastic work and please don't make me read the fine print when your next DLC comes out because I will most certainly be purchasing it!"

The combat is pretty solid, and that is a good thing, since that is basically all this game is. You can't walk 10 ft without running into a group of Orcs, and they re-spawn so soon after you kill them that you will be fighting constantly. The story is OK, but its presentation isn't anything special. You will move it forward in a series of 20 missions that are pretty forgettable alongside allies you won't care about.

The nemesis system is a cool idea, however I felt that it didn't live up to its potential. The various Orc leaders you fight all have different strengths and weaknesses, but appear frequently enough that they start to feel pretty commonplace and not that unique at all. I think it could have benefitted from making them a little more scarce and difficult, to make it feel like an achievement when you actually kill one.

But while this is game is fucking gorgeous, the gameplay sucks balls, sorry blind fans boy's it's the truth, games like assassin's creed after the first hour of parkour and mindlessly doing the same grab/fetch/kill quests over and over again for 20+hours is straight up boring.

Now I will give the lore in this game an A+ and it was entertaining to see how the blacksmith shaped the 2nd age, but that is where this game stop, period.

I love Batman, but after the 3rd goddamn batman game that is virtually identical to the first, I have to put a stop to it, and I would actually find the batman games boring if I didn't enjoy the rest of the game.  

I have no idea how I completed more than 10 hours of this game, I was so utterly bored, but I really wanted to finish it.

Graphics A+
Gameplay D-, only positive was the branding system and it's uses, otherwise this would be worse than an F
Sound, don't really care.
Lore A+

overall despite being graphically and lore positive the gameplay outshadows any kind of positive on this game, I would not recommend this game to anyone for any price, period.  

From your first mission/quest to your last you do the same thing the whole time.  They copied batman's fighting mechanics, which I've never been a fan of anyway, and assassin's creeds' parkour and boring questing/mission system.

I don't care how much you love LOTR, watch all the vids of the cutscenes online if you like the lore, leave the game alone.

We need to start sending the message to gaming companies you can't keep copy/pasting games over and over again and get paid to do it, strap a DnD, warhammer, Starwars, batman, LOTR tag on it and watch the money flow in, it's disgusting.  And kids under 30, you've grown up with these shitty games and I apologize, but there is better out there, you've just never played them yet.  Graphics don't make a game.  Story, interaction, gameplay mechanics, make a game.

sorry for the rant this shit is just pissing me off.

This game is suppose to be an RPG, nothing in this game engages me to anything including the spirit or the enemies, and you're an overpowered toon who can literally kill 100 orcs while surrounded with little to no problems and no fear of death or loss.  Nothing in this game other than the lore is engaging and the lore has zero effect on the gameplay or the progression of the main quest line. 

What worries me more than anything is the overwhelming postive reviews this game has received and that means that the gaming companies and you kids will continue to allow these games to be made and believe they are epic games.   You are allowing the death of innovation by allowing games like this to continue."

Ok i just finish the game on a rush and i'm very disapoint, because the story, the basic tecnics, the gameplay, at the start are ok, but on the game the more you advance the more crazy gets the game.
I'm gonna write some ideas of the game, not good, not bad, your choise to decide what :)
-The music fits in the story and in the gameplay.
-The story is a continue to a story already created, the world of The Lord of the Ring
-It has many elements of games like Assassins Creed or Batman, the Arkham saga (Like the parkour, the detective vision, the simplicity of the attacks..)
-All the scenarios are carefully elaborated, so the bushes are put in that position because of something.
-Any orc, just fot been an orc can be a general (even if the didnt fight in his life)
-The story, a continue to LOTR, remember in the same way to games like Shadow of the Colossus
-The situations in which you have to carry anything makes the action and the nuanced plot very very VERY SLOW.
-At the start, dont matter the orcs you kill in the hierarchy, there's always gonna be more and more.
-Elements like rocks (which are use to run with an hability) are sometime best laid, so makes the experience on that time like artificial
-When you get killed many times, the orcs remember you and make jokes on you (For example, laughing because you are so bad that with only one life is not enough)
-The change of scenario is weird, because it look to change everything, but the style of the structures remains (like towers or fortress/ Now imagine a medieval castle in a pink land, weird itsnt it?? )
-The most important boss you have, the one you've been hunting for all the game, is meaningless (Dont want to ruin any experience, so dont gonna detail anything) And the next thing that happens is even more meaningless

For a fast end, the game start ok, good and simple gameplay, very good story to lean on, a normal vissuals for the time, but like magic they manage to destroy a potencial 10 game to left pieces ok 5 at most. Not bad is you have nothing to do"
2123,3,0.6314,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well",A repetitive and simple hack and slash game in Middle Earth. I bought it because it had a positive feedback but I should have done some research first. It's a bad copy of the first Assassins Creed games where you do the same thing over and over again.
2124,3,0.3394,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Pros :
Not bad, but don't misunderstood, it's a pur action game, like Assassin Creeds. Don't think you will play a role game like Skyrim, here you will have to fight, fight, and fight. But it's well rendered, very smooth, and well made, so like an action game, it rocks. You got powers trees, swordman, thief and bowman play style, and the ambiance is the dark mordor of lord of the ring, including lore story parts, golum, orcs, elves, and sauron. 

Cons :
Just it's quite repetitive though, when you're dead, you will respawn at towers, and all enemies are back again. Even if you turn around for a while, enemies are back too, as you are in an undead area at start.  The orcs captain system is very strange, it doesn't add anything to the game : when you kill a boss, or an orc slay you, there's like an orcs boss tree map that is updated, but who care of orcs boss tree map ? Sometimes, the missions are really boring (like find some rare herbs in a small area). And it's a mess to play with keyboard, this game is really designed for consoles. For linux users, you will have to deal with a big bug of bodies not rendered : you should add ""__GL_ShaderPortabilityWarnings=0 %command%"" to the launch options if you got nvidia proprietor driver, as explain in a discussion topic.  

So not a bad game, maybe to much repetitive, but around 20 bucks it worth it, as it's nice game though. I recommand it as an action game in a Lord of the ring univers, but don't recommand it if you wanna play a role game (unfortunatly there's no ""mixte"" recommendation). At full price, I don't recommand it though, as it's way to much repetitive. It's not a game you will replay when finished. So the recommend balance is going to No."

2143,3,0.4326,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This is definitely one of the most annoying games I've played in recent years. Shadow of Mordor is derivative trash from head to toe, more so than most non-original IP games in the industry, and almost every aspect of this game feels like it wants to be in or belongs to a different game.
The gameplay is essentially a cross between Arkham series combat and Assassin's Creed movement/stealth (""stealth""), and with a bit of that awful awful MGR auto-platforming drivel, but none of it is executed as well as in the games where those mechanics originate from. Shadow of Mordor essentially takes the worst parts of Arkham and AssCreed and blended them together into a cliche spectacle action game, and threw it onto an open world map for good measure, because lord knows we don't have enough of THOSE in modern video games (I am being completely sarcastic. If a game publisher ever reads this, please stop making open world games. Thanks.)
Like in most modern open world games, the fact that it's open world adds very little to the actual gameplay, and serves little purpose other than to add unnecessary travel time between fights and about a million collectibles strewn all over the place like a pane of glass that fell off a building. The collectibles serve to give you experience points to spend one of the many upgrade trees which unlock mostly core mechanics that should be available from the start, like tapping ""Q"" to throw batarangs (daggers) like in the Batman games, or (I'm not even joking) causing explosive barrels to explode when you shoot them. The vague RPG mechanics most likely exist so that the game can hop onto the modern gaming RPG mechanic bandwagon and so that players can mindlessly grind collectibles around the map so that they can have a break from the equally mindless two-button combat mechanics that this game has to offer. Look at me mom and dad, I have an experience bar with upgrades too!
The upgrade system likely exists in order for collectibles that give the XP for it can exist, which in turn exist because of the fact that the game is open world instead of level based and linear like most games of this type. This game could have been streamlined by throwing the open world concept into the trash where it belongs, and I guarantee you that the game would have lost nothing of import, and would probably have been better for it.
Combat in this game is simplistic, like how it is in the Arkham games, but more forgiving and with less emphasis on being skillful and having very long combo chains. Instead, a lot of fights boil down into a war of attrition between you and the mass of enemies that will almost surely be outnumbering you and will eventually overwhelm you through sheer numbers. Individual enemies pose pretty much no threat to you, and neither do groups of them unless they have ranged attacks, which can hit you with no warning, their projectiles seemingly passing through their allies as if they were thin air, breaking your combos and hit-stunning you, and also doing a huge amount of damage.
Moving in combat is a nightmare a lot of the time. The animations and geography detection are very janky, and it's very easy to grab onto ledges and climb walls that you had no intention to. Sprinting and climbing on walls are bound to the same key, like in MGR, essentially turning your character into a spastic wall spider. The frequent accidents in movement have the potential to add a lot of frustration to fights, as your character will just as easily interpret an order to jump over an enemy as an order to uselessly cling onto a nearby stone, and vice-versa.
Graphically it looks nice, but what doesn't these days? The soundtrack is alright, but given the source material, they could have done a lot better, just like with almost every other part of this game.
Story doesn't leave much to speak about. Protagonist's family gets killed by the forces of Sauron, now it's his job to brood and enact revenge on the Dark Lord's forces. Whatever.
Overall, I think you'd be a lot better off playing one of the Batman: Arkham games, or even one of the Assassin's Creed titles. This game does not innovate or invent anything new, nor does it improve on anything that existed before it. Also, it takes up 44 gigabytes of hard drive space, but for some reason it requires 90GB to install it. Absolutely inexcusable."

2148,4,0.5647,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Personally, this game just failed with me. Combat is a lot of fun. The movies and voice acting are PHENOMENAL. The story is pretty cool so far and yet I DID NOT and DO NOT enjoy playing this game. Why you might ask? Well, it's really quite simple: Sauron's army is led by several Uruk captains whom you are tasked to identify, hunt, defeat in combat, interrogate, and then kill. Awesome! No. Unfortunately, the 20 some odd captains are walking around ALL over the place and you can easily bump into an unidentified captain, and his cohorts...did I mention they like to travel in packs?...and then should they defeat you, they level and become more powerful. Should you happen to kill them well...there goes whatever mission(s) was/were associated with said Uruk Captain! Yay! <---Dripping with sarcasm

And for those of us who DESPISE to have ANYTHING in the story change or be taken from us, if you are killed by a random Uruk, whom may have just shown up out of nowhere, seen the commotion, nicked you in the ankle and killed you, it now gains ""power"", is promoted to Captain status and (more often than not) kills an unidentified captain and usurps their place, forever robbing you the opportunity to see whom the original captain was! And yes, if you die often, this will happen again, and again, and again, and well you get the picture.

If you happen to like some semblance of linearity in your game, DO NOT bother playing this game, and what a shame it is, for the graphics, VOICE ACTING, and story seem so awesome. I just cannot stomach it anymore. End rant."

People can hail the gameplay all they like but honestly it feels very empty considering it all boils down to a very basic type of Batman style hits sprinkled with easy to use finishers that get stale quickly. 

The game gives you virtually no reason at all to engage it on any level except as a sandbox to beat up orcs in. At the very start, the main character's family is murdered before his eyes. Instead of developing any kind of emotion for either the player or the character the game simply jumps straight into: ""ok now you're a supernatural badass from random phenom! Go kick ass and chew bubblegum cause you Cant. Ever. Really. Die.""

There is no real incentive to progress the story, there is no tactile incentive to explore the world, the only substantive reason to wander the sandbox you are dropped into is to find more orc captains to slaughter through a repeating series of special moves that make you virtually unstoppable when used smartly.

I admit I bought the game late, and I bought it on an extreme sale, but I cannot help but wonder after only 3 hours of playtime, how this game ever managed to draw a ""game of the year"" title to itself with such a sterile atmosphere and numbingly repetitive gameplay mechanics."

That's the first half an hour of the game, and you get a false impression that this is going to be amazing. Once you discover leveling up and your new abilities you almost instantly become a god. Stronghold? Who cares. You can slaughter wave after wave of enemies, no captain can stop you, nothing can stop you. Monotonous and tedious slaughter in a bland landscape.

Since it was the highlight I expected it to have a fairly important role in the story. I was wrong. It really comes into play at one point, when you fight your ""nemisis"" or the orc boss you fought the most. I was atonished at how it poorly picked a weaker boss that was only my nemisis because he didn't die for three fights when I defeated him, for seemingly no reason. The other problem with it, is that all the bosses are extremely easy to beat. The only time you will struggle with an orc-boss is if they have a frusterating comobation of class and perks. It gets to be so repeatitive and boring to fight bosses, especially when there is almost no story line interaction with most of them. So you have to interact with the cut-outs and pretend like there is any history because you are likely to kill them in the first or second interaction. Even worse is that the variety in orc bosses designs doesn't kick in until after you beat the easy, boring, and short story. The only reason to really do them is to unlock abilites. At one point you will unlock a ""brand ability"" which takes control of orcs. Cool, right? Yeah, but again the game uses it pretty poorly and after the first time of making a boss attack another, the coolness runs out. There is no point to branding the random orcs, they only randomly appear pre-branded if bosses are branded. I feel no motivation to play the dlc, as it is equally awful and uncreative as the main game. If you enjoy mindlessly fighting hordes of orcs with just the mouse, having no difficultly at all, and doing it the same way every single time, then you may like this game. But I cannot recommend it to you, even if you're the previously mentioned person, unless it's at an extremely lowered price."

After this remark I could not tolerate it and had to hit a quick ALT F4 as I felt that the comment was very derogatory and I felt very upset afterwards.

In the second part of the game war chiefs have captains as bodyguards, which means you have to watch up to 5 introductions scenes in one fight. Fighting 4 captains and a warchief at the same time is also not fun. 

Particularly when all of them are immune to stealth. And some of them deal considerably more damage than normal Uruks (they kill you in one to two hits) and are immune to ranged attacks. Sprinkle a berserker captain with combat mastery into the mix and you have a very annoying group to defeat. So at the end of that fight you will have seen several of the introductions scenes a few dozen times probably. 

And since it's a main quest you have to fight them to finish the game.

2172,3,0.4616,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Where to start
1. Graphics
a. Overall i'd say that the graphics can be considered ""pretty"" when run on higher end(honestly probably about stock i5 and gtx 970+ ish~~) pc's that can handle a high frame rate well.  There is no ""OH MY DOG""(twitch refrence) moment of this is amazing. Atleast for me.  The worlds color scheme and the textures of the area you run in aren't really meant to be noticed and can show it when you take your time creeping around in bushes like I chose to do for a bit.
b. I'd definately say that theres no real benefit to even trying to play the game on max quality because you don't get any more out of the game for doing so.
2. Story
a. It's there for sure buried under repetative hack and slash and bash and run around the same area 60 times game play style.  It's definately appealing but even for someone who can't very well sit and read you'd probably have a more enjoyable time listening to an audio book of the story than playing the game for it because of all the undesirable filler content between.
b. I didn't personally feel compelled to even complete the story sided missions because of how little reward they had, it was frankly more fun listening to the short stories from the various artifacts you can find across the map.
3.Combat/Movement
a. Combat definately seems ""smooth"" for group fighting and one on one but not so much one on one during a group fight.  Great for just blowing off Steam and running into an enemy base and just smashing everythings face in for about 15 minutes straight and just watching the bodies pile up.
b. It can get incredibly boring very fast if you don't explore the different options between stealth/ranged/full frontal assault.
c. you can find yourself climbing the wrong wall or leaping off a ledge without purpose from time to time but overall i'd give it a B+ since you can usually navigate while running fairly well and riding on the OVERGROWN KITTIES is great.
4. ETC
a. They definately give you a few other little gathering/hunt for treasure type activites to do which can help hide some of the lesser quality gameplay that is Shadows of Mordor, which I basically needed to even play the game as long as I did.

5. Overall
I unless you get this game and dlc for about 70-80%+ discount I wouldn't advise purchase.  You more likely than not will not get your $$$'s worth out of the game because of how fast it gets boring and repetative. Trust me I know and like boring and repetative I've got about 2 full years of logged in time on only 1 of my Runescape accounts <.< ..."

A functional, but uninspired blend of Assassin's Creed and Arkham City, with a weak LotR theme, limited mostly to name dropping, and even weaker graphics.  Expect to die, a lot, until endgame, when you can take on every orc in the world at once.  

+ Combat mounts
+ I got the Season Pass somehow?
+ Hunting & Gatherting mini quests

+- Fast travel, rather spread out
+- Arkham Combat, but Arkham City did it better
+- Assassins Creed free running, but ACB did it better
+- Weapon runes add minor stat customization, can buy more OP ones in DLC
+- Varying performance on a 970, sometimes 90+ FPS, other times sub30.  This seems to be due to ultra Shadows.
+- Branding.  Mind control enemies.  The best feature in SoM, but they save unlocking it until halfway through the story.  On top of that, its not unlocked for any meaningful reason, just ""OK, lets brand now!""
+- Sauron's Army.  Enemy rival system, over hyped.  Hardly has an effect, especially later in the game, when you're unlikely to die and/or brand them all.  The way it only updates when you die isn't enjoyable either.  Its also required for story progress, which makes it feel even less like a natural and dynamic part of the world.  The way orcs visually upgrade, and remember you if you and/or they die (but somehow survive) is interesting, and it gives you the option to take out captains before going for the warchief to make things easier.  Could be a much better system if integrated better, instead of as a punishment for death.  

- No multiplayer/coop
- Can't replay missions
- Clunky camera angles

- The only character customization is pay2dlc skins
- Poorly written story, with practically no relation to LotR
- Combat lacks the quickfire gadget variety of Arkham City

- Flurry finisher animation has no iframes until you upgrade it
- Never visit any memorable, recognizable, or interesting locations
- Expect to die, a lot, as an integrated part of the game and progression
- Being low on health has an annoying mute + heartbeat effect on sound
- Open world is mostly empty nature space, with non-stop enemies to kill
- Upgrades are locked behind multiple gates and split between multiple currencies
- You play as not-Aragorn.  This replacement is unlikeable, selfish, and poorly written

I will just list all the things which suck in this game.  I will get a lot of fanboi hate, but who really cares about 10 year olds?

Note: played with controller on PC because this is a PURE CONSOLE PORT, which means good luck playing with moise and keyboard.

1) Camera FOV sucks.
Camera always finds a way to screw you.  When in a major fight, it will find a way put all the action behind a wall or another obstacle.

2) Camera sucks part deux
When enemy super sayan bad buy shows up (more on those tards later), the camera switches to him as he makes a speech (basically says hello).  The camera angle then STAYS at this angle and does not come back to its original position.

This is extremely bad (or can be) because it usually is an awkward position, i.e. he shows up behind you and now camera is showing your front side as you're trying to move/run forward

3) Camera sucks trois
You move the right stick to move the camera.

No, am not joking.  The camera is guided by the player.  It sometimes (but not always!) will sort itself out and do a semi-chase camera.  But usually you're struggling to move the right stick to focus the camera as it shifts you behind a giant wall and you're getting overrun by 50 orcs.


HOLY CRAP MORE CAMERA SUCKS:
The camera is usually pointg RIGHT. OVER. SHOULDER.
So the view you get as a player is VERY limited.This gets bad in big furball fights, but is also bad when you're tying to see the lay of the land.

To look up, move your stick up to see what you can climb and what's up there.  Great, now you see  in your 20 DEGREE vision sphere directly up.


4) Nemesis system is the dumbest boss mechanic in the history of gaming.

This game has many bosses.  These bosses level up by killing you - or being nearby when you're killed by 50 orks.  Now, lets say that you're having trouble killing a particular type of boss - one who does ranged combat.

You die, and he levels up.  That means that he becomes more powerful by defeating you.  Since you're having issues killing him, you're gonna have an even harder time now.

He kills you again, and he becomes super powerful.  Now you dun goofed - you have a super sayan immortal ranged badguy who takes off 1/3 of your health with his one shot.

And it's not like you can get to him, as he is always surrounded by 50 orks.

Now, imagine that there there are many more ranged bosses...

5) Nemesis system is horribad part dwa

You learn the game, you kill off a boss, and are happy.  Then..... you see that, haha, you didn't kill him - he is somehow alive and comes back and he even says that you killed/defeated me but whateva.  What the.... ?

6) Carpal tunnel 100% guarantee
This is a button masher.  You will hit ""X"" (attack) roughly 400 times in an hour of playtime.  This is alongside other buttons, like holding ""A"" to parkour everywhere (this is assass cream, LOTR edition).  I thought Legolas in LOTR movies movement was inhuman and a bit over the top - our protagonist climbs 200 metre towers faster than he runs on level ground!

7) Boredom
You will kill orks.  And kill them some more.  And then kill them some more.  You will fight super sayan bad guys. Captains. Die and/or kill them.  And do it some more.

Actually, that is all you do in this game - you run around and you kill orks.  

THAT'S IT.

8) Game prompts - it's hilarious that the game pops up hints right over your avatar's head.  Hints is too strong a word - there are three hints.  Press ""Y"" NOW!!!!11 to dodge an enemy attack, Press ""A"" !!!!!111 to climb (remember, camera angle dependent - you might wish to climb but uh oh, camera is at a wrong angle....) and ""Press ""A"" to dodge!!!11"".

Those are your hints.  Total brainless button masher.

9) Console port with all that implies

Very jerky controls.  When you run, you can get stuck behind a small rock and not jump over it, camera angle dependent.  You can be standing right over an enemy and try to execute an jump onto your back and stabby-stabby attack - except you don't get the prompt to do so.

All the camera, FOV, jerky movement - this is part and parcel of the console market for kids' games, and that is what you get.


Who might like this game:
1) Someone who has very strong hands and fingers, perhaps from watching pr0n in a physically active way, may have hands and fingers strong enough to handle this

2) Someone amused by killing 1,000,000,000 orks in the same 3 ways over and over and over...... Because that is the gaem, that is all that you do, kill same orks in same 3 ways forever.

So, basically a perfect game for someone like radbrad, the youtuber sensation.

The combat takes your expectations of it being a braindead button masher, and exceeds them by lightyears.. you will be mashing that button a very great deal and most likely fall asleep in the process, awaking to a pile of dead orcs (or uruks?) around you.

You'd be better off playing Assassin's Creed or Batman Arkham games, which this one tried and failed to mimic. Their controls and handling in free movement/combat are far superior. Though the combat systems aren't top tier in those games, both are still far better than this piece of garbage.

STORY
Lets start off with the simple stuff, the storyline. Not only is it very short, it is very overdone, your family is killed, and you seek vengence, you gather an army, you make close allies, you go after boss. Just wish that a new twist could have been put onto this, or an original story could have been made. Not to mention, that once again, we are seeing more bland, unrelatable characters, alongisde our already bland, and unrelatable playable character of Talion. So sad to see this, honestly, I though that is anything was done right, it would've been the story. The Lord of The Rings series is so uniquely creative, and unfortunately, if your only knowledge of Lord of The Rings is playing this game, it could be a big turn off to potential readers/fans.

COMBATT
Again, with all of Warner Bros. games, it is the exact same form of combat, pushing two or three buttons. Why do they do this? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owpd8YiBFcE
This is just one example, but, Shadow of Mordor is no different. There is a huge gap between what is really going on on-screen, and what the player is doing. Talion may be flipping around, executing Uruks, but the player is only pushing a few buttons. The cool things you see on screen wear off after a while and the game becomes boring again. I really hope this doesn't catch on any more than it already has, and why it has become acceptable to have to do so little in games anymore really amazes me. The ""stealth"" aspect of this game is an absolute joke as well.

PARKOUR/CLIMBING SYSTEM:
Very unpolished, making it feel like a discounted Assassin's Creed knock-off, I wish they would have dedicated just a little more time to it, because otherwise it would have been decent. Often times Talion will not go where you tell him to go, or it will take him 2-3 seconds to even move from the position.
Irritating when you are attempting not to be seen, and you unintentionally make him jump off a roof thus making him seen by all the Uruks in the near area.

SCENERY/LANDSCAPE/WILDLIFE:
Very beautiful game to look at honestly, the colors are so vivid, and the landscapes are awesome and pretty vast. The only gripe I have with the games scenery/graphics is that again, like all developers, they cater to console users, and all the cutscenes are pre-rendered. I really despise that, but I also understand that the developers are in the business to make money, not just to please fans, but this is going off topic. 
The Caragors, and Graugs and pretty cool to ride and kill, I like that feature, and for the most part, the creatures and wildlife are pretty lore-friendly. Except for the Ghuls, they were added for no real reason and server no actual purpose to the story, another useless feature that actually takes away from the story, and may confuse potential fans. That and not all of Mordor is a complete wasteland like this game may lead you to believe, but that really isn't a big deal.

NEMESIS SYSTEM/OTHER GIMMICKS:
The biggest selling point for this game is the Nemesis system. I cannot dispute the fact that this feature is pretty cool at first, but later on, you can tell it's really just a cheap gimmick. It gets old fast, and very tedious. Having to find and ""interrogate"" Uruks for information about higher-ups is very tedious, and repetitive, but doing this isn't necessary, therefore, another gimmick.
The only real gimmick I enjoyed a lot is being able to possess enemies and make them fight for you. 

OVERALL RATING/OTHER COMPLAINTS/OTHER THINGS I ENJOY:
What I do like about this game, which may seem contradictory, is the fact that you do have a choice of ""stealth"" or going in head on and taking out enemies. 
TONS of collectables, if you still want to take a shot at this game, you can definitely invest at least 100 hours into it if you want.

What I do not like about this game, which I know will be controversial, but I personally do not see a need for it, especially in this game, is the inclusion of a mini-map. This game is supposed to be an open world, adventure RPG. With the inclusion of the mini-map, you are not able to take in all of the beauty this game has to offer, it would have been really cool if you would've ran through Mordor, finding pieces of the map after killing/searching Uruk encampments or other places. Would have made it feel a lot more survivorish and cool in my opinion.
I really wish that they would just take out all mini-maps from games, I know this is the new norm, but I truly dislike them.

I truly wish I could reccommend this game, but I cannot say that I enjoyed it very much. It will confuse newcomers to LOTR series, the combat is boring, and repetitive, the story, is boring, and repetitive... The games gimmicks are just that, cheap gimmicks."

Your character can break someone's arm, slash their throat, and toss them asided like a ragdoll at the press of a button.

2200,2,0.3753,"control, button, bad, want, time, press, right, ever, shit, click","This game suffers from the worst case of consolitis i have ever seen. If you play with mouse and keyboard forget this game.
First off, the absolutely horrible camera controls with mouse. I mean this is bad. We're talking negative mouse accel of epic proportions here.

But the keyboard controls take the prize.
There's about 2.5 million different combinations of keys to press for different actions and none of them makes sense. For example, to interrogate someone you don't press a dedicated context-sensitive key.
No, you press (wait for randomly generated keystroke assignment..) Left Ctrl + Space.

I'm not even joking. Thats what you press to interrogate someone.
Pick something up? E or F, or even left mouse? No. Left Ctrl.
Sure you can probably bind that action to something else, but expect to spend quite some time in the menus fiddling with the endless amount of combos for everything. But you would be forgetting the world shattering question here though: Why on earth would someone who took part of the development of this game, decide that Left Ctrl would be the default choice for PC players? It's scary to think about, and i've seen all the SAW movies without even flinching.

As for gameplay, i was bored after 90 minutes of clickspamming enemies doing the same actions over and over. There's exactly zero joy to be had from any accomplishment in this game.
I mean i can stand smartphones and pokemon chasers and whatnot. This, i cant.

I bought it for 7.99€ during the sale. I wouldnt play it if they paid me. Unless it was in fried chicken wings.

2201,3,0.6005,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Disclaimer: Mixed review. Didn't feel like it deserved a Recommendation.
Have actually read the books. Seen all the films. Im passionate about this, so criticism isn't done to ""hate on"" the game. I just want to see something like this but better done.

Positives
-Beautiful Setting 
-Beautiful graphics
-World building is great through the collecteable artefacts which help flesh out Mordor as a once pure land.
-Planning assassinations. The game is perfect in terms of a sandbox. You have various ways to approach objectives (through climbing up to the tops of ruins or fighting through hordes of enemies with the combat system)

Neutrals / Negatives. 
(Most of these are borderline negative)
-""Arkham"" style combat. Some may enjoy this, but others will be sick of it. Having only ever had experience with it in this game, I hate it. Its love or hate really. I personally found it repetetive, dull and unengaging

-""Nemesis"" system. As a selling point for the game, its really rather poorly done. The first few Uruk Hai who kill you will be memoreable. They'll make thay introductory experience great. The problem is the system loses its charm for various reasons...
1) A kill ""Nemesis"" can come back from the dead. This completley ruins the experience as it takes away that satisfaction of having killed that Nemesis. It makes them seem like a regular enemy.
2) Being constantly killed by one Nemesis can make him so strong that he literally becomes unkilleable. Throwing spears that kill you in 1 hit AND the enemy is invulnerable to being stealth killed OR an arrow to the head? The system needs some kind of limiter to make a nemesis seem challenging, but not the Lord of bloody Mordor.

-The map areas are split. The game has 2 separate open world areas. It would have been better to have 1 large one ; no loading times between zones, better game flow and itd make the Nemesi seem more... ""Alive"". Both map zones have different Nemesi ; the whole point of the system is to make enemies memoreable, yet all this does is make you forget them.

-Poor story. Generic ""avenge your family"" story. So much more could have been done based on the source material at hand.

-Bland main character. Why should I care about Talion? He isnt developed in any way. One could argue that this is to allow us to ""impose ourselves onto him"". Rubbish. If so, make him voiceless and fix the story. We're apparently meant to care about his family having been murdered.

-Repetetive. Some may like this. I certainly don't. The ""challenges"" arent challenging (dull if anything). The combat is samey, the Nemesis system loses value after a while.

-Huge download. It was at 42.1 GIGABYTES. Why? Prerendered cutscenes are included, inflating the file size. Why not just have in game ones? The graphics are already fantastic.

-Doesn't stay true to lore. Although the setting does stay true to the lore (not ALL of Mordor is a blasted hellscape), the insertion of some creatures (namely Ghuls) is not lore friendly.

Final Comments
It feels like an Assassins Creed game set in Arda. Thats probably the best way to sum it up honestly. I can't recommend a dull, repetetive game that has a ""Novelty"" system that wears thin after a while. Save your money for something of better quality.

EDIT 1: Clarity issues."

You will struggle throughout the game to do anything, always running looking for 'herbs' to heal or elven arrows to fill your quiver.    

At 3rd tieryou can have more than 8 arrows, but it will cost an ability point, arrows are basically worthless most of the time anyway,  until you can unlock as much as humanly possible.  You don't stand a chance.  You're going to have to work your ass off for everything in this game and repeat the same CRAP over and over again.   

 I've tried to finish this game, I've killed quite a few bosses,  I've even killed off two warchiefs  but the thing is that when you do try to take out a boss,  which is weaker than a warchief and it's not hard to do,  even if you kill off every orc in his initial entourage, his bodyguards or his warband, they keep on respawning,  just when you're about to kill the boss you find yourself surrounded with more orcs to kill and until you kill them they keep on picking at your health while you attempt to dispatch the boss.  It gets pretty damn old real quick and in fact I'm sick of it again.  

 I usually play this game for a few days, uninstall it, reinstall it a year later, try it again because I forgot all of that and when I figure it out again after killing a couple bosses I get sick of it and I recall the pattern.  

You are WAY better off playing ASSASSINS CREED,  any of them, because this game is trash.   It has some cool elements but Warner Brothers didn't know how to capitalize on those and the game is basically a lazy piece of you know what. 

A few good elements, but the game as a whole is garbage.  It's an arcade game.   I got the entire thing,  all the DLC years ago for 10 bucks because this game sucks and no one wants it anymore because people have  more than likely figured it out and are probably playing Assassin's Creed instead, which this game borrows a lot from but doesn't do it nearly as well, not even close."

I fell off a cliff because of the wonky controls, had to fight 8 or so orcs and a boss. The boss would take no damage, after fighting him for a bit I found out that if you suck out his soul with your wraith powers he takes damage, so the fight was just me hitting the B button over and over (super fun /s).

Only managed to play this for 5 hours before i was fully bored of it (I did eventually finished the game but it did not change my mind about the combat)...Wasted money unforutnately. Do not do the same mistake if you expect the combat system to be of equal quality to the first 2 arkham games (which the combat system here is a copy of).The combat is largely unresponcive there are awfully balanced encounter with endless respawns and endelss spawn of new bosses with no real consistancy of why.

The enemies respawn far too quick to the point of making gameplay pointless. There's no 'I'll systematically clear this stronghold out, then hit the objective'. By the time you've got halfway through the enemies, the first ones are respawning again. There's no sense of progress, and attacking non-boss enemies feels like a waste of time. The only real option is just to run straight up to your main target and have a fight with him.

The 'nemesis' system is pretty much non-existant as well (anyone you fight gets killed, so...no survivors to be your nemesis...') and the 'work your way through Saurons Army' feature is worthless as captains and generals you kill just get replaced over time with generic Orcs. 

This is essentially Assassin's Creed, but set in LOTR universe, and minus the interesting story and the varied gameplay. I'm really not sure why people are calling it the best game they've ever played, I found it too boring to continue past the first map. Each to their own though.

Around minute 30 is when you realize that you've been doing the same thing since you began. The difficulty ranges from instantly killing warchiefs to having them be nearly immortal. The controls are usually pretty smooth. climbing sometimes takes you places you don't want to go and targeting specific orcs for combat finishers doesn't always work out.

After a lengthy, repetitious slog through the game, you've made it to the next (and final) zone. Yes, there are only 2 areas to explore. In this zone you'll find nothing has changed.

Now you have the ability to brand your foes, converting them into allies! Too bad the xp gain from it is negligible, but on the bright side, you are now almost literally untouchable.

This game can give you a challenge which i like, but it can be very overwhelming and frustrating when you have 20 urks around you and 5 warcheifs, The combat was instresting and fun for atleast 2 hours but after awhile it can get really repetitve and plain boring, same thing for the story. Its intresting for a few hours and then it gets very unintresting and lacking. Also i dont know if its just me but i thought the parkour system controls were just wonky and just bad. I really tried to like this game, but its just average and repetitive

The conclusion of the story left me feeling ripped off and brought a whole new level of dissappointment.

+ Funny Orcs
+ Orcs have strengths and weaknesses (sometimes you really need strategy to kill them)
+ Good Story (Just your typical video game plot, Main character wants revenge for the death of his family and some random dude wants to join in because [spoiler] he also has intentions that will be revealed at the end of the game and he had a very big role in the LOTR universe [/spoiler]


- There's nothing else much to do in-game rather than being a walking OP killing machine
- Gets repetitive real fast
- Getting off a ledge is more of a challenge than fighting a boss
- [spoiler]A FRICKIN' 10 SECONDS QTE BOSS[/spoiler]
- FOV is too small (when in fights, the camera sometimes go through Talion. It feels like you're using GoPro or something)
- INSANE mouse acceleration (even if you change it in the options menu, it does not help. It gets annoying when you are in an intense fight and you swipe your mouse fast because you want some headshots and then the camera turns a full 360..maybe the game wants a 360 headshot? xD)

Game is great for an open world

That is the variety of orchs is the only things that i really really liked  in this game.

the rest of the game is ok game if you like monotonous and linear play. 
After the second hour you realize do the same thing over and over again and this does not change until the end. 
The gameplay is easy and its a lot of button punching.
I hoped it was going to be more like god of war but it ended up beeing just a repetitive game that makes you do everything again and again and then again one more time.  

Someone said that the definition of insanity is to do the exact thing twice and expect two different results. 
Well i went insane playing this, i did the missions that are pretty much exactly the same and all of them had the same results and this  went on from the begining to the end. 

If you are that gamer that plays dark souls then keep away from this, if you like tekken and not really thinking what you have to do then this is the game for you.

If you don't have anything good to say about something, don't say anything. I try to live by this That being said. I didn't Like this game
 I had such hopes. 
A short tutorial also gave give a little backstory. I was excited. I entered the dark and vile world of Mordor  and the story line evaporated. The game quickly became a shooting gallery, with Orcs as targets. Sure it was cast in an interesting space where there were plenty of places to go. Shure there were Orcs to sneak up on and kill. There were Caragors to maul you. Graugs to stomp you into jelly. There were fun and challenging quests.
There was blood to be spilled, throats to be cut (with a disgustib/cool sound effect) and entrails to be spread about.
There was even Gollum.
So why, you may ask didn't I like the Game?
Because, dear reader,  I like a story.  I want a tale to go with slashing and spellcasting.
And Middle Earth: Shdow of Mordor ain't got no story. 
For me it's a deal-breaker. 
Another thing that anioyed me. After a couple of Gollum quests, they just dropped him. I was looking forward to his nastyness Throughout the whole game.
I enjoyed the things I talked about at the begining. I liked riding Caragors and Graugs. Espesially the Graugs. Had a lot of fun stomping on Orcs   
I liked the Orcs dialog. In most games I quickly tire of the NPC's repetative chatter. The Orcs, with their ""dumb as a sack of rocks"" banter kept me laughing long after I had heard the same thing over and over. 
All this said I didn't finish the game. I got to the final battle, said 'why bother' and went on to somthing else
 Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. I didn't like it, but I kind of liked it, but I didn't like it
I am so confused.

An open world game with Batman-Arkham-like game play should be a win for me and yet it's not. The game is so cookie-cutter it's hard not to feel disenchanted from the start. 

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
The world is split into two parts - one giant mud moshpit and one giant greenly-retextured mud moshpit. There is really nothing to be discovered or explored simply boxes ticked. Look at your map/compass and find an artifact here or there, move onto killing captains or do the story etc. 

Unlike the Arkham games that have many story threads (and many distinct settings for that matter) for you to immerse yourself in - Middle-earth has only 3. That's it. Three. There's the main quest, a beast hunting side quest, and a gollum side quest. Other than that you collect xp through killing or collecting different types of flowers/artifacts and unlock some combat skills that really don't change the way you interact with the world much (as the skills in the Arkham games do). Further there is no puzzle solving element like the Arkham games which might have compensated for the generic world. Even taking the game on it's own terms without comparison it is a shell of a game without the depth to reward engagement. 

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Shadow of Mordor is the definition of tedious uninspired gaming."

Also, this game has the wonkiest control scheme (I test both the official Steam controller and PS3 controller with SCP support). I always play with full inverted axes, and while this game does have an option to ""invert aim axis"" IT DOES ABOLUTELY NOTHING, and there are no other options to change the (controller) control scheme. This in it of itself makes the game virtually unplayable for me. 

In addition, the camera is pretty dodgy as well. The camera is so close and so low, I fell like I could hold a decent conversation with proctologists. The fact that this game is third person with a camera that is way too close and cannot be adjusted or modified in any way, again makes this viturally unplayable for me.

I purchased this game and its accompanying DLC from the summer sale (2016) in hopes that I might be able to enjoy from my couch via Steam Link. I was clearly duped.

2247,3,0.5818,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Shadow of Mordor Review via Arkham Origins

I’m giving this game a negative vote, despite enjoying it and playing it to full achievement completion.  That may sound ingenuous of me, but I’ll give the reasons here:

1. The designers claim their combat was “inspired” by the Batman Arkham games.  This is inarguably the case, if by “inspire” you mean “copied in its entirety”.  I really mean that too.  I had just finished playing Arkham Origins, so I know what of I speak.   With the exception of branding and riding around on beasts, the combat is 100% Arkham, only there’s less of it.  The designers also say they built the engine from the ground up, and that it isn’t the Arkham engine.  I believe them, because Arkham isn’t nearly as sloppy as SoM.  I suspect if this game hadn’t had the same publisher, there would be a lawsuit.  (Actually, I think game play elements can’t be copywrited.)

1a. Okay, it’s not bad combat.  It’s actually really good.  The problem is that it’s just worse than Arkham Origins, generally accepted as the weakest Arkham game, and which received far worse reviews than SoM.  It’s simultaneously far more forgiving and far less responsive.

2. The story is sparse and extremely outside Middle-Earth canon.  The cut scenes are few and not particularly impressive.  I felt like I missed a cut scene right at the beginning (maybe I did?) because right after the prologue mission and meeting Celebrimbor in the wraith lands, I was dumped into the game proper without any really explanation of the transition.  I feel like maybe a little chat about the circumstances might have helped.
I also have no idea why they didn’t use more classic Middle-Earth assets.  Were they not licensed to use Trolls and Wargs?  Also, I’m not sure I ever heard the word “orc” once during the game.  The antagonists are persistently referred to as uruks, which is an equivalent term in canon, but rarely used in common parlance.  I was also annoyed by a couple things that seemed like they might build up to something or at least be DLC hooks that never manifested (Gollum just wandered off without comment half-way through and the spiders got a lot of lore build-up as uruk antagonists with no payoff).

2a. If you don’t care about the canon, can move past it, or can view it as an alternate reality, then the story isn’t actually bad.  I enjoyed the story and the characters didn’t fall into too many stupid clichés.  However, the cut scenes and storylines of the “inferior” Arkham Origins are better by far and there are more of them.

3. Almost everything is about the nemesis system.  You will get seriously sick of the repetitive nature of the missions and how they all tie back into the “kill/brand/promote” mechanics.  Occasionally you’ll get swarmed by captains out in the world, which is awful.

3a. It is actually a good system.  It’s interesting and fairly dynamic.  I was surprised at the variety of ways they seamlessly patched together orc quality to make the captains all seem fairly unique.  Origins doesn’t have anything comparable.

4. Collectables are all over the place, but in fairly limited numbers.  The sheer number of freeing captives missions got to be a bit much, but they pick up a little towards the end in terms of interest and difficulty.  I never really felt like I was slogging around hunting for garbage instead of playing.

4a. Screw the Riddler/Enigma and screw Arkham’s collectibles.  I’m sick of that crap.  SoM gets the point.  (We’ve been doing points?)

5. The DLC is disappointing.  It’s very much just more of the same, with minor asset changes.  They even reuse cinematics in the second one.  Each takes place in one of the two major areas of the base game, and nothing is different between them, even things that should be, such as the giant statue of Sauron under construction.  They’re not very long and not different enough to buy.

5a. They’re not actually bad.  If you already have them from a season pass or Game of the Year edition, you should give them a try.  They are different enough for some novelty.  Also, I actually didn’t play the Origins DLC, so no comparison here.

So the negative review mostly comes down to “It’s obviously worse than Arkham Origins, which scored poorly, so this should also”.  I’m actually not sure why the game was so highly rated originally.  I guess people were immensely enamored with the nemesis system, because that’s the entire selling point for it as a game."

Fifteen minutes later, I could tell that I was not going to last with this game. This game is like a watered-down version of Skyrim with Batman combat mechanics. Except, in Skyrim, there is replayability value and diverse combat system with different types of enemies and so on. Sure the game has good graphics, the world is large, and it will take a while to finish. But it lacks the most important part of a game, which is should be fun. In Skyrim, I couldn't tell what was going to happen 5 hours from now. In this game, it is easy to figure out what is going to happen from beginning to end. In Batman, I didn't only run and throw gadgets. I could fly and employ creative ways to take on bosses and solve puzzles. In this game, you will be swinging your sword and slinging arrows from beginning to end. With a skill tree it is technically an RPG, but the skill tree does not actually make much of a difference. Just like in Batman, except that Batman is not meant to be an RPG and this game is."

While everything is functional and the gameplay is mostly quite exciting, there's almost no variation in environment thoughout what I played, and nearly every mission - including side missions - appear to fall into a few categories of missions that all revolve around killing. That would be fine, if the game wasn't as easy as it is, so once you begin to unlock new abilities, slaughtering orcs quickly turns stale and boring. 

Besides the obvious problems with the lack of difficulty, the main story is bafflingly uninteresting, with suprisingly poor voice acting, giving you no real reason to keep going. The gameplay map is very small and gives you nothing to do besides killing orcs and picking up flowers.

Thirdly, the game is highly repetitive in that pretty much all you do is try to stunlock officers away from a group of minions so that you don't have to micromanage their attacks. Lastly, even the side content is pretty repetitive, like hopping around fairly identical ruined towers to find elven script on them. No idea how this got such good reviews. I have just enough motivation to see it through to the end of the game, so maybe I'll update this at that point but until then all I can say is that you might as well play Arkham City instead.

2263,3,0.5786,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I want to like this game. I really, really do. 

Pros: It's probably the first genuinely playable Lord of the Rings Game I've encountered. It's beautiful, the voice acting is great, the tone and atmosphere are perfect. I genuinely want to get to cutscenes and find out more about the wraith companion. Unfortunately, that's about all that's good about it. 

Cons: At the end of the day, this game just tried to be too much. Is it a stealth game? A ""wade through your enemies"" shoot-em-up? A strategy game? In trying to do a little of all of those, it doesn't do any of them really well. Combat is either incredibly easy (stealth kills on orcs standing right next to each other are possible as long as they aren't looking directly at their guard buddy) or impossibly difficult (good luck if you've got more than a couple of berserkers matched up with a couple of spearman). 

Continuing the story feels rewarding, but actually playing the game is exhausting. The minimap is crawling with distinct icons that are only partially explained upfront (why have at least 5 different icons representing different types of healing plants that all do the same thing?). Battles quickly stop being immersive and become about mastering key/button combinations. If you drop a player into an arena and have them fight a never-ending wave of enemies, it *should* be an exciting moment. In this game, it's just a dull series of left clicks interrupted by an occasional right click when a mouse icon appears on the screen. 

All of that is topped-off with what can quickly become a sense of hopelessness about progression, as there's no traditional save/load feature, and your enemies get stronger when they kill you. Functionally, this isn't a huge deal, but it does contribute to the overarching sense of ""why am I playing a game that just isn't fun?""

That lack of fun probably also comes from the laser-like focus on the main character. I get it, you're in Mordor where there just aren't going to be many NPCs running around, but maybe that's just not a fun way to design a game? It's got the loneliness of a horror-survival game without the tension. Maybe more conversations with the wraith, or some kind of character development system that let you choose dialogue options to customize your ranger could have given the game some character, but lacking those, it just feels like a ""kill all the orcs"" sandbox game if you try to wander away from the main plot missions. Of course, if you *don't* wander away from the main plot missions, you risk feeling underpowered by neglecting the rewards of the side missions.

If you are okay with an Assassins Creed knock-off interspersed with shallow button mashing, then the pros probably make this game worthwhile.

This game feels like an Assasins Creed mod mixed with a half baked Batman Arkham series combat system.  It's not a great AC port-the controls are extremely fickle and objects can be extremely difficult to interact with-and the combat isn't anywhere near as polished as Batman- button/joystick sensitivity seems to change at random, timing is very difficult to get down, and combinations seem to rarely work even when prompted by screen hints.  

Finally, the game just drops you into the world with little or no explanation of the story, side quests, abilities, weapons, etc.  You just feel drowning in options with little guidances.

The map/enviroment is extremly small. It takes you only a minute to run from one end to the other.

The orc respawning is ridiculous, you kill a archer, turn around and get shot in the back from another archer in the same spot.

But the outermost baddest thing are the controls. 3 or 4 functions on the same key with nealy no distinction between diffrent states. 
And running off cliffs/obstacles/walls is the real big major pain in the a.. 
your avatar is stopping almost every second because he thinks he cant walk further. This buggy behaviour costs you a lot of lifes and health and nerves mid-fight. Because you want to run away, but cant do so because he simply needs millions of key-presses until he realizes you really want to jump of the ledge.


The hit-streak counter is buggy as well, it is nearly impossible to reach a x100 counter, and it is not because I am not able to fight but the avatar aint doing what Im telling. For example, two opponents try to attack me, the block symbol appears over their head, Im pressing the correct buttons in the right time, but my avatar stands still and does nothing. Or the other way around, they try to attack me, I block but they aborted their attack mid-fight so my block goes into nothing and the hit-counter resets. And sometimes they attack instantly from standstill in a tenth of a second even with the block symbol only visible for a millisecond. And when I see they want to attack and press the block button a little earlier then the block symbol appears, the counter will reset as well.

So in short, the game mechanics arent developed and tested well and have lot of room for improvement.

This game is honestly kind of shit. The story is barebones and uninteresting. The main villain is beaten through (and this is no exaggeration) a three-button quicktime event. You press three buttons to save the world.

Then again, you'll be doing this for most of the game too. The combat system isn't exactly amazing. It's pure Arkham. You counter an enemy by pressing a button when they attack you, then slash them a bit. You can upgrade your character in a few ways to add some fancy new moves, but ultimately the basis of all combat is just counters. It's not great.

It can also be finished in about 8 hours. There is side content and stuff like that, thankfully, but the main story is boring and short and really not the highlight of the game.

So, what is the highlight? Why am I still recommending something that, so far, sounds like a fucking trainwreck?

Because of something called the nemesis system. You can become a prominent figure in Orc politics by just killing, maiming and enslaving orcs. The gist of the system is that there is an interconnected hierarchy of orc ""captains"". Each captain is an orc that has their own fears, weaknesses, strengths and such. Each captain can be killed by playing against their weaknesses, as they are actually somewhat challenging sometimes to fight head on. One of them might just chuck poisoned spears at you, one might use smoke bombs, another might have a ramming ability. They're all auto generated, which makes the game a lot like a rougelike in a way.

The best part of this system is that you can fuck with this hierarchy. One captain dislikes another? Fuck with some communications, make them meet. Work with an orc to create an ambush against another. Command an enslaved orc to try and capture and execute another. Since a lot of these orc captains are very powerful, you can use your political power to weaken them beforehand, arranging ambushes and drawing them into places where you can beat them easily.

Ultimately, playing against a captain's weaknesses isn't hard. They can be pretty easy to exploit.

Another great part of this system is that you can create your own captains. Let someone kill you in battle, resurrect a while later, find that this guy has grown from a measly orc grunt to a captain, and he's killed his way into the hierarchy. This guy is going to keep rising in power as he completes ""power struggles"", which are events that you can interfere with. As he grows stronger, he can even become a warlord, and you can see his weaknesses disappearing one by one as you create a true monster. 

Maybe you'll realize what a monster you've created and try to kill him. Maybe he's still weak to fire, so you'll blast him with fire arrows. Maybe he'll burn to death in a ditch somewhere. Maybe a while later, the same orc will rise from the grave with your scent at the end of his nose and stalk you across the entire world to take revenge. Maybe his name is ""Ronk Skull-Cracker"". Maybe he's so spurred by his literal roasting that he changes his name to ""Ronk the Unkillable"" and loses every single weakness he ever had, before launching into a fucking jihad across the game's world. Maybe he even appears in the second game, because he's so fucking persistent. MAYBE I'm using present tense for a reason.

captains are real fun to fight. Play the game for them. Don't even bother finishing the story tbh. Infact, just get the second game, Shadow of War. it's this one but expanded hugely. Made the fun parts a lot more fun. In fact, I was going to recommend this game, but in hindsight, nah. Get Shadow of War instead. There's really no difference between the two except that the second game is better."

Sometimes you have to dodge over enemies wearing shields or dodge out of the way of arrows/spears and the combat starts to kinda require you to pay attention but you can easily turn invisible by simply spamming the dodge button. I am not joking, spam the dodge button and nothing can hit you.

4) No standard equipment to be collected. You'll always be using the same sword, the same bow and the same dagger, while never finding or putting any armor on.

5) Sexism. Women in this game are mewling inepts, who need to be rescued by the dashing male main character. Even the supposed strong warrior woman in the plot stands and walks like she's afraid of imminent diarrhea. There is no real option to play as a female character.

JULY 11, 2016 | 11:31AM PT

Warner Bros. paid PewDiePie and other digital stars upwards of tens of thousands of dollars each to promote a 2014 game based on the world of J.R.R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” without properly disclosing the arrangements, according to the Federal Trade Commission.


Under a settlement WB reached with the FTC, announced Monday, Warner Bros. has agreed to make such disclosures in the future.

The FTC charges stem for Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment’s video game “Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,” first released in September 2014, for which it paid influencers to post positive gameplay videos on YouTube and social media. The sponsored videos were viewed more than 5.5 million times, with PewDiePie’s sponsored video alone viewed more than 3.7 million times.


“Consumers have the right to know if reviewers are providing their own opinions or paid sales pitches,” Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement. “Companies like Warner Brothers need to be straight with consumers in their online ad campaigns.”

In a statement, the studio said, “Warner Bros. Home Entertainment always strives to be transparent with our customers and fans when working with social influencers, and we are committed to complying with the related FTC guidelines.”

PewDiePie, who is the No. 1 most-subscribed individual creator on YouTube with more than 46 million followers, is affiliated with Disney’s Maker Studios. Reps for Maker did not respond to a request for comment. Other digital influencers enlisted by WB for the “Shadow of Mordor” promos, according to the FTC, included I Am Wildcat, Silentc0re and Siv HD.

It’s not the first time marketers have run afoul of the FTC’s rules requiring disclosure about paid promotions by digital influencers. Last fall, Machinima reached a settlement with the agency after an FTC investigation into promotional videos for Microsoft’s Xbox One system and games.

According to the FTC, Warner Bros. enlisted ad agency Plaid Social Labs to hire online influencers to develop sponsored gameplay videos for “Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor,” post them on YouTube and promote them on Twitter and Facebook. WB paid from “hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars” to each influencer and gave them a free, pre-release version of the game, and told them to not disclose any bugs they discovered, according to the complaint. In addition, Warner Bros. failed to instruct the influencers to include sponsorship disclosures “clearly and conspicuously” in the videos themselves, but instead told them to put disclosures in the description field of the videos, the FTC said.

With the campaign, according to the FTC, Warner Bros. misled consumers “by suggesting that the gameplay videos of ‘Shadow of Mordor’ reflected the independent or objective views of the influencers.”

Shadows of Mordor is super forgiving when it comes to the stealth aspect of the game which makes it kind of overpowered. But I found it logical to depend on stealth while you slowly build up your combat powers. The power progress is really nice. You can be easily overwhelmed by the enemies early on, but late game you feel powerful enough to take on a stronghold in open combat. But the game still provides enough challenge.

The Nemesis system is well designed. And taking out targets is much more enjoyable than something like Assassin's Creed's system.

Having played it for quite a few hours I would say that it does have some good ideas.  The story in interesting, the combat is dynamic and fun, and the level up system is useful.

Unfortunately, there are several things that lead to a lot of frustration and at least one game breaking thing.  To start the controls are sluggish and often with the over lap of funtions mapped to the same button, your character often does something other than you intended.  This is the same problem that most third person action games have.

As for the unforgivible flaw, it cheats.  The most blatant one was when I went to fight a Warchief and went to strike the finishing blow, the game goes into a cut scene.  The Warchief says that I shouldn't kill him.  Having no reason not to kill him I hit the attack button again, at which point it goes into a slowmo scene where he blocks my attack and hits me.  My character stumbles to the ground and the Warchief laughs at me and then disapears.  This was an openly blatant cheat on the part of the game.  If you can't kill the Warchiefs, which the game has told you needs to be done in order to complete the game, what is the point in playing?

So while most of the gameplay and story are fun, if the game will not let you win then this is a bad game."

The gameplay is well polished, and despite some minor issues with the climbing, stealth, combat system which don't intereact well together (if you want to get out of combat or climb while in combat, its finnicky), it is a well crafted game. I didn't find it particularly challenging, and toward sthe end it got pretty damn easy. Yes the ""Nemesis"" system is cool and can make for some fun fights i guess, but I never felt particularly challenged. sometimes I got frustrated with gimmicks as a warchief got almost impossible to beat, but that was based off a GIMMICK of making him immune to everything, not actually better. 

The story was pretty blahhh, tragic backstories for both characters, but I never felt any connection. Both the main characters are uninteresting to me, because they are both so stoic and boring. *Hint: the character might have to feel some emotion on screen for me to feel emotion as a player.  In fact the only character to actually have character was Torvin the dwarf, he was hilarious, serious props. 

All in all I consider this a watered down Witcher 2 with a couple gimmicks thrown in. It is less fun, less interesting, less challenging, and has less story. If you really dig Middle Earth and the world from LOTR, this is going to be a great experience for you. But as someone who is passingly familiar, I did not feel any engagement when they did some fleshing out storywise. I could not care who the outcasts are, or even where everything is spacially, just kept skipping along looking to kill a warchief or do a story mission.

At the time of writing this game is overwhelmingly positive on steam. O.o.

Tried it in 2016. Gave up half way. Thumbs down. Started to doubt myself. Gave it another go and played to the end. Still thumbs down. Ultimately, while there are flashes of genius to be found for every good thing the game does, it falls flat at the same time. 

For example... This is a game with some very interesting experimental mechanics. You would have heard about the nemesis system, where you can actually take on orc leaders in combat, control their minds, and turn them against each other. This is all fun and good stuff. But ultimately you never really have to engage that much with the system to beat the game. You are never called on to be that strategic and read the strengths and weaknesses of a boss. Identify a guy. Go to him. Kill him or control him. Rinse and repeat. The system is there, but the difficulty is not strong enough to force the player to really study up and come with a plan.

Or take combat. The core of combat is fairly good, especially early on when you are up against 30 orcs at once. It's based on the Batman series of brawlers by WB, so if you have played those you know what to expect. The problem is that the player is basically a walking god. Once you have a few upgrades any fight becomes laughably easy. For example, you can launch 14 or so ghost arrows and slay half a squad in slo-mow. In the Batman series, esp with difficulty set to high, you have to fight damn hard to come out on top. I just finished a play through in SoM by contrast where I died ONCE. ONCE. I say it again. ONCE. No challenge = snooze. 

How about story? There were some people on the team who were clearly into LoTR. Like, people who read the Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales for fun. That kind of level. These people were in charge of crafting the back story lore. There's plenty of snippets of text, bits and pieces in cut scenes which are top notch. You really cant fault the cut scenes that reveal the story of Celebrimbor, or the little bits of text you unearth as items around the world. Problem is all the rest of the writing. The characters are terrible. The main character is just.... there is nothing remotely interesting or likeable about him. From beginning to end you never have a reason to care about any of it.

I could go on. So I will. There's lots the game does well with respects to character design. The orcs look GREAT. And there's heaps of variety. So many different faces, names, styles of armor, etc. etc. But then you have a main character who has some kind of disturbingly weird horse face that freaks you out whenever it is on screen. WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAACE? Or what about the world? Really cool opening area by the black gate. Atmospheric. Grim. Makes you think of LoTR book 3 once they get into Mordor. Then half way through they go and send you to some generic grassy hilly area that could be lifted from practically anywhere else. The mid game gets interesting as you work to take over control of the orcs and use them against Sauron. Then at the end of the game you have boss fights which are literally just pressing space bar a couple of times, and moving your mouse into a circle and pressing E. Seriously. The difficulty level at times is just insulting. 

In summary it is a hot mess of a game. Undercooked by 6-12 months at least. It needed a bigger more interesting map, it needed better characters, gameplay balancing, and difficulty modes. etc. A 19 hour campaign is not terrible, but it is kind of strange for a game with deep systems. It just speaks to a lack of funding and a rush to get it out the door.

To be clear, this is still a very potentially interesting game. It drips with potential and talent, and I can understand why it was favorably reviewed when it came out. There is a lot to admire when all is said and done. So I do think it is worth grabbing on sale and playing about for a bit. But I can't really recommend it as a good game. Otherwise, I imagine that Shadows of War is now the polished version of the concept, a bit like AC Oddysey is to Origins."

You can kill any captain with ease even at the start of the game, and they are supposed to be tough. Not to mention you can't die, so if you want someone dead, you can bugger and bastardize someone until they die.

The campaign is completely dull. It lasts about 3 hours of no clear story. You go somewhere, do that, then go somewhere else and do that. And toward the end of the game you learn how to brand out of thin air, Talion is like ""Let's brand them."", literally. There was no mission leading up to it, the ability just appeared.

The only reason I have this many hours on the game is because I tried to play the shit out of it, because Valve is stingy with the refunds. Most of that time went into dicking around with the nemesis system, which is actually cool. Basically anyone in the world can become a 'Unique' enemy in your game, even the grunts. Except they share the same voices, have the same dull remarks, drop like flies, replace good perks with shitty ones that just kill their guys, and all of them are monster slayers."

Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a well made game. It runs well and it is interesting from the lore perspective of someone who is a fan of the Tolkien mythology. 

So why am I not recommending a purchase of this game?

Its boring. Granted the first hour or so was really entertaining, but the game feels very much like Batman or Assassin's Creed. I mean it feels shallow. Hunting down and killing the captains and warlords is fun the first couple of times you do it, but once you see that the slain are being replaced you lose the sense of progression. It feels completely pointless to go around killing the captains. 

The upgrade system also feels shallow. You get runes and skill upgrades, sure, but they are very generic and uninteresting. You can upgrade your health, stamina, weapon slots, and combos/special moves but you don't really get a sense of character development. From the get-go your character is a supreme badass compared to the legions of rabble trying to gut you. You don't really even need special moves/combos through the unlock system to feel badass. Just as long as you're able to hit the ""counter"" button and dodge arrows you're going to be able to take down enemies far outside the intended progression. 


I'm sure lots of people are really into this game. But I can't recommend it. Its too similar to the Batman/Assassin's Creed games to be worth playing through. It feels just as generic and shallow as the other games I mentioned and suffers from the same critical failure. It just isn't that much fun doing the same stuff over and over and over and over and over again while you are toted along the generic plot."
2324,3,0.6572,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","It plays exactly like the batman arkham games. If you dont like the combat in the batman games, you very likely wont like this game either.

2325,3,0.4896,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","The game in a nutshell:
I remember Yahtzee Croshaw referring once to the gaming industry as one being based on ripping every one another off. Hardly surprising, but what I found suprising is the degree to which this game is derivative. Talion looks so reminiscent of Saints Row 4's The Boss, it's as if someone loaded his model in an RPG face editor and played around with the sliders. Combat is borrowed from Batman: Arkham, right down to Batman's beatdown finishers in Arkham City. Running and climbing - Assassin's Creed. That's all I could gather from the 2 hours I spent playing it before I requested my refund.

However that's not what ultimately turned me off. The gameplay is moderately satisfying. But I did experience a noticeable screen tearing, even with VSync turned on. The game offers the option to limit the FPS additionally (in fact it suggested one should limit the FPS and turn on VSync at the same time). This only made the tearing worse. And so, I found myself browsing a Steam forums thread that supposedly provided a fix. Turns out it was a known issue.

I have made a point to ascertain after playing a game for a couple of hours whether I really want to keep it in my library. Most of us have quite a lot of games that we don't play, but have spent money on. Thus, I had a choice to either spend time trying to fix issues in basic graphics, and enjoy an otherwise mediocre game or get my 12.49 bucks back.

This game is worth far less than 12.49 euro/dollars/pounds."

At this point, I've uninstalled the game. I'm not going to try it again. I've chalked it up to a waste of time and money.

2328,4,0.6478,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Not good.

Combat consists of you getting mobbed and that's about it. Which would be fine if the execution wasn't terrible. Every fight devolves into dodge-attack-dodge-attack and nothing else. Worse yet, some of the mobs are endless. You'll go to kill a boss in a 'stronghold', get mobbed, take everyone out, start going after the boss, another mob rolls in. Sometimes another boss will get involved in the fight at which point don't bother.

There's no targeting system so far as I can tell. Every input just seems like a suggestion. Sometimes you'll have to 'interrogate' a specific NPC. You go to do that, get mobbed, are unable to grab the NPC you want because you can't target him, it devolves into dodge-attack-dodge-attack restart the mission (because he died in the process).

The combat is too reliant on finishers. Again, fine, whatever, it's just that they don't work. It takes 3-4 seconds to do a finisher, and you're vulnerable during, since combat consists of nothing but being mobbed you can never finish one. You'll go to snuff out the guy you just knocked over, get hit, and he'll just stand on back up. Which means that, drum roll please, it devolves into dodge-attack-dodge-attack

There's no enemy variety, like four different kind of orc and one animal that isn't just fodder. Each orc type requires a different tactic to take on as you'd expect. The issue is you'll get mobbed by multiple orc types at the same time, since you can't target you can't intelligently deal with that, it devolves into dodge-attack-dodge-attack restart the mission (because you died).

The controls are hammy and confused. You'll try to scale a wall and it'll just keep triggering your dash ability. You'll have to chase after a 'terrified' boss to finish him off, you'll wind up scaling random walls. 

There are side ""quests"". I love side quests. These side quests suck. There's no meaning behind them, just pointless treasure hunts. Find this glyph just because, find this hidden item and hear a little story you're in no way engaged with.

I hate it when games waste the player's time like that.

It's well-known in the gaming industry right now that making players repeatedly have to travel over the same territory, whether it's a fetch quest or between missions, is a cheap and annoying way to extend gameplay time. It would have been wholly sufficient, and still manageably frustrating, to make the player repeat the mission from the beginning without having them have to monotonously travel back to it.  (The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the mission where you have to fight through ghul caves with the ghul matrons.)

As it is, frustration level too high for me.  Do NOT buy this unless you have a very high tolerance for frustration and patience with having to run several minutes to return to a mission location repeatedly."

I wanted to enjoy this game, but a combination of tedious combat that's really no more than a glorified quick time event, frequently sloppy controls, and the randomness introduced by the nemesis system (specifically captains frequently wandering into me during missions making them extra frustrating and sometimes near impossible) resulted in me spending more of my hours with this game ready to throw my controller out the window rather than actually having fun.

The open world portion is a joke, the two explorable areas are relatively small and boring with bleak landscapes and copy paste ruins. The story includes some interesting elements from the simarillion, but appears to be cut short (the last two boss fights are so easy they feel completely out of place).

Overall, while I enjoyed parts of the game, there were more parts I did not and the lack of interesting things to do outside of endlessly slaughtering orcs means I can't honestly recommend this game at the asking price."

I had my eyes on this game for quite a while, without having seen much video or anything about it. I caught this GOTY game on sale for about $13. Had I paid full price, I would have been quite disapointed

The short and sweet review of the game is that it just wasn't long enough or challenging enough for the cost associated with it. At $13, I'm not disappointed, but I can't reccomend the game at full price. By exploring and killing captains first thing, I ended up overpowering myself in both unlockables, runes, and knowledge of map exploits. This made the game unchallenging and tedious since the objectives were to do things I had already been doing over and over again, only now I get a congratulations at the end.

The game can be beaten by click mashing the left mouse button, while keeping an eye out for quick-time alerts of right click counters, or rolling/jumping over people (same button). In a Dark-Souls-sort-of-way, it's all about paying attention to dodge moments. But unfortunately, there isn't much variety to that since they're just quick time events =/. Sure you can use throwing daggers or even the ground pound light thing, but you simply don't NEED it. You really can beat the game through mashing, and that bummed me out."

I played this game for around 7 hours according to steam. The game itself is made fairly well. Good combat system, good movement system, well optimized on lower end PCs. My progress in the game was about 13%-14%, so I saw a fair amount of the content the game had to offer. 

You play as a one (or two man army) in a world filled with Uruks fighting you and eachother for dominance and power. The rival and targeting system is really good but unfortunately this is where I have to give it a negative. Now, I haven't played Assassin's Creed in quite a while, so I'm sure by now my opinion on that type of game has changed because here is my stance. This game is nothing special. While the lore of Middle Earth is always fairly well made, I never found anything that really grabbed me. The combat featured very few new items (which were in fact well developed I think). Most of the missions just felt like a sort of copy-paste formula. It was another game with a big map where all you do is kill people. It didn't seem fun to me anymore I guess.

5/10 You can get Assassin's Creed 2 for like $20 or something idk"

Train the player (in-game) in swords combat or at least offer more guidance as of how far he is, add different difficulty settings (probably not possible since all players in the world can compare their stats with each other - something I couldn't care less about) or offer cheats for those boring casual players such as myself.

2369,4,0.5895,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","I really wanted to like this game since I heard so many good things about it (waited until it went on sale for cheap to pick up the GotY edition), but the combat is incredibly frustrating. Maybe it gets better once I've gotten better at it, but it's so un-fun that I don't really want to keep at it until I'm better at it.

Basically, every fight consists of me vs. 5 or 6 other guys. They're weak and easy to knock down, but if I don't use a finishing move on them, they get back up and keep attacking me within a few seconds. The finishing move takes long enough that the other guys come and attack me while I'm doing it (and I can't take many attacks until I'm dead), and if I stop to block the attack, I can't complete my finishing move and that guy gets back up. They can't really hurt me when I'm NOT trying to do a finishing move, so it's basically a stalemate that keeps going until I finally manage to knock down enough of them at the same time that I can get one finishing move out before they all get back up and keep fighting, repeat until I finally kill them all. I died three times trying to complete the very first mission, and I'm not yet having any fun at all.

Maybe it's because I'm trying to play this on PC without a gamepad? The keyboard controls are really hard to get used to, constantly asking me to hold shift while clicking during combat to do some things, press left-control (one of the least convenient keys to press with that hand) to do others, hold down shift to sneak. This seems like it would be much more intuitive to use if I had shoulder buttons to hold down instead of awkward keyboard modifiers, but so many of the modifiers are context-specific that it's hard to keep track of what combinations do what in each situation.

I have to tap right-click to block, but if I hold it down for too long (because in most other games I've played where I can block, I have to be holding down block when the attack actually connects and it's really hard to break this habit), I go into ranged mode and start trying to shoot people while in the middle of a melee. Oh, and I've only got four arrow shots before I run out, I often need more than one to kill an enemy (I'm not sure how to see health bars for non-chief enemies so it's a complete mystery how many arrows I'll need to kill a particular guy), and draining energy from living enemies is the only way to get more arrows.

The movement feels really imprecise and awkward, too. I move faster while sneaking than I do while walking (which is super super slow) but I have to hold down shift the entire time I'm sneaking. Spacebar is used to run and jump and climb, resulting in times where I wanted to jump down from a platform onto the ground below (your character won't fall off ledges unless you tell him to) and ended up discovering that I could hold onto ropes on the sides of towers because my character instead decided to leap clear across the gap to grab onto a rope on the side of a building on the other side. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to tell him to jump to one place instead of another, he just kinda goes where he wants to.

All in all, I spent about an hour in this game, managed to kill one uruk chief, haven't the slightest idea where the next one is because even though I can choose him as my target it doesn't mark him on my map at all like it did the first one, and I can't even go exploring because around every corner is a group of five or six orcs all facing different directions preventing me from sneaking up and killing even one of them from stealth before they all attack me, and I don't have any reliable source of arrows to pick them off at a distance. I think I'll just give up now."

2371,3,0.4747,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","So I finally got around to playing this... Shadow of Mordor, a game with a fancey production value, but very limited in scope. This game is a casualty of the ""sandbox"" influence. When a game is so overly designed to be a sandbox, none of the freedoms the game allows the player seem significant at all. What makes the sandbox aspect of games like GTA work is that the game is such a standard racing game or standard shooter in so many ways, so when it allows you that bit of freedom, it feels really special. Mordor, on the other hand, feels like everything is sort of there waiting for you, and nothing you do is really outside of what the game designers thought you would think to do. So this sort of game with one basic goal, hack and slash at orcs, would have worked much  better as a linear adventure game. As it is, you spend lots of time running from fights looking for arrows or healing herbs, wandering around, and running around the same stone ruins in the same setting for hours upon hours. While this game does have some nice movie sequences with good voice acting and great animation, graphics, and ambient sound, they are few and far between, and there is NOTHING that happens outside of Mordor, you are LOCKED into the same small bleak landscape for the entire game, and the look of it gets old, fast. Also, the terrain is all wrong for the type of parkour your character does, and the controls can get jerky at times, however the fighting is pretty solid, just very very repetitive. Where this games shines is the many different faces, stats, and other variables in the orc army, which shifts and evolves depending on the player's actions. There are no save or load screens, and getting killed in the game has real consequences. Just like you, your legions of enemies can retreat, regroup, gain XP, gain abilities, and level up. This creates immense strategic importance for timing your raids on enemy outposts. Did you botch your mission and get whacked? Well, sorry, but that lieutenant who pounded you got promoted and is now even tougher to beat, so you better not loose again to him. That's a pretty ingenious mechanic for a game like this, similiar to the turf war aspect of GTA: Vice City Stories, but much more dynamic and well detailed. (The orcs really is where the detail and production value of this game shines.) These gang war and army hierarchy mechanics are taken to their zenith in the DLC where you play as the Bright Lord, where you actuly recruit your own armies of orcs to accompany you on raids against your enemies. The Bright Lord campaign really is the best part of Mordor, however it is marred by some missions with VERY obtuse requirements, some of which just kill the fun and immersion factors. Again, just because you can climb all over everything doesn't make it a true ""sandbox,"" rather, being able to accomplish goals with any means possible would make this game a true sandbox, which it just isn't, If you're looking for a sandbox RPG, check out SkyRim. If you're looking for a GOOD sandbox RPG, check out UltimaVII. Shadow of Mordor is a fairly solid hack and slash game with many fun and streamlined mechanics from sandbox games sprinkled in, and no annoying inventory system to mess with. In the end, the game is solid but extremely limited in scope, and utterly repetitive. 5.5/10 Get it on sale."

You need 19+ control mappings, so good luck hitting the right key to do what you need at the time. Meanwhile run, jump, and climb are all the same key so you stick to every wall while chasing enemies and tumble along the ground when trying to climb to safety. Mounted animals have a three meter turning radius, so give up on ever attacking with one. Combine that with N64-era camera movement that leaves you half blind. Using this, you are expected to kill 20-30 orcs at a time because you never have fewer than that and they spawn out of thin air on top of you almost indefinitely. Even a mission ""kill this captain and his 5 guards"" is almost impossible as you can kill 4 of them with arrows before being spotted, but then still cannot even close the distance before two dozen appear everywhere. Naturally, there's no targetting control, so you have to kill ALL of them before you can lock onto the captain. And even the captain system is broken, as you'll occasionally be up against enemies immune to melee damage, immune to back attacks, and immune to ranged damage too. Good luck, invincible enemies. And sinced there's no actual progression, you'll see these guys from the first five minutes, because there isn't any progression. At least there's a plot? Nope. The opening tutorial dumps you into the game with no introduction, no explanation, no setup. You are just ""banished from death"" and now I guess you fight uruks. Why? How did I get here? What is this elf ghost? Who knows, the writers didn't think that mattered. 100% utter failure from every angle.

So, ur probably wondering ""then what's the problem? why are you disliking the game then?"". 
The reason i vote no for this game anyway, is because when you get into a fight in it (wich you do 99.99% of the time), you will NEVER get out of it again, if you don't tend to flee after 10 min. of intense fighting. 
Im not saying that i don't like the fighting, because that is pretty much the reason you buy this game because of all the epic fighting. Im just saying that there also need to be an end sometime... 
I really don't like that you will never get to an end of an epic battle, if you don't flee yourself. 
Also i think that the system this game is build on, the ranks of the uruks, and how they increase in rank is a little bit stupid, because if you tend to die ALL the time to the same Uruk, that Uruk will just keep increasing in rank. well, that doesn't sound too bad actually, but it is. Because if you as said keep dying and the Uruk keeps Ranking up, he will get to be impossible in the end. Like, litterally... I mean, you can't kill him. And if that Uruk was just OP from the start before he killed you the first time and ranked up, he will just only keep getting even more OP.

So, what i'm saying.

I think this game is great, i mean look at the epic swordfights it just look incredible and all the different powers that you can get are super awesome and very well thougth through.
Also the graphics are very nice, and the story too for that matter.

So, i like the ""fighting"", but not the fight itself, because the fight itself, as i explained, is just endless and pointless, and it will just drive you mad in the end because if you don't flee at last, you will just die instead.

Oh, i also forgot to mention the climbing. I think that it's amazing that you can climb in this game, AND also that you can mount the games two wild beasts! the Graug and the Caragor. And there really are some nice sidequests too.

But still, even after all these thing that i like about the game, is will still not recommend it because of the fights.

If you want a game with substance and story, as someone might expect with the Lord of the Rings label, then avoid this game or wait for a heavy discount on a steam sale. The bulk of the lore seemed to come from reading about the collectables you find strewn around the map. If I wanted to read about the LOTR world I would read LOTR. (The collectables also added nothing to the game. Just an achievement.)

This game felt all about chasing mission markers around a map with extremely repetative quests. While perhaps ""realistic"", I found it frustrating that killed captains would so quickly be replaced and create an endless cycle of icons I could never finish clearing.

The combat wanted to feel very similar to the Batman Arkham games although Talion doesn't seem to move as smooth. It also didn't help that during missions or running into a captain all the combat grinds to a halt for a cut scene or update. I might be in the thick of 20 orcs but I have to listen to a captain shout at me (about how he's going to kill me, run away ect) and it completely breaks up the flow of the combat. This was especially frustrating when trying to brand (hypnotize) captains. The game would pause itself to give me the update of the mission (ex: my previously branded orc won the duel). Then it would immediately pause itself again as the captain taunts me as he starts to retreat. Then the constant accidental attacking my branded orcs. If I can't even intentionally attack the human slaves then it would seem fair that I can't accidentally attack the orcs brought over to my side if I'm in a big mosh pit of a battle.

Final boss ""fight"" is a quick time event. ....

Very bad cover mixed together game from 2 great games, but a very bad mix.
- Assassin's Creed, the tower thingie and ""open world""
- badman combatsystem (i would say ripoff, but it's from the same studio so...)
The other features are very useless cheap and not even worth mentioning

Overall: i don't know the LOTR thing and i don't saw the movies or read the books. i only played this game as gamer and not fanboy. My review is on gaming, not fan worshiping! So if you are a fanboy and i hurt your feeling - go fk yourself.

The biggest problem is that the gameplay realy suxx. Yes it's quiet fast and the skills are maybe fun, but after a very little time you always use the same skills, you got maybe another skill after a little time, but overall it's again and again the same thing. This would be so bad for a combatsystem like batman was, if there was any sense in it. the skills you use, are only the slaugter endless waves of enemys and for absolute no reason. if the tower is anyway alarted, the senseless wavekilling starts. you need killed tons of enemys and why?... ehm no fkin clue, only to kill 1 general that is absolute senseless immun to your arrow, so that you have go closecombat with your sword against hundrest of enemys... very sad Dev-Team, very sad.

The controlls realy suxx, i played this game with an XBox-Controller and it's quiet unbearable to play this game. you very often jump uncontrolled from towers (mostly in a horde of enemys) or crawl abwards a wall in the wrong direction. If you want go stealth (as i think the games want you to) than this will be pain in your ass. you often have to wrong target, arrows stuck in invisible walls and a long range hit often let you miss the target because it arrow disappear. the riding is absolute useless, you nealy never come close anoth to this big dogs (?) to jump on them.

The story maybe would be any fun, if you can play the story without this breaks. you need to run through the whole map dozens of time for absolute no reason. the finding of targets maybe would be fun, if there where any reason for this. you kill one another comes, you kill that, another comes... and so on."

Old good review:
I didn't know there was a Nemesis System in this game.  If I had I would have played this game years sooner.  It's a mix between Arkham's fighting system and Assassin's Creed climbing system, but it feels slightly watered down for both.  Not in a bad way, the game gets more complex the more abilities you unlock but in the beginning I was dying a lot and created a few Uruk enemies that are still chasing me to this day.

Spacebar does just about every action and there is no real way to lock a target with everything going on, leading to your character flailing his sword at enemies who block and/or counter attack. I've lost count of the amount of times where I've tried focusing on one Orc to take him down then when I would land the last blow on him, your character turns and hits an Orc at full health on the other side of the fight; it's just frustrating and I can't bring myself to finish it because of that. Ruined by lazy porting of the controls.

Speaking of which, the gameplay is basically a direct clone of games like Assassin's creed or the Arkham series; not a bad thing in itself as I enjoyed the combat in Arkham, but there is really nothing new here. The much touted political gameplay is complete crap, as you would imagine, basically boiling down to you having to do very linear quests in order to truely effect the system in a very linear way, which in itself only allows you to progress to the next linear story mission anyway.

A shame, because the combat does feel really cool when it works... it just doesn't most of the time, thanks to 3 buttons out of the dozens at your disposal on your keyboard being used for every action, leading you to roll when you want to vault, climb when you want to roll, and vault when you want to run. Let's not even get into the abundance of quick-time events. It seems like the devs saw this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BnLbv6QYcA and decided that it was a great idea, deciding to base their control scheme around it.

Before we get to this point a quick overview:
The world is the area around the black gate, which in the Lord of the Rings universe marks the border between the Land of Mordor and Gondor. You begin at a time, when the black gate is the very eastern outpost of gondor. However it gets overrun by orcs and now it is your task to free the gondorian side of the border.
With relatively deep characters and amazingly creative mechanics, this game gets pretty close to the tales of Tolkien and its very good movie adaptation.
Seen this way the game is among the best games of the decade so far. Sadly a dark shadow of failiure covers this elsewise epic title:
The game suffers at it's two cores: action fights and stealth gameplay. While the fights are probably intended to be very hard, the stealth is not. One mechanic of shadows of mordor is responsible for the near imposibillity of this game: orcs can smell you from quite a distance. You often cannot sneak past an orc or silently approach it without being mentioned and thereby risking an alert of all orcs in a 100 up to 200 meter radius. This relatively realistic mechanic destroys the whole experience of the game and makes it unforgivingly hard. In addition to that some fights are automatically triggered and not avoidable. As a consequence you often get stuck with an unforgiving and brutally hard fight.
Sadly also this Lord of the Rings game failed (at least in my eyes) letting us waiting for a probably impossible epic RPG set in middleearth."

Ranged attacks are so incomprehensibly slow and awkward as to render them little more than items to collect and otherwise can be roundly ignored, save for the occasional moment where everything suddenly depends upon them.

To put it plainly, this is a mindless, uninspired, and deeply frustrating attempt at a game.  There is nothing fun or interesting in any way whatever.

I love difficulty, my hundreds of hours on DaS and Dragon's Dogma combined should say as much, but this game just flat kills you with no way to win. There are enemies in the game that throw spears, you're familiar with them having never played the game being that they are a sort of game trope. Normally these enemies do minimal damage, throw infrequently, and can be killed easily, in Mordor they do excruciating damage, throw fast, and are very tough to kill. This game is not an RPG in the sense of stat growth, so you're never going to kill them easier, I at first thought this could not be the case and looked up strategy guides, which state you should ""kill them first"". The problem is they are rarely around until you're in the middle of a horde, at which point merely reaching them is very hard due to the game's sticky targeting, and you will be constantly interrupted just trying to attack them, both by melee and other spear enemies.

You might say ""Well get better at the game"", but seven hours in and having done a x200 chain, with no abilities in the tree that helps with these enemies I can't see how it's a skill gap. You might say ""Well it's only a few ranged"", sadly it is not, the game leans harshly on infinite spawning, meaning in a horde of melee orcs suddenly on all sides there are twelve spear enemies, and you are dead moments later if you don't spam jump, but you can never kill anything effectively, and if you do kill, more come, leading to endless ranged attrition. You say ""Run away then"", and here in lies why I laid the game down, it puts you in many situations, for missions, for timed events, where if you run away you simply fail, or in a main mission where you cannot run away, while also putting you in no-win scenarios.

People have strongly compared Mordor to Batman, and while the Arkham Knight PC version was a debacle of a different sort the gameplay worked(in between Bat Crashes), Mordor does take heavily, but it uses a ranged enemy trope very ineffectively, and it kills your ability to really do anything in the game.

I wouldn't be suprised if the same exact skeleton was borrowed from AC and reskinned. The parkour mechanics are identical right down to the animations, plus they kept the ""climb up to that tower and do something to unlock the region"" nonsense. You're forced to do the same 5-6 events over and over, the only thing that seems to change is the place you're doing it, and even then there are ""nodes"" that tend to be reused ad nauseum, making you go back to the same places over and over to either kill something, mind control it, or help it kill something else. By the way - the stealth mechanics are laughable. I was able to sprint through a campsite filled with enemies in broad daylight and got no aggro at all.

Ultimately, I gave up trying to like this game around the time you had to brand the warchiefs because I noticed that after some time, the majority of your mechanics are rendered invalid by the immunities that the targets stack. At one point I was faced with a warchief that was immune to stealth finishers, immune to ranged attacks, could not be counterattacked, healed on every strike, poisoned with every strike, became enraged at the sight of Caragors, had the ability that lets him kill beasts faster, and became enraged when a follower was harmed (he was being escorted by FOUR of them!)

The feeling I got from this was that they discovered many players would simply ambush their targets and kill them instantly (EXACTLY WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING IN A STEALTH GAME!) forcing them to shoehorn in a bunch of these terrible immunity mechanics to invalidate the majority of the skills you've learned up to that point.

It's not a good game. It's not even a mediocre game. It's a really bad joke cobbled together from the pieces of a superior franchise. If you really love the world Tolkein created and you just HAVE to play this game, do yourself a favor and pirate it, or if you feel dirty about that sort of thing, wait until you can get it for less than ten dollars, because that truly is all it's worth.

I give it a 3/10 only because the landscapes were well done.


TL;DR - You could power a small city with the energy created by Tolkein rolling over in his grave. That's how bad this game is. Devs should be ashamed of themselves. Do not buy."

I couldn't help but feel like I was playing Batman when fighting off orcs or Assassin's Creed when obsessively visiting spots on the map. The execution overall seemed solid but in trying to be so many things at once Mordor really fails to be memorable. They sacrifice a strong story in favor of exploration elements - which is disappointing for a game set in the history rich Tolkien universe. The exploration leaves a bit to be desired as well, at some point you will feel like you are just moving through a check list because every destination is very plainly laid out for you. 

Much has been talked about in regards to the ""nemesis"" system which I personally found to be a bit over hyped. At first, it is a cool mechanic and then you quickly realize that the effect on the universe is really minimal and not worth the time.

The combat is well done for what it is, and it looks great. There's just something about it that gets old real fast for me.

I liked the idea of the named boss orcs that you take out as some sort of power play, but after taking out a few I couldn't  see the point other than ""boss fight with loot"".

2480,3,0.6472,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Before you read my review, keep in mind that I only chose ''Not Recommended'' because there is no mid-term between yes and no here in the steam review system. With that in mind, lets keep going:
Shadow of Mordor is an awesome game with a very good battle system, but the story is only there to fill a context. The first story missions got my attention, but along the way I lost interest in the motivation of the characters. And there's another problem as well: the story missions don't differ at all from what you already do when you are exploring the map and 90% of the time they don't take you to a new place: you just walk in the same map, and if you are like me, exploring 100% of the map, this will certainly keep you bored. 
Speaking of 100%, I completed entirely every single thing there is to do in the main game, and the sense of reward here was utterly disappointing. I took all the collectibles and the only thing I got was a text and an audio reading it. Oh, and an achievement, but seriously, I was expecting way more. 
The boss fights were disappointing, again. The enemies are no different from what you already face in the map, and the final bosses are ridiculous. 4 stealth kills and some quick time events. Seriously? The creativity was lacking or Warner pushed the company to deliver the game unfinished like it always do? We will never know, but this completely killed my interest in the DLCs.
Even with that, I tried to play the Lord of the Hunt and the Shining Lord DLCs, but I just couldn't finish them. Lord of the Hunt takes you TO THE SAME FUCKING MAP IN THE MAIN GAME and you have some missions to do, and some new monsters to ride. The problem is that those monsters are just the same monsters you know with one or two new abilities, and the core of the missions and the collectible are the same from the main game. Congratulations, you lazy bastards.
I played the Shining Lord DLC for 10 minutes and got out to review the game and lay it to rest. Some new and different abilities, but not enough. Again, the same mission's core mechanics of the main game and the Lord of the Hunt campaign: Kill or Brand 5 warchiefs, build forge towers, bla bla bla. Companies nowadays should learn from CD Projekt Red how to make a real DLC.
Even with all those flaws, the combat is awesome, and the Nemesis system is really good. If you are killed by an enemy, this enemy will grow stronger and even get promoted, and you will earn points for getting revenge at it. The gameplay is really fun, to make me complete 100% of the game even with the flaws.
With that said, get it on a sale, because it's not worth full price."

It's not that it's a bad game, but it's definitely not what I was let to believe by the trailers.  The game is basically one giant open world map filled with orcs to kill and orc leaders to assassinate.  If you like an open combat orc killing simulator this is exactly the game you want.  If you want any story whatsoever, you'll be disappointed like me."
2498,3,0.4296,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Initially, when I heard about this game, I wasn't impressed by it. It was basically just a rip-off of Assassin's Creed and Batman. Plus, it was Warner Brothers, and they're infamous for milking IPs they hold the rights to and making bad games with them just to keep it going. Things like Guardians of Middle-earth, War in the North, and ruining Lord of the Rings online when they bought Turbine.

However, I decided to try it. I wasn't wrong about it ripping off AC and Bats. But I was pleasantly surprised to find it didn't feel stale. They did just enough to make it enjoyable. For example, the use of a bow felt like a good choice. And the way you'd just scope out a stronghold, decide how you want to go about it (stealth, sniper, or sword-fuelled mayhem), then get things done.

It wasn't until later in the game that I started to enjoy it more. The ability to teleport to enemies in range and either knock them down or execute them was exactly what I felt was missing initially. Free-running was alright, but Batman allowed you to fly around and AC had way more buildings to scale, so this game needed something to allow for quick travel around a stronghold.

Some may already know, but there is this 'mechanic' called the Nemesis System. Now I'm not impressed with it. It's fairly basic stuff; kill an orc, someone else takes it place. They make it seem like everything is random, but you really don't get that feeling. Just the same selection of orcs, but occasionally there's that single orc you can't execute, stun, range, or even hit head on and you either just lead him to fires or spam the AOE wraith skill near him. Sure, you can brainwash some orcs and help them to the top, but then you have no bosses to fight so it's boring. It needs more to it to feel worthwhile. As it stands currently, it was a lot of hype over nothing special.

But there is one thing that irks me: they play fast and loose with the lore of Middle-earth. I love Tolkien's world. It's one of the few out there that make me feel like it has true depth to it. When it comes to SoM, they just didn't seem to know what the ambience is like. A half-wraith, half-human thing as the protaganist fits in nowhere. Wraiths are all bound by Sauron, so they wouldn't be good. Celebrimbor did not help with the One Ring, Sauron made it entirely alone and in secret. There's a Dwarf that has no beard, just some mutton chops. All in all, it's not really much like Middle-earth, and just another blatant attempt for Warner Brothers to milk the IP they own.

Overall, if you can get this game at a 75% discount or higher, then get it. I bought the key for here elsewhere simply because it was cheaper... and the less money that goes to Warner Brothers, the better.

EDIT: Having now completed the game, I'm changing my mind.

There are literally only two small maps to play through (Nurn and Udun). I was expecting at least twice that.

The main boss fights are really boring. The first is just the same as an other captain/warchief fight. The second is just stealth branding 4 clones of the enemy. But the last one really takes the cake: it's a quick time event that lasts maybe 15 seconds, has you click 4 buttons and then the game ends.

It's very similar in playstyle to Batman Arkham City or Arkham Asylum, best played with a controller. I used an Xbox 360 wired controller, it had native support for it and worked well as far as control and combat fluidity just like the Batman games!

Unfortunately, it's a massive hand-hurting experience like the batman games. It's not that I can't handle fast paced combat (I did beat all the previous Batman games with similar style) it's just that it gets so obnoxious when you're fighting generic ""weak"" enemies that require obnoxious amounts of button presses to take down. 

The objective is to fight your way up the ladder of Orks. Now the innovative part is if you screw up fighting one of these incredibly detailed and unique looking orc generals, you end up getting bumped back down the ladder. I actually don't want to finish this game at this point, it's just so repetitive. If I had a dollar for everytime I fought an Uruk general and his cronies took me out with a lousy cheap shot costing me the fight and getting bumped down a ladder, I'd probably be able to bribe my way to Sauron... or refund my money for the $60 release day purchase.

There are unique Uruk's that have quirks, voices, etc. It's actually a very well done game as far as voices, controls, and graphics go. It's just the implementation that ruins it, here's the math formula:

(painful button mash attack/counters * 20 enemies per area * 10 areas before you hit the boss * 10 ladder positions of Uruk's * X amount of screw ups forcing you to run back and kill the enemies again) / sanity level before you uninstall game. I played 6 hours before I gave up, would not recommend unless you got on the under $10 cheap.

When I first started playing the game, I thought it was great. Combat similar to the Arkham series. Unique mooks, some of whom keep coming back to haunt you. It was very interesting and had just the right amount of challenge to make you feel like a badass, while still having to rely on skill.

By the time I got to the end, however, I was disappoint. My character had amassed in power so much that fighting anybody was a joke. I could literally run into any place and never fear being defeated. The middle boss battle against the Hammer was pretty decent, but the whole end sequence and final boss battles were a joke.
I wouldn't have even got around to doing them, had I known, but I had done everything else and trying to build the best orc army (finding all the perfect captains for my warchiefs) had become incredibly repetitive.

Mechanics wise it is an excellent game, but it feels very souless. The story is incredibly lacking. Too much went into trying to show off their nemesis system, and not enough went into the actual game. If it had some more memorable bosses or interesting settings, with this system along side it, then this would have been a wonderful game, but as of now it feels hollow.
Even things like learning how to ride Graugs felt empty, since after doing it the first time there was literally no reason to ever do it again.

I pressed three buttons and the game was over. I was so frustrated I just left the DLC I bought in a bundle to gather dust.

I would not recommend this game. The only exception I can think of is someone who is more concerned about playing a LOTR game than they are with playing a well-crafted fighting game.

Super anti-climactic ending aside, I thought the core gameplay was very fun (albeit very repetitive). 

I once spent an entire evening mind controlling every captain and warchief on the map. I figured I'd get an achievement or something. Instead, the game forces the last empty slot in the army to never fill so you will always be one captain short of controlling the ENTIRE army. Very frustrating.

Gameplay is also very easy. Combat is never challenging unless you intentionally fight in such a way (as I ended up doing) so as to up the chances of dying in order to establish some sort of risk. Max power warchiefs can be taken down in seconds, whereas some lower-level captains can have a combination of attributes that make them unkillable killing machines.

Cool LOTR world
Fun fighting mechanics

Battles stretch on forever; tedious affairs where you roll and jump around while being interrupted the whole time by new captains giving you speeches about how cool they are. Get ready to die often, especially at the beginning when you haven't levelled and you don't know the game, mostly because everything is poorly explained. The game is basically Assassin's Creed set in Mordor, which should be fun, except it just isn't for some reason. Enemies respawn too quickly and too often making battles dull, areas you clean out don't stay clean making the accomplishment feel pointless.

Bosses show up from nowhere while you're busy fighting other enemies and one shot you.

This game has a couple of things that ruin it for me:

1. OP Targets in massive hideouts; Some targets you need to assassinate (kill) walk around surrounded by 20 more enemies in a massive base. Some targets arent affected by stealth attacks, which makes it more of a problem to kill. So, you attack, you discover that you cant hit him from the front, you get attacked by 20 more enemies, you spend a couple of minutes to kill those, target still not killed, one enemy activates the alarm, 40 more enemies attack you, you spend 10 minutes slashing them all up, and you die by the second to last enemy that stopped you from eliminating your target. And the worst part is that this makes your target even stronger.
2. Captains that stop you from killing your target captain; So you attack your target with few enemies around, he's almost dead, aaaaand another captain that stops you from killing it, aaaaaand another one, aaaaand another one. You manage to kill your target but you get killed by the 5 other captains that started attacking you, which all gain more power and become an absolute pain in the behind.

This might seem pretty reasonable to some, but I have a strong feeling that this is still the easy part.

Another problem is that it gets repetitive really quick. You spend 90% of your time hacking and slashing through hordes and hordes and hordes and hordes and hordes of enemies. The other 10% you spend holding the crouch button (I couldnt find a toggle option) to sneak around, but you'll get yourself into trouble soon enough.

The beginning of the story was impressive and dramatic, tutorial was alright and so were the first couple hours of orc slaying. But while I have progressed into the game I was wondering is there anything other to that game than orc slaughtering? Nope. The entire game is little more than a hack'n'slash rpg.

And it actually wouldn't be half as bad if there was a certain diversity in the ways of killing orcs. Considering the whole game is about killing stuff from fancy angles I would expect no less ways to kill than in Dishonored, but unfortunately I didn't see that either.

In particular there are 3 ways to kill enemies: with sword, with dagger and with bow. With sword its risky and time-consuming and can get you swarmed faster than you are able to deal with enemies. Dagger is fast but can be used only in stealth mode and bow is straight up a free win option.

Most missions (which are pretty repetitive and boring by the way) you will have to sneak around killing orcs with dagger because bow shots are limited in a way so the game largely depends on its stealth element. And that stealth element is pretty poor and undeveloped, you can assassinate a target even several seconds after they saw you and prepared to attack you. Some other missions you can resolve just with a couple of bow shots which so conveniently instakill even certain ""boss"" enemies.

But even if you manage to fail your assassination attempt and find yourself overwhelmed by enemies you can just take out your trusty bow and clean up the area since fortunately while you are aiming the time slows down by about 99% and you can easily land instakilling headshots.

The RPG element in the game is also extremely disappointing, the story which starts so well is progressed by the main mission and by optional collectibles and frankly its pretty damn cliche, especially to people familiar to the LotR universe. You can collect the loot and level up your character gaining ability points to learn abilities which can be unlocked by doing side-quests (which are also boring and repetitive just like the main quest line).

To sum it up the game deserves a solid 6.5/10. It's ok to buy it on one of the sales on which apparently it goes pretty often. However I don't get how such a game gets a major spotlight while many better games such as Styx: the master of shadows, Darksiders and Dishonored don't get all the recognition they deserve."

2552,3,0.5653,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","The game is not bad, but is dissapointing for a game based on the LOTR franchise, you have one of the richest lore and world there is, yet, the maps are small and there is not much to do in them, it kind of fell small, does not help the maps are not that big either, as a open world exploration game is quite poor, the story is well, there, but dont expect much from it.

The combat mechanics are ok, niceanimations and you can take on a ton of enemies while dodging and executing them, makign combos, etc... but is not as refined as other games many times I find myself unable to target the enemy I want, this is made worse by the large number of enemies in small spaces making the combat just cumbersome. also the ork captains and warchiefs, they all have a little introduction, was ok at first but got old fast and kills the flow of the combat, still si fun jsut to get in kill a bunch of orks to relief stress.

On the 3D models and graphics, to be clear, beside the orks that are procedurally generated and can show some nice features overall the bad guys and monsters are ok, the human characters and the enviroment models are just average..., the main character has several stuff on its body that jsut floats around, having no animation, I can understand this with multiple armors and weaposn but the character has a single set of armor, and the hair... these things would pass for a secondary character but not for the protagonist, the facial animations are far from the best I have seen.

hen we have the ending, that is at best anticlimatic, not only the fight with the last boss... but supossedly you raise an army to fight the bad guy, then you show up with 5 guys agaisnt 10 - 15 guys ... does not feel epic at all.

if you want a game about going killing orks is a fun game, and do that ok, just dont expect much more from it, I would not get it unless its on sale, if you are looking for a openworld game right now there are much better open world games out there with bigger worlds and much more exploration for the same price, and if your looking for combat, theres also better options in my opinion."
2553,3,0.6389,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This game starts out pretty decent with a nice story intro and good looking cutscenes and at the same time you are introduced to the combat mechanics. 
 
After the intro you are dropped on the map and have to kill Orcs and extract intel from them. You do this ala Batman/Creed style which is very enjoyable... at first. 
 
After exploring the map a bit and killing Orcs you soon notice that this is all the gameplay you will get out of the game. The entire game you will be killing Orcs and doing the same thing, even with nice combat mechanics this will get dull and repetitive fast.
 
However, my main reason for thumbing down this game is because of the intense ugly map you have to play on. And with the map I mean the 'terrain', not the objects on the map.The map design looks like it has been made by a hobbyist with a terrain painter program. Even I could create a map that would be no less to this map in this 'AAA' game. To give you a hint, this map uses cardboardbox 2D background mountains that are glued on the skybox surrounding the map. 2D mountains are really unacceptable for a new big budget game... even on a console. The terrain itself has been made with a terrain painter (brushed terrain). The Mountains and plateau's they have created looks so amateurish and were designed with a total lack of creativity.
 
If you are only interested in a 100% hack & slash game then this game will do the job. 
The animations, voices, cutscenes are all of acceptable quality, but it is lacking in a lot of other aspects. If this game would have been created by a small indie dev team then I might have thumbed it up, but this is suposed to be a big budget AAA game and it's to under par for that.
 
I refunded it and bought something else instead.

This game is not the game lord of the rings used to release in the beginning of the series. The game changed a lot and it has a different purpose than following a story and completing missions as they go. the game starts giving a story then you have to be stuck in a huge map killing orcs for hours until you level up. you are stuck in a big map which takes forever to reach your destination and get to see the same areas over and over again. all you do is run around and kill all the monsters by yourself. these monsters talk too much and i don't remember them talking this much in the movies, it seems that they learned a lot of english and it is really annoying. if you die, you will respawn somewhere far to extend the game play. these developers don't want you to beat the game too fast so, they made the game to take everything forever eg: killing, leveing and running around for extend amount of time is not fun, a game that it doesnt take to the point becomes very dull and doesn't need strategy at all. strategy is part of videogames but this seems to be too simple but very boring. story is weak, fighting is the same crap over and over again, the map is huge and you are running around for hours, before you kill the boss you gotta kill 100 other monsters first and even after killing that much you will barely level up.

+ looks good
+ character expressions are excellent (unfortunately this doesn't include Talion)
+ voices are fitting
+ nemesis system is interesting
+ I enjoyed branding orcs a lot more than I probably should have

- tiny world
- clunky movement, as well as even more clunky combat movement
- lots of positioning and movement bugs (can't climb onto some ledges which are clearly climbable, as well as jumping from a lot of ledges takes multiple tries because he just wouldn't do it - expecially annoying when chasing down a fleeing captain/warchief)
- if it wasn't for the LOTR background, the game would have nothing going for it setting-wise
- story is very bland and clichee-ridden
- RNG is annoying in this game; if you're unlucky you'll get a nearly-unkillable captain/warchief
- very short game, not counting the side missions
- game feels rushed and uninspired altogether
- mission-breaking bugs (branding orcs in a recruitment mission will not complete the mission for example)
- caragors and graugs feel unnecessary and with shadow mount are ridiculously underpowered

So, did I enjoy it? Yeah, because I like open-world games. Would I recommend it? No. The game has little replay value and is riddled with bugs."
2589,3,0.6618,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This is an atrociously lazy game. TL;DR: it's not worth full price; not even close. It might be worth about $15 at most. The gameplay isn't significantly different from One Finger Death Punch, which I got on GoG for a dollar. Graphics are significantly better, but in service of a meaningless and uninteresting story.

The Good:
+ Decent basic gameplay mechanics; fighting is fun and fast
+ Interesting Uruk Captain and Warchief mechanic
+ AAA graphics
+ Stalking and fighting captians and warchiefs can be fun

The Bad:
- Terrible, awful, contemptable final 2 boss ""fights""
   - Seriously...
   - The second to last fight has you just stealth attacking an enemy who just wanders about aimlessly 3 times.
   - The last fight... the boss of the damn game... is a 3 button quick time event.
   - No prior fight, no use of the game's core mechanics whatsoever, just a QTE.
   - That is fucking disgraceful.
- Fights become pathetically easy after mid-game (even warchief fights)
- Ranged enemies are not well thought out (few to no counters and little to no indication that they're attacking you)
- The story... it might as well not exist.
- Gollum is shoehorned in. Seriously, he serves no purpose to the plot.
- Characters are not developed at all, and quickly shuffled away.
- Several hunt quests with Torvin the Dwarf are marked as main quests and yet contribute nothing to the plot.
- Game canon says your main character can not die. Why not just throw himself at the horde until they're all dead?
- ""Banished from death"", give me a fuckin' break.
- Nonsensical and completely irrelevant ""twist"" at the end.
- The combat is a 3 trick pony. It gets old about 10 hours before the game is over (1/2 way).

At first, I liked the gameplay enough to excuse the lack of plot and characters. After about 10 hours (1/2 way through) I got bored of the mechanics, as nothing new or interesting was introduced, and the plot and characters were still garbage. The ending... the final 2 bosses ruined all the goodwill I had. Fuck this game. It only feels like a complete waste of time.

No thought involved, no real strategy or tactics. There's no real puzzles or mazes to adventure through, and from other reviews. There's no real skill trees, other than adding some ability that makes your standard arsenal more powerful, and by other reviewers, this means you get to a point where your so OP there's no point in playing.

The game is very intense, the combat brutal and violent. I do like it, but the problem is it's just a continous extreme of intensity, something that I know I would get desensitized too quickly. A good game will be a like an epic poem, with ups and downs,. The story of a slave to a god, with plenty of gaps, lulls and respites inbetween.

This game you go from battling 20 orcs to another 20 orcs to another 20 orcs all within minutes of each other.. forever..

I know they tried to add depth to this game in the nemesis system, but something went wrong in the design and or implementation of it. 

Ideas to improve upon a sequel:

More tactical combat, ala street fighter and more 1 on 1s or 1 v 2s.
Conversely,. less 1 vs 20-30 people every other battle where you just use the same moves over and over. 
It overwhelms combat and makes it thin and souless. 

Different types of challenges that aren't combat or gatherer related. Like navigating platforms and sneaking through dungeons. 

A real skill tree which leads to different end game characters.

More modifiers like poison, fire, ice and different armours you must get to face these opponents. 

Artistic environment missions with a special boss or challenge to face at the end of it. This way the player can enjoy the beautiful world but still feel like they are accomplishing something... Like get to the top of a mountain and take a picture of some monolith. This picture will give you a bonus vs all enemies in the monolith, something like that..

2594,3,0.4624,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. Is it worth getting? Let’s have a look.

ME:SOM is similar to the Batman games in terms of the combat. The one button to attack and one to block, when prompted, and you can dodge etc. I think it’s fun and if you like the combat in Batman/Mad Max you will like this one even more as, as you level up, you’ll be lopping heads off left, right, and centre. 

As for the levelling up system, it is fun and, unlike Batman and Mad Max, actually makes a difference. At the start of the game, you will be running away from the smallest groups of Orcs as you will quickly get overwhelmed, but as the game goes on and you level up, you will be able to take on massive groups of Orcs and War Chiefs all at once and come away with the heads of your fallen enemies. Unfortunately, although the levelling up system is good, there is little emphasis put on alerting you to when you can level up and the tutorial for the different trees doesn’t exist, for example, in my play through, I didn’t even know there was a second level up tree until I accidently clicked a button and scrolled across to it. This is simply laziness on their part. 

The story is just a joke, which is why this review is negative. It tries desperately to get you to care about the protagonist, Talion, but you just don’t. Not only that, but if you are a hardcore LOTR fan, you will be angered by this games inability to follow the lore and the fact that the developers have tried to add things to the game in a desperate attempt to feel that they have added something into a world that Tolkien has already created. The Nemesis system is nothing fantastic either. You will have certain Orcs that are Chiefs or War Chiefs and the only difference being how many times you have to hit them with your sword before they die, which is a lot more. Usually they become Chiefs by killing you or just because the RNG system puts them into the world. 

The wraith skills are fun to use such as taking control of Orcs, which is the best skill, (you only get this skill in the last quarter of the game) but it just simply doesn’t work in the world unless it is a scripted event in the game. You brand them (which is basically taking control of them) and then you can click a button to call them into battle, but like it said, if it isn’t scripted, they just saunter off, leaving you to fight alone. 

Overall, if you’re thinking of getting this because A. You’re a hardcore LOTR fan or B. Just because you like the look of it, don’t. And if you must, get it REALLY cheap. You will be disappointed."

Open world stuff like collectibles are boring and pointless - go to a mappin, press RB, use interaction and perhaps listen to some boring, out of context monologue that doesn't explain anything and doesn't build up any lore.

And most importantly - killing orcs in an area could potentially be fine and actually fun since the combat itself, being a clone of a good system is also good, if not the fact that each time you kill some orcs, multiple others (often more than you've killed!) respawn basically 10 meters away, putting you in a potentially never ending combat. It's seriously missing Far Cry like outpost liberation. Here you kill some orcs, go away, return to the spot and see all your actions were meaningless. 

What's the point of playing then?"

But the gameplay, at the core, is just like Batman and Assassin's Creed. 
Same old counter attack fighting.
Different enemy types that need to be disarmed, evaded, beat down, or countered. Except this time, with some enemies you have to counter attack them like 3 times. 
Theres somethings that make it slightly different than AC and Batman witht the combat, but it'll still feel like you're playing AC, LoTR themed."

Playing this is an exercise in frustration. Nothing you do matters, every goal you accomplish is temporary and tangential, and even marauding through the battlefield quickly becomes a slog.

you start with a list of 25 captains, and have to interrogate their mooks to learn about them. Learning about them is kinda pointless, as the only interaction you have is killing them. It might be fun to know that “gromwell the curmudgeonly” dislikes mcguffin flies, but that's only useful if you can find mcguffin flies within the mission zone, and you desperately need to fail the mission because your target ran away.  Some captains are vulnerable or immune to certain attacks, but this system is layered on top of a rock-paper-scisors melee-mook setup; I.e. frequently a shield captain will appear that is immune to the one attack that works against shields.

The only way to get to your target is stealth, and getting caught causes every hostile in the area to come join in. Fighting through is largely futile, as the legally-distinct-for-legal-reasons “Uruks” respawn as soon as you look the other way, frequently in the middle of combat. The arkham style combat system that rapidly breaks down on larger groups, plus there are ranged mooks that can just shoot you, no defence. I found it difficult to keep even a small fight manageable, and anything more then 8 was indecipherable chaos. 

If you manage to engage your target, the insult has not ended. If the melee gets large enough (i.e. more then 5 or 6 dudes) then the game will call in a captain to join in. since the captain comes with 5 or so mooks, the battle is immediately large enough to summon more captains. In less then a minute, you can be introduced to 4 captains, each with 5-10 mooks, plus whatever random groups are wandering around nearby. Many times you'll fight an hour long losing war of attrition against hundreds of mooks, just to get to the point where you can start chipping away at the captains, only to die to a unblockable spear-thrower that just spawned in. to make matters worse, sometimes when you do manage to kill a captain, it's not actually killed; the same exact captain will pop up in the middle of some other battle and play some handwavy prerecorded line about not actually being dead that time you put a broadsword through it's head. 

it doesn't help that the story is impenetrable to anyone who doesn't speak native elvish. I know the movies and have read at least some of the books, and I barely could keep track of what was going on with the plot that was so carefully suspended above (but conspicuously out of reach of) the uruk org chart simulator. 

All in all, it's ok, and i'll probably play another hour or two waiting for something better to come along, but I bought it on deep discount, and it was barely worth while."

- Found the gameplay to be a mix between Assassin's Creed and the Arkham games, which always bored me. There's very little need for tactical approaches.

- The graphics are terrible for the hardware requirements, and I'm running an i7-3770k @ 4.3ghz with two GTX 980's in SLI. 

- The AI is terrible. You can sneak up way too easily behind enemies without having to actually try and the only thing they know how to do is swarm you, which still isn't a big deal because countering is easy to pull off.

- Didn't care about the characters or what was going on for the most part (I'm a huge LOTR fan btw).

Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a fun game. The combat is fun, it's intuitive, smooth, and it feels natural as fuck. Normally I am all about following the story and seeing how it plays out. This was the first game where I didn't give a shit about that for twelve hours. All I wanted to do was walk in to strongholds, kill Orcs, kill captains, and leave destruction behind me. I totally emptied three strongholds with stealth alone and killed over 4000 Orcs in my time through the game. The combat is SO MUCH FUN!

And none of it means shit. You know why? Because there is no depth to this game and because the only boss that has an actual fight is the first boss. The second boss is a fake stealth routine (Fake because he knows you're there and you're just fighting his magic rather than him) and then has a quick time event to kill him. The final boss isn't even that much. Admittedly, you have to kill fight Uruk Warchiefs to get to the final boss but, I don't consider that to be the boss fight. I killed captains and warchiefs all the time, killing five more meant nothing.

When I climbed The Black Gate to get to The Black Hand I expected an epic, one-on-one fight with an enemy worthy of being Talion's arch-nemesis. What I did not expect was a six button quick-time event that took all of ten seconds. Not even exaggerating, it took ten seconds to kill The Black Hand. Sorry, no, not The Black Hand. He takes Celebrimbor from and turns in to fucking Sauron, who then takes ten seconds to kill.

MOTHER FUCKING SAURON DIES TO A QUICK-TIME EVENT! Nevermind the massive re-writing of lore, nevermind the repeat quests, nevermind the ZERO DEPTH to this game! MOTHER, GOD-DAMNED, FUCKING SAURON! DIES TO A FUCKING QUICK-TIME EVENT! I know that this is a personal feeling but, for me everything went right out the god damned window for me when it happened.

Is the game fun? Certainly. I enjoyed every moment up until the end. Would I recommend this game? Fuck no. Why the hell would I recommend a game that leaves me feeling not just disappointed but empty? The ending was so shit, so pointless, that I felt like nothing I did in that entire game mattered in even the slightest way. I could brand every warchief, every captain, every ORC, turn Sauron's army against him, and it still would feel like I did jack all.

Sauron deserved better than that bullshit."

Kill them again
Kill some bosses

You kill them

I just literally told you exactly the entire game. Yes there were 1 or 2 really new and cool ideas implimented, But they added those features, slapped a LOTR tag on it and sold it as fast as they could. There is absolutely no depth this game at all whatsoever. Its the same boring shit over and over again. 
Do you remember the first Assassin's Creed? Where you literally did the same things over and over and over again, but it was very new and cool? This is the same thing. If you want to pay money to enjoy the first 30 minutes, and then do the same thing over and over again, by all means, Go waste your money :)

****UPDATE**** I tried this game out again... and OMFG..... its the same boring fucking game it was when I first played it lol.

More often than not you will be over whelmed by about 10-15 captains and 25ish regular orcs.  Then you have to some how target a very specific character in the sea of monsters to some how magicaly mark without the enemy disrupting your marking process.  To top all of that off all of the capt/cheifs have roughly 7 sec intros each so about 1 min you just stand there either dieing or unable to mark the desired target and is allowed to flee while you are stuck in an unskippable intro loops to each capt.  VERY POOR GAME DESIGN!!!  Wish I would have read reviews before purchase would have saved me 60 dollars.
2621,3,0.3696,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","It's really a gorgeous game. But I could only play it for about 45 min. before it became too repetitive and samey. The combat is so monotonously boring I had to request a refund ASAP. As far as I can tell, the intro tries to make it all about some kind of story-driven experience or something, but it really just comes across like every other game I've played lately. I'd rather the plot was, ""Hey, Sauron's stirring up trouble. Go fight his hordes of baddies until you win."" 15 second exposition, then right into gameplay (the intro was like 15-20 min. of my time?). I watched Destiny's video on Youtube about how horrible the combat was, but experiencing how stale and easy it is right from the outset was something else entirely. Dude was spot on trashing it like he did.

Overall, if you are all about LOTR and don't care about solid gameplay, you will lap this title up and downvote this review. So it goes.....

Follow up from free weekend: This might be the largest game (~80 GB) that I've ever wasted my internet bandwidth on. I was giving this game a second go and skipping the cutscenes to simply evaluate the combat, which sometimes has improved games for me in the past. What a mistake. Combat is laughably easy, even with the indicators off. There also doesn't feel to be much weight behind the sword swings. Killing enemies by necessitating the use of the crouch feature is also awkward. It worked in the Batman games, which this one is clearly trying to copy. But in a faster paced action game vs. a stealth game like Batman, it just ruins the pacing of things. I think my final moments before uninstalling were unlocking the Executions ability, then accidentally fighting a war chief, building up the combo meter to use the execution, and then my character literally exploded. While I was winning the fight. W.T.F. Are there that many blind LOTR fans that bought this and will buy the sequel? Pitiful"

*Graphics- Decent but not exactly spectacular even on full ultra settings, it doesn't really look like a next gen game.

*Soundtrack- Has its moments but never really strikes a chord of poignance which is bad considering the content..

*Combat- The most praised feature, i have no idea why its just button mashing and hitting space bar to remain invincible even when being attacked by 20+ orcs.

*Storyline- I enjoyed seeing the Bright Lord and finding notes and artifacts but the actual protagonist is very dull and boring. I never really cared about him or his past he was Aragorn model 101.

*Nemesis system- This was the one part i found a good bit of fun. However that too became a bit boring after a number of hours. It was a good feature and maybe should have been the focus of the game instead.

*Game length- Ive heard anything from 30 to 200 hours. I finished the main story in 16 hours. The rest is just filler, much like contracts in Assassin's Creed or Rifts in Dragon Age. Im sure if you get really into the Nemesis system and complete all that filler you can have a 50+ hour game but really why would you?

    [*]The gameplay is pretty well done. Assassin's Creed style combat done right. 
    [*]The story and characters start out interesting enough. Even some comedy once you get past the whole family murdering part. 
    [*]Upgrades are useful but shear numbers and four or five Uruk Captains still a bit challenging. Captains together with the right ability combo can be impossible to fight head on. 
    [*]Stealth system works. Mostly a simple line of sight system and the stupid Uruks. Best part, if they notice you, they're still startled so you can use the stealth kill/attack. 
[/list]


CON
[list]
    [*]JUST ONE. THE LAST 1/4th OF THE GAME. The ending completely fails. Gameplay and story wise. 

This game peters the FUCK out. Some shit happens off screen to characters they tried starting some emotional investment in. You can do all this work to build a Uruk army of 5 BA Warchiefs, doesn't really pay off. Use them for one skirmish, and there is a pre-rendered scene where you ship off with them. So they look nothing like your dudes. ALL THAT MINOR SHIT ASIDE. The last two boss battles, [spoiler]  Creepy no lips Uruk dude? Been fucking with you recently? He seems kinda OP? Jump on his back a few times!... Final boss leader guy who killed you/your family? Kills himself! Becomes Sauron! OH SHIT! Mash keys in quick time event to kill him?	[/spoiler]

2661,3,0.4781,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Ah, [b]J. R. R. Tolkien[/b]… When I took the copy of [b]The Hobbit[/b] from my school library (I was like seven years old), my life changed once and for all. Well, a lot of people can say the same, since [b]J. R. R. Tolkien[/b]’s [b]TheLord of the Rings[/b] nowadays is like one of the biggest franchises ever. And, of course, since we’re talking about something that big, you can easily guess that there’s a lot of video games based on [b]J. R. R. Tolkien[/b]’s works. There are all kinds of them, from the interactive fiction to MMORPG, but this time [b]WB[/b] decided to make a single player open world sandbox for us. And that’s exactly where it becomes complicated. It’s really hard to decide how to rate this game.

On the one hand, it looks [b][i]really[/i][/b] nice. Graphics are OK (nothing special, but OK, especially with the free HD DLC), presentation is epic, voice-over is professional and expensive… It’s everything you may expect from AAA title. It looks and feels great. Also, this game comes with the really cool battle system. It looks extremely dull at the beginning (one button to attack, one button to block and one button to roll), but the more you’ll play, the more complicated it’ll get. This game literally uses the whole controller and it’ll take you some time to learn and master all the moves and tricks. I really like the battle system here. It’s well polished, complicated and addictive. You can have fun just by fighting monsters. And since there’ll be hordes of them (I’m not kidding, even if you’ll start fighting a single Uruk, he’ll call his friends and there’ll be dozens of them around you right away, you just can’t run out of enemies here), it’s like there’s infinite amount of fun.

Unfortunately, that’s it. There’s nothing else to do in this game. The whole game is just two maps with the hordes of the similar looking Uruks on them. The end. There are story missions, of course, but there are only 20 of them and, obviously, it isn’t enough. Especially since the story is pretty poor. It has a great background, but story itself is poor and predictable (you can also count all the NPCs in this game by using only your fingers). The rest of the time it’ll be a lot like Shadow of the Colossus, but without colossi themselves. You run around the map (or ride on one of the two types of the monsters), collect herbs, shoot some small stuff, etc. Just to get some points for upgrades. That’s it, to get points to upgrade your stuff, you need to walk around and get some collectibles. That’s how desperate developers were. They were unable to produce enough content, so, they just forced us to walk around and look for stuff. Imagine [b]Batman[/b] solving the riddles in [b]Arkham City[/b] for power ups. Everything you need is shown on the map, though, so, it’s more like a repetitive process. And that’s the word for this game - [i]repetitive[/i].

Another thing about this game is that [b]WB[/b] asked for [b]Batman[/b] game again. [b]Arkham[/b] series sells well, [b]WB[/b] knows that and wants to make the same thing from the other franchises too. That’s the idea here. You don’t need glasses to see [b]Batman[/b] in this game. There’s a 50/50 mix of stealth and beat ‘em up, main character is all about climbing the high places, we’ll use the special abilities to see the “invisible” traces and spot the enemies through objects, we’ll walk around the open world and follow the markers on the map… It’s [b]Arkham[/b] series! And, well, it feels like a cheap move. Like “Hey! [b]Batman[/b] sells well! Let’s turn everything into [b]Batman[/b]!”

That’s basically it. As I’ve already said, it’s really hard to tell if Shadow of Mordor worth it, or not. If you want stylish sandbox with some stealth and great battle system, check it out. If you like [b]Arkham[/b] series and want something similar, but without Batman, it’s for you. But if you want a proper game, where you need to actually achieve something, you’ll get disappointed and bored [i]really[/i] quickly. Like I did. [b]Shadow of Mordor[/b] is a nice game, buried under the tons of sand. If you can’t enjoy the sand, it’s not worth digging. Also, it’s really, [i]really[/i] buggy and [b]WB[/b] just don’t care. In my case, after I’ve cleared 94% of the game, the game erased my savegame and rejected to save again even after I’ve started the new playthrough. There’s a lot of topics with this problem around the net, but even though those started to appear right after the initial release, [b]WB[/b] still didn’t say a word about it, because, well, they’re treating PC gamers like trash. So, not only you’ll need to manually backup your save file all the time, you’ll also need to check the timestamp to make sure that the game is still using / updating it. All in all, even if there’s a chance for some people to like this game, this exact version is a royal pain in the neck. Can't recommend both the game and this exact version."

Summary: Main quest + mini boss grind + repetetive combat + collectables = a 'mehh' reskin of BATMAN which gets boring quickly.... Worth a lower price tag maybe.
Conclusion: Great example of how WB takes what works and repackages it for cash cow purposes


This game can best described as a batman port to the LOTR world - which isn't entirely a bad thing I suppose, but after an hour or two it becomes boring and tedious. The world/map is not terribly creative or thought out. The game literally takes the elements from the batman series and ports them using LOTR lore to explain them. 

The orc heirarchy system has been praised, but its really as simple as when you lose, the miniboss get stronger and worth more points. They take this idea and put it on a fancy display chart to give it immersion value but it does nothing. The heirarchy is actually quite meaningless and just provides for a small amount of immersion in an otherwise vaine attempt to add a grind/side quest element to the game to make it longer and promote a basic character level up which tries, but fails to make you care about the character.

If you love, love love BATMAN for its gameplay and not necessarily the story or that it takes place in the Gothom world and you love love love LOTR, you might like this game... it does have something to offer but it is unfortunately typical....unless you like mindless combat and button mashing --- which for that there are a few NES classics you can play for free.

I was really able to get into this game for about 45 mins... then it just wasn't as enjoyable as it should be. If you are on the fence... wait a while for the price to drop to someting more reasonable."

The nemesis system (Sauron's army) is neither a positive nor a negative for me, overall. It's negative that someone replaces one you've killed, makes me feel I'm never going to eliminate all. It's positive to have goals, killing your way through the ranks, though.

For me, it's just too grindy and repetitive. Maybe it's because I've played the Batman games a lot, which has a very similar combat system, but only just under three hours played and I'm bored of it.

After an admittedly short time with the game, I found myself confused and disappointed.  After some introductory cinematics spent a token amount of time vaguely establishing the Ranger's tragic backstory and a few brief combat tutorials, I find myself controlling a wraith elf on top of a tower, who reforged a sword that he recognised on a ghostly anvil, to open a map area and then jump down off the tower to kill some Uruks as a not-dead Ranger.  I honestly thought I'd managed to skip some cutscenes or further tutorials, because I just felt totally disconnected from the whole experience.

Lacking any context, I decided to look at some of the menus instead and within minutes I'd been bombarded with objectives, statistics, maps, icons, weapon upgrade trees, runes and absolutely no context whatseover.  Why is the Ranger suddenly now in Mordor?  Why doesn't he seem particularly surprised to suddenly have possession of a ghostly bow?  Why did he send his son to find his wife, only to then apparently find her himself?  Was the voice-over in a loading screen meant to fill in some of the blanks?  Because if so, it got cut off mid-sentence and I don't know what I was meant to take away from that either.

Tolkien's world has one of the most rich backgrounds ever created, so to choose not to spend time building an involving story and framing narrative for all of this seems really short-sighted.  It just felt like I'd picked up a friend's copy of the game with a save file at 75% and no idea what to do next.  I don't need a game to hand-hold to a ridiculous extent, but a gradual exposure to the core game mechanics really would have gone a long way to make the game seem more accessible.  As it stands, the game just didn't engage me at all and I felt let-down by the brief time that I spent with it.  The Arkham games have a natural progression to them and introduce game concepts gradually; taking the time to develop characters and give clear objectives.  This game doesn't do any of that, from what I can tell.

If this is one of the better open-world games to grace the market, then I will be steering well clear of them from now on."

The following 23.5 hours were a constant stream of the same experience ad nauseum all the way up to the point halfway through where the game promised to continue the same experience in a marginally new location.

Also, the story.  You play an emotional man, butthurt because you were 'cursed' with being the deadliest thing in all of middle earth, and immortal.   Seriously, I absolutely can find no connection with why the main character wants to undo this rather than use it to help people and solve everyones problem as he's the deadliest thing on the planet, already in Mordor, and immortal with what appears to be no feeling of pain or injury.  

The game does do one thing well, which is fighting/kill sequences and animations.  That said, from beginning to end with no breaks, that will be all you ever do in this game.

2674,2,0.3681,"control, button, bad, want, time, press, right, ever, shit, click","I usually stay away from film franchise games, because they've been 99% bad ever since the eighties, and I have mixed feelings about this one, too. While the story is interesting, the acting and gameplay make it less so.

The controls are awful. In a PC game I'd prefer a limited number of context-sensitive controls rather than 20 or so action keys and some additional combinations impossible to remember in the heat of battle – not to mention reach comfortably. For example, why the separate keys for combat drain and a regular drain? It would make no sense to do the slower one, when a faster one is available. On the other hand, the regular drain key doubles as the key for ""drop down"", which makes draining on a ledge quite impossible. It'd be almost funny if it didn't mean yet another stupid death. The menus don't even adhere to the key mappings, and there's no consistency, which is a little confusing. Even worse, the interrogation key does not actually get remapped, so (after a lot of cursing and googling) I realized I had to press space instead, despite what the game instructed. Also, the game uses a peculiar hard-coded Ctrl+Enter combo to switch to windowed mode, but the problem is that I use those for controls. Sigh. I'm lucky to own a remappable gaming keypad, as this game could well be unplayable for non-WASD gamers. That's bad programming and lack of QA.

Even when/if you get the hang of the keys, controlling the player character is not always smooth. For example, he often gets stuck running against an orc, pole, rock or tree, all of which could be easily moved past. Sometimes he inexplicably fails to climb an object or wall, and other times he is too eager to climb, causing many unfair deaths and failures.

The graphics settings didn't have the native 1440p resolution of my monitor as an option. The game seemed to think it is 1080p, which looked terrible. I selected a bigger, weird resolution, which looked OK but nearly halved the FPS. Better slow than ugly, though. Weirdly 1440p appeared in the menu later on. Unfortunately most of Mordor looks dull, small and copy-pasted, but at least characters look OK, and they're animated realistically. Fortunately the sceneries get a little prettier as the game progresses, but they still don't look as good as other modern games.

At first I was lost in the game world, not knowing what to do and how to fight, with the minimap showing weird symbols, which turned out to be plants, while useful stuff like mission objectives and grog are not marked, so it's hard to plan routes. The game explains new moves etc. as they're unlocked, but a tutorial sure would be nicer. There are some very annoying (random?) balancing problems such as more and more bosses appearing with dozens of henchmen, while you're busy trying to take another one down. If that weren't bad enough, some combat moves require reflexes way beyond a casual gamer. A ghul matron took me down many, many times, as I was looking for the correct keys to trigger special abilities while trying to avoid her counter-attacks and dozens of her offspring. The fights soon get frustratingly repetitive, especially if you lose often. To make it worse, opponents get more powerful with every death.

The music is unmemorable, and sound effects feel like they have too little variation. Gollum's ramblings were fun, but other voice acting lacks atmosphere. The orcs sound more like bad comedians than monsters, although there is delightfully much variation in their lines.

How on earth did this game score 4/5 in many reviews? With all the problems and repetitive gameplay I'd give it 2. Unless you're a hardcore LotR fan, I'd suggest to try before buying."

- Extremely boring game loop: Kill the same Orks over and over and over and over.
- ""Pinball-Combat-System"". 
- Orks re-spawn right behind / in front of you, the moment after you have killed them.
- Interactive movie (If you want that, better watch the original movies).
- Boring and closed world with lots re-used assets / textures. You'll see a ""You are leaving the mission area""-warning very often.
- Repetitive grinding and unattractive perk system.
- Unoptimised PC port with console graphics that needs a lot horse power to run. Played on Ultra-Settings with HD texture pack. 

[b]Overall:[/b]
As a fan of the movies, I had to buy the game. Soon I realised that I had been tricked into this by dark forces. 
If you like boring combat within a boring game world that (mis)uses an awesome movie license it's ok. 

For me: Sorry, not worth a buy! This is not the AAA-game I was looking for."

The main problem in this game is that it amounts to literally nothing, you can work as hard as you want to unlock everything, but it won't mean anything as its one of the most ""cut to black"" endings I've ever seen. Most of the game is spent hyping up the climax, but then it never delivers and that left me feeling exhausted and infuriated. Overall I would not recommend as it feels like a vanilla open world chore, even though I have a huge love for LOTR and all its lore, this is a thumbs down for me."

They make you sneak but dont give you actual sneaking means, its basicaly, kill to not be seen. 

Extremly dull combat, 2 button win everything style. Wanted to like, couldnt play long enough to find out more, which is a bummer.

Graphics look already dated compared to the competition.

2681,3,0.3206,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This is perhaps one of the most dullest game I have played in years.

Graphics: 3/5
- Decent at best
- Models are okay
- Animations are good
- Its unoptimized as hell. Even with a good machine you will run into random points of going from 60fps to all the way down to 20 randomly.

Gameplay: 1/5
- One of the most dullest combat i've ever played in years. When the game actively tries to discourage you from slaughtering hundreds of orcs by only giving you 1exp for each kill it a gigantic red flag. Why would they do that you may ask? Because you can literally go through all of the fights with one hand via mashing attack and counter buttons. Depending on your mouse, you can literally do it with one finger. I can literally go to a stronghold and mash attack and counter without looking at the screen and have no tension whatsoever. Its easier than Assassin Creed games.
- Stealth is nonexistent. You only have to be 2 feet away inorder for the orcs to notice you and you can still assassinate them even after they spotted you within a couple of seconds. 
- Nemesis system loosk promising and is a neat concept. 

Story: N/A
- Cant really have an opinion because I didnt play all the way through. I've actually requested my first refund ever for this game. When the gameplay is so bad that I have no reason or motivation to progress the story.

Sound: 3/5
- Its alright. Nothing special or spectacular. 
- Voice acting is good


TL:DR
This is a poorman's Assassin Creed with Lord of the Rings skin. It has one of the worst combat i've ever experienced in years that I wouldnt even suggest buying this game on sale. There's also no reason why this game is 40+gb big as not even my heavily modded Skyrim takes this much space up. The fact that this game got the Action Game of the Year award over Bayonetta 2 is absolutely sad.

Instead, try and play these similar games.
Assassins Creed, Skyrim, Devil May Cry 4, Dark Souls 1 and 2 including their expansions."

2689,4,0.4781,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","After finishing the story I just can't recommend this game. It has some good stuff in it, but that just doesn't fix the huge amount of mistakes that were made.

Here is a simple Pros and Cons list

+Stealth is fun. Sneaking around, taking out Uruks at just the right times.

+The captain system is amazing. The way it works is that you can discover who the captains are by fighting them, or getting intel. You can then fight them and each is basically a mini-boss. Figure out the best way to attack him and take him down. Captains can come back for revenge and later on you can even turn them against each other.

+The game runs pretty good. I have a mid range machine and at the lowest settings I'm able to run most areas pretty well

-Stealth is annoying. I know I just said it's fun, but there's one, huge problem with it. Honestly I have no idea how anyone thought this was a good idea. You have to hold down the stealth key. This may not sound like much, till you realize that if you want to try and stealth the mission (and it's REALLY hard to do other wise). Imagine having to hold down one key for 30 min straight. I often had to just pause the game and take a breather because I kept getting cramps.

-Combat is a joke. If you want to just straight up fight then good luck. Ururks from all over will come over to fight, meaning a 3 man fight can turn into a 20 man fight quickly. You also CAN'T openly fight in a fortress. Other wise a Uruk will sound the alarm and now you got 30 dudes all attacking you. There's also not nearly enough time to counter. Unless you are all ready use to the combat system you will die. A lot.

-Boss fights=Shit. The boss fights are where this game fails the most. The bosses of the game are called the Black captains. Three dudes who serve the Dark Lord and who killed your family. The first one is mildly interesting. You have to dodge incoming attacks while delivering your own. The problem is you have about 0.00003 seconds to dodge the attacks. Plus the boss will often stun lock you. If that happens then your dead. The second is shorter. You have 8 min to try and stealth drain the boss and kill him. If he spots you then he does a bunch of damage and teleports away. The problem with this one is how easy it is. Just go to the highest spot and jump down on him. You also only need to get him a few times and then you win. Super short.

I'm going to give the last boss fight it's own paragraph because it's the biggest fail I have ever seen in any video game ever. For the last fight you have to push through a battle that's happening between your Uruks and other Uruks. You then meet the Black Talons (at least I think that was their names. I've already forgotten), the personal bodyguards of the Black Hand, your family's murderer. The thing is, you get a massive force of captains and Uruks to fight them. You basically can just sit back and do nothing. Once they are dead you can go and fight the black hand. The fight is a joke. It lasts all of 30 seconds and is little more than a glorified cut scene. This is the last FUCKING BOSS OF THE GAME. THIS IS LAZY GAME MAKING!!!! *sigh* The entire fight is just quick time events. Press and hold this button, move the mouse here and press this button. Really really easy and really really short. It's just insulting that they made all of this story and then take a massive dump on it at the end.

If you can get the game on sale great. Other wise it's not worth it

TL;DR version

Stealth is fun and bad
Great captain system. Make enemy's and armies!
Runs great
Bad combat unless you're used to it
Boss fights are the worse thing I have ever seen in a game"

2691,3,0.5367,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","//contains minor narrative spoiler//

Incredibly boring and incredibly easy, i tried to like this game, i really did, but there's just very little there to like.

Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor shows you everything you need to know about the game in order to beat it within the first hour of playtime. The combat is like that found in many games of today, simple attack, counter and dodge semi-qte combat that becomes mindnumbingly boring after a while. There are abilities to unlock, sure, but none of them are actually necessary to progress through the game, or win the grand majority of fights in it. 

A pet-peeve of mine is that ground finishers are either only useful in small fights or when a big one is nearing its end, even with the ability that speeds them up they just don't fit into the pacing of the combat and always end up getting interupted by an enemy trying to hit you.

All the activities in the game derive from the very simplistic combat, its made even more simple in these activities by giving the player a goal like, kill 10 uruk with headshots in 2 minutes. The thing is, you'll have been doing this before you entered the activity, and you'll be doing it a whole lot after, especially the bow challenges are all incredibly easy thanks to the slow motion that kicks in once you start aiming, so it's not exciting at all, it's a boring chore, a chunk of the regular gameplay, repackaged as something else when you're really just doing the same thing you were before. Why aren't there any activities that actually bring some variation into the mix or any that don't involve the combat? I don't know but it bothers me. They could've even involved catagor races between competing captains and warchiefs, where the player would play as ratbag.

The nemesis system doesn't really amount to much, if anything it's either a nuissance or just useless. If the player dies, he is punished by increased difficulty and if the player wins, he is rewarded with no increase in difficulty. Obviously that's the opposite of what it should've been, as lesser skilled players will get locked in by the game and skilled players will be met with boredom from the lack of challenge. Killing captains and warchiefs gains the player power, which is needed for unlocking abilities, these abilities are locked behind three or four thresholds you need to reach before you can unlock them, but again, they aren't actually necessary. Aside from that, the only reason i've found to make use of the branding system was because it was necessary for story progression, setting up uruk like pawns might be fun for a little bit, in and of itself, but without necessity it again becomes useless when i can just go straight for the warchief and take him out, without all the fuss of branding his bodyguards.

The story is simplistic, and servicable at best, voice acting is mostly good, the most memorable character is ratbag and he gets killed off halfway through.

Aside from the things stated above i just feel Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is an incredibly boring, monotonous game. somewhat graphically pleasing, much less artistically so. The maps also happen to be absolutely tiny, whilst riding a catagor one could go from one side to the other in under a minute or two. I wouldn't reccommend buying this at full price, or any price for that matter."
2692,2,0.3907,"control, button, bad, want, time, press, right, ever, shit, click","I really tried to play this game. I love the idea, the stealth, the story, but fuck the shit camera. How can I play a game if a quarter of the screen is always obscured? I am constantly swinging at shit I didn't even know was there because of how far the camera is always zoomed in. So damn disappointed."
2693,3,0.3432,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Game is a AC clone with lord of the rings lore slapped on it, you have to keep killing an enemy to progress the story line and some of these enemies don't stay dead, the spacebar dodge mechanic in this game is a mere distraction. God forbid you run into a uruk with a shield AND a helmet, Rage simulation at its best. 

(I don't care if the review gets blasted out of the water at this point. If you're reading this you probably haven't bought the game yet. Buy it on sale, i payed 50 for everything DLC included and i still hate myself for going over 2 hours only to get hit by the massive amount of repetition.)

10/10 would love getting called Sharkh and having 20 Captains introduce themselves for 10 minutes before the fight actually starts again. 

P.S have a benny hill theme youtube tab open, you're going to need it when the game decides to make uruks run faster then Usain."
2694,3,0.5681,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","The graphics are amazing and the game looks beautiful.

But I didn't like the gameplay itself. The controls feel clunky, And if you die, the death scene is long and drawn out. And after playing the game for a couple of hours I still haven't found a way to save the game. I'm not even sure that it can be saved.

So when I had to restart my computer I lost all my progress and had to work through all the cutscenes and tutorial stuff again.

Also, the character feels underpowered. Basically, you are in an arena with dozens of enemies, including a handful of boss characters. They cluster around each other and mob you, and you can't really do much.

Being bogged down in a the arena, while being killed continuously by the same characters, and having the death scenes drawn out made the beautiful graphics boring.

My main gripe with this game is the jerkiness of control, which can make for some frustrating moments. Not to mention that there are time-based requirements for achievements which I find to be irritating for the arbitrary limit. 

I did kinda like some of the characters introduced, though the dialogue generally could use some work to improve Talion's conversational skills such that he can string more than two sentences together at a time.

Disclaimer: I'm getting frustrated with one of this game's achievements that requires a great deal of luck with captain/warchief spawns combined with an arbitrary time-limit.

Having said all that, if you're in this a slash-'em-up, it's probably worth getting on sale at some point just for the experience of the game."
2699,0,0.4467,"buy, money, work, run, pc, fix, still, say, try, start","This is a tough review to write. Originally, I wrote a glowing review of this game praising the game mechanics and graphical fidelity. Now, I'm going to have to revise my review. Yes, the gameplay still rocks, and so do the graphics. I love Monolith and the Lord of the Rings, my beef isn't with them. However, the graphic violence, and more importantly, the crappy morality of this game has turned me off from it forever. It all started when I was browsing some Shadow of Mordor forums online, and came across a thread about how to kill bosses. I was reading the comments, and people were going all out talking about their best boss kills. Any game has these type of threads, but normally they say stuff about tactics. This one was about how to get to your nemesis and murder them ""whilst they are screaming for mercy."" The way this post was written really chilled my blood (and the person who was writing it came across like a psychopath) but then I realized, the people who were playing the game this way were playing it the way it was meant to be played. I'm not going to mince words here: this game condones torture, subjugation of inferior races, and revenge without mercy. There is an option to ""brutalize"" your enemy, which is where you murder them so savagely that all their friends run in fear, and you're encouraged to kill the others while they are fleeing. This type of violence without mercy is not true to the core mythology of LOTR, and is definitely not something I think I should be playing. Now: don't get me wrong here. I'm not a prude, and I can handle videogame violence. I'm not some anti-M rating conservative parent, and in fact I'm currently enjoying Tomb Raider, The Witcher 2, and the Arkham series. However, the encouragement of torture and the fetishization of graphic violence in this game is simply not something I can recommend, much less take part in.


Edit like 7 years later -- I've recently come back to this game, and I think my original review stands. The Nemesis system aged really well, and the main story is literally worthless. Also, it's still really pointlessly violent and out of place in the Tolkien canon."

If you dont like the spoiling of your story (Or lak there of) then dont read the rest.


But what really got me is not just that the story is REALLY REALLY short and there is only 20 missions but when you have your so called army you get to fight the Evil villian number 2 and his grate army with 20 Urks and you only bring your 5 war cheifs and steam roll over all of them....

They would all spawn in, one after another in 4 second intervals, no matter where I was on the map, no matter what mission I was on. I wasn't able to complete jack because of getting gangbanged every 3 minutes in the game. Normal mobs were a breeze and I would kill them by the dozens at once, and one or maybe two captains at a time would be fine...but seriously, 15 named captains at once?!?! I guess due to the Nemesis system if you die even once you might as well just start the game over otherwise you experience what I did. Screw the Nemesis system!

If this is Game of the Year it must have been a dull year. I will buy the sequel though, because I think the developers have probably got some more they can do for us. And there will be a sequel. It's Warner Brothers, they'd do a sequel to their grandmother's funeral if it was popular enough."

For me the game itself is not really much of a game. Your basic objective is to go around a kill all the baddies, there is a semblance of a plot and story but it is not really front and center as it plays second fiddle to killing as many baddies as you can. I have no idea where I am in the story line and just wander around doing quests trying to enjoy myself with very little likelihood of that occurring.

Most the heralded features of the game, such as the nemesis system, add little and seem rather pointless. Those that are in to these sort of games will undoubtedly get more out of it and appreciate the subtler elements of the fighting, ignore the lack clearly defined plotlines and revel in the revenge and general killing spree. 
However, for me, coming from an Oblivion/Fallout/Mass Effect background this game has a muddled narrative and offers little of interest and enjoyment.

If you are in to fighting games with elements of RPGs you will probably love this game, if you are in to RPGs with story led game play and elements of fighting you may be disappointed."

The free running is good but there is far fewer objects to take advantage of it. The Uruks vision is terrible, even at night when they should be able to see better so you can stealth kill them even in combat sometimes. That is how I completed a story mission wherein you have to kill your first warchief, I baited in some caragors, made him enraged, and then stabbed him in the back three times whilst we were surrounded in enemies. 

The worst part, the absolute worst parts of the game, clipping through walls. I have done it over a dozen times in my 10 hours of playing it, almost always during a mission, forcing me to restart because I cannot get out. The first time it happened whilst sliding down a rope towards an archer tower, I thought it was a clever trap set up since there was a carpet on the floor and the archer was sticking to the edge of the building and not moving. After restarting I watched the archer again and saw him walk on top of it, ""Awesome! Procedurally generated traps?"", wrong. I shot the Uruk and slid down the rope, clipping through the floor and into it yet again.

Buggy, less entertaining free running than Assassins Creed, small gaming world, and you don't even get to brainwash the Uruks until the story missions are nearly complete. Waste of money, buy some other free running action game."

2715,3,0.4276,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","[b][i]TL;DR : This is a story-driven open-world RPG in which you kill never-ending swarms of orcs and wild beasts (with Arkham-esque combo-based combat mechanics) in order to level-up your character and upgrade your weapons; culminating in the ability to brand/possess orc captains to fight with you in a hugely underwhelming endgame.  Graphically beautiful, mechanically fun, narratively vapid.  Would recommend to those wanting to get lost in another world, would not recommend to fans of Tolkein lore or to players to whom story is a primary source of enjoyment.[/i][/b]


Shadow of Mordor is, effectively, split into two sections:


[b]World 1: Pre-Branding [/b]
--------------------------------------------------
The first half of the game is spent learning the game mechanics in a largely laissez-faire style - you are taught the basic controls in a bare-bones tutorial and then dropped into the open world to fend for yourself.  

Combat is based around left-click-to-attack, right-click-to-block (when you are promted a-la QTE), and the occasional 'E' or 'F' to activate a special move.  No targetting is required as you will auto-lock onto the nearest enemy, although this can be guided by shifting the camera with the mouse in the direction you'd like to travel.  You are nearly always fighting hordes of enemies (that may, in fact, never end - depending on your location), so it's a matter of juggling your enemies until you have an opening to activate a special-move rather than one-at-a-time combat that players may be used to in RPGs.  There are many different enemy types - unveiled as the game progresses - which can make the combat experience challenging after a certain level until crowd-control abilities are unlocked.

Stealth is handled by holding shift and, as long as you are not in direct line-of-sight will usually render you practically invisible to the enemy AI in a manner than would make even fans of Skyrim laugh out loud.  Because stealth has no side-effects on speed, you will find yourself using it [i]all the time[/i] when not in direct combat.  This does, however, make stealthing around a crowded orc stronghold incredibly fun while using the free-running and climbing mechanics that are straight out of Assassin's Creed.

Aside from the run-of-the-mill orc types, there are also orc 'captains' who have their own personalities, strengths and weaknesses for you to exploit; dropping 'runes' upon death which can be applied to your weapons for various stat-based improvements.  The quality of these runes is dependent on the level of the dead captain, who independently increase in level based on their own missions viewable on the world-map; duelling other captains, successfuly recruiting more orcs to their banner, hunting beasts, or even killing YOU.  You can help or hinder these captains according to whether you want better runes, or more XP, that is - until the second half of the game...


[b]World 2: Branding[/b]
--------------------------------------------------
In the second half of the game, you unlock an ability called 'branding', which allows you to possess orcs and weakened orc captains to follow your orders and fight on your behalf; allowing you to build your own army with which to take down other captains and, ultimately, take into the final battle with you.  This is when the strengths and weaknesses of the captains becomes something other than different ways for you to take them down - as you can build your orc army with the a build that you want.


--------------------------------------------------
[b]WARNING: NARRATIVE SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON![/b]
--------------------------------------------------
The story for this game is the tale of a man's vengeance when his family get fridged; vaguely shoved into Tolkein lore in the time between [i]The Hobbit[/i] and [i]The Fellowship of the Ring[/i] - with which the game shows very little respect at all - and creates a narrative that is counter to established lore.  

Aside from your dead wife, there are two other female characters in the game; a queen-sage who serves to give you missions during cutscenes, and her warrior daughter who never actually does any fighting and mostly serves as a quasi-love-interest to be rescued - although her personality is suitably warrior-like for this not to be too much of a cringeworthy annoyance.  This character can also be used as an alternative skin for the player, although voice-acting, environmental reactions (orcs misgendering) and cutscenes all revert back to the male character, so the skin is purely cosmetic.


[b]Conclusion[/b]
--------------------------------------------------
This game is a great way to get immersed in another world where you will always be outnumbered and fighting the good fight.  Mechanically it's fun (although you don't feel like you're a skillful player as much as one who's spent a lot of experience points unlocking abilities), graphically the world is absolutely beautiful (although VERY resource-intensive - particularly in world 2), but the game spends many, MANY hours building up to a conclusion that is extremely disappointing and renders all of your work unnecessary.  

In the final mission, my orc army did not land a blow on the enemy due to the fact that I had already dispatched of them via bow before they arrived, and neither of the final two bosses can actualy be fought - but are both conquered through  quick-time-events and cutscenes leaving the player disempowered, bored, and occasionally pressing 'E' while a pre-rendered cutscene fights on your behalf.  All of the player's fancy planning and skill-mastery can be entirely negated by unlocking more arrows and a special ability with the bow, and even these skills aren't used  when all you're doing is responding to on-screen prompts.

All-in-all, an extremely disappointing conclusion to an otherwise fairly enjoyable game-world, but as a game that really shoves narrative down your throat in an attempt to get you invested, I found the lacklustre ending too much of a switch-and-bait to consider recommending this game to anyone who wants to do anything other than feel like a god fighting an endless horde of orcs."
2716,1,0.3747,"open, computer, video, bug, close, buck, hate, damn, error, patch","The game crashes constantly. 

Which is a shame because I originally had this on PS4, on gamefly, and intended to own it. So when I bought it on Steam I was very excited.  SoM is an oustanding game, but when it crashes it takes my entire computer down to a black unresponsive screen, and forces me to restart. And its a russian roulette on if it will work the next time or not.

It's very well done in terms of graphics, sound and story relevance, but ...

What kills the game for me is the non-persistent nature of your actions, for instance, you clean up an area turn around walks 30 seconds in a given direction and then go back to the same area, it's like the world was reseted, all the enemies are back with their normal lives, all the bodies are gone, it's like you have never been there. This totally breaks the immersion for me because you seem to leave not a sign in the world unless you do the main quests,  what is the point of killing an entire army including the Captains and Warchiefs if they always come back or are replaced?"

Reading online others have experienced the same thing, sometimes from alt-tabbing but also at random simply by changing settings or exiting the game correctly in every way.  Its a crapshoot.  

If you can get past that and the usual failings of limited sight cones for enemies, it is a really great 1v100 enemies kill em all game.  The finishers are bloody, orcs losing heads, giant monsters to kill and ride.  Even before getting the full skill tree its quite fun just don't get too invested in it."

Why the thumbs down? Far too many parts were rushed at the end, simply slapped together to meet a deadline. The story? Excellent. Until every plot gets abruptly and crudely cut short. A main character gets slaughtered, and your character hardly bats an eye. The boss fights? You meet the first, halfway through the game. The second to last is met right at the end, and is frankly a cakewalk with no challenge. The last boss, the ultimate baddie, the guy you've been after all this time... is beaten with a Quicktime event, that requires the pressing of five buttons displayed on screen. The scenery? Beautifully breathtaking... until you discover all the locations look EXACTLY the same. The side quests? Fun... but rewarded with ""legendary"" weapon skin changes. Narsil's legendary blade gets replaced with an irish dirk. And that's it. No effect on the real world, no added abilities...

The bad:
-Lots of the same repetitive quests that are chores more than fun.
-Same horrible controls as most popular adventure games like assasins creed.  
-Due to making the game for console the game infers where you want to move and aim, often not going in the direction you moving/aiming the movement and shooting curves to ""make it easier"" on the players since they are using controllers.  This very frustrating if playing with an actual keyboard and mouse where you have pin point accuracy.

The Good:
- Story is actually fairly good considering everything else
- System requirements are fairly relaxed, and i get over 200 FPS with an older computer.
- World looks very good
- Other than the control issue mentioned above the game is very polish.  I have yet to run into any bugs or issues.
- Game you can ""turn your brain off"" for and just mash buttons if you choose to, but does offer other tactics if you want

2725,3,0.4376,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","While the game's Batman: Arkham-esque combat flows nicely at first, it quickly becomes cluttered with ridiculous numbers of enemies, many of which require different methods to stun. This would be fine if it weren't for the fact that the game fails to register me pressing the the jump button to vault over their head, or will misregister one of my finishers. I have tried the contoller I was using with a variety of my computers USB ports, and have not had this problem with any other game, but it's possible that won't be an issue for others. Running away is usually a valid option, but often it is a requirement of a side-mission to defeat a swarm of dozens of enemies in an enclosed space, or in order to kill a captain or warchief it is sometimes essential to do so in combat since they are immune to stealth and ranged.

The worst problem is also one of the games major features, that being the power struggle. While it certainly is interesting to see different enemies grow, and having to actually learn their weaknesses and plan out an attack is a great game feature, you are subjected to an annoying cutscene of an enemy mocking you before an update on how the power is moving every time you die before being reset on the map. This does give an interesting take on an incentive not to die, but the game is made infuriating by how badly this breaks the flow of combat before having to trek all the way back to whatever mission you just failed to try again, risking being killed again on the way. Besides this, I found I really didn't care at all about any of the captains that gained or lost power dependent on this system.

As for the plot, it is rather disappointing. All the main characters are bland and unbelievable, and the characters from the stories seem to be forced into the plot simply for brand recognition. I usually find the best element of Tolkien stories is the exploration of the world and the sense of scale, but in this almost all of the map looks like the same dark, gritty fantasy backdrop that's been used a thousand times before, and the exploration of its backstory seems rather insubstantial and confusing.

If you are a big fan of the Tolkien universe and liked the Batman: Arkham combat system, then you could do a lot worse than this, there are very few bugs and there is certainly a fair bit of challenge and thought that goes into the fights. I also think it was a valiant effort to mix up a few established gameplay styles in an established universe, but the variety of small aggravating problems have made the game an incredibly frustrating experience. If you think you can get past those issues, then I would advise picking it up on sale as I don't think it's worth more than about £20."

I didn't even bother to read the requirements. I mean why would I? I have an FX-9590, 16GB of ram, and an R9 Fury. Generally when you have a $550 graphics card you don't read the requirements because you expect to be able to run it. So I launch the game and am greeted with: ""AMD graphics cards are not currently supported by Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor.

If you wish to play the game using an AMD graphics card, you should update your graphics driver to AMD Catalyst version 15.7 or higher. You should be able to run the game without experiencing stability issues or graphical glitches, but you may still experience poor performance.""

I thought ""that's weird"" but clicked the continue button and the game opened to a loading screen. At which point it crashed. So I restarted my computer and tried again but to no avail. I should mention at this point I am running the 15.7 drivers. I understand AMD cards are not supported and so this is somewhat unfair but I can't find a good reason for them not to support AMD cards. Intel fine they probably couldn't run the game, it's too demanding. Yes I know AMD has really bad Linux drivers but every other game I own works fine on Linux. Is performance great, no because of bad drivers but I somewhat make up for it by having a stupid overpowered card for 1080p and at least I can turn down the settings and run it. Bioshock infinite runs at a nice 100+ FPS for me on ultra at 1080p with dips to 40. There's no reason why they couldn't have supported AMD. Other Devs do it. You don't hear the Unreal Engine team saying ""No AMD on Linux because of bad drivers."" They do it anyway and if you're an AMD Linux user you expect to have mediocre quality because of the poor drivers but you still expect to be able to run the damn game. Or assuming the game is just too demanding for the drivers ineficiency at least get into the damn menu. Phoronix did better than I did. They made it into the game but with ridiculous artifcating. I honestly feel like this is just laziness on the side of the developer. There's no good reason for this. It's just laziness and the fact that it's an nVidia title to start with. I understand AMD has bad drivers but other devs don't seem to have a problem with it. I will probably end up refunding the game because of this and even if they do begin to support AMD I probably won't repurchase the game. It was on sale for 50% off. It'll probably just sit on my wishlist for all eternity if I even have the respect for the developers to put it there. If nothing else change the requirements to simply say they aren't supported. Telling us that if we use the 15.7 drivers everything will run fine but with low FPS is bullshit when it quite frankly won't run at all."

Story is simply boring and cliche, moreover it's not within the spirit of LOTR books or movies. It has revenge driven hero who's absolutely dull and says nothing interesting through the whole game. 
Nemesis system at first glance is very interesting, but in short time becomes a great problem. Yes, the orcs are different, promote when they kill you and it's more or less engaging, but when you realize that it never ends it's no fun anymore. New orcs replace dead ones and you can fight with them whole eternity. The same problem is about wandering through the map. Mordor is very small and cramped and overcrowded with opponents who's respawning all the time. It's no pleasure when you cannot find peace anywhere on the map and you are forced to fight or run straight and try to escape from next and next hordes of enemies. 
Fight is simply mashing buttons but when it's taking to long, orcs are gathering quickly and you're outnumbered and powerless. Then you die and some random orc is promoting forthwith. As I said it's very frustrating and repetitive. 
Next great problem is camera which is uneasy to operate and during the fights is to close to our hero. Because of this we cannot see all enemies and sometimes we don't even now that we could block some attack from behind. 
Graphics are mediocre and it's the same with the sound. 
If this game would provide compelling story and develop Nemesis system into something bigger than never-ending orcs replacement and rotation, it could be just good one, but it's not satisfying at all and essentially is a very small game with no interesting content."

Cons:
- Awful and cliched story
- Extremely Repetitive
- No depth in gameplay


I finished the game in around 23hours, and it was without a doubt one of the most uninteresting games I have ever played. The first two hours showcases 80% of what the rest of the game will be like. You can find more depth in a MMO Starting zone than in this entire game. 

The story it self is another level of awful; The main story is about as cliched and unoriginal as you could get and 80% of the characters you meet feel like they have been shoe horned into the main story. It was almost like they just took a template and asked ""how can we make this middle-earthy"". 

Without a doubt one of the most overrated games over the last few years. Save yourself the trouble and take a pass on this one."

The heiarchy system was well put together and introduced an interesting element to the game that improved its replayability.  Unfortunately, the story and character development was pretty rudimentary and I couldnt get into it.  Being a middle earth game, it didnt have much of anything to do with actual canon.  I would recommend this game had the combat been an improvement over previous Batman games, but it was simpler than those games and also lacked the content Batman games boasted.  While perhaps better than some other games I've recommended, the effort put into this game by a major company at its price point deserves a ""no""."
2750,3,0.4412,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I have mixed feelings about Shadow of Mordor. The initial start of the game is very challenging, until you realise that the story missions are still tutorials and you shouldn't embrace the open world until you've had a chance to go through several of them. Despite a lot of tutorial, the game really doesn't explain what it is you're supposed to do - it is very easy to find yourself in missions where typical open-world gameplay has been taken away but you don't get any hints until you fail it. Thereafter, the game varies in difficulty depending on the particular enemies and environment, but generally becomes much easier as you increase in power.

It can be a blast, as you wander through the open world, killing orcs, riding caragors, and generally making life difficult for the denizens of Mordor. It can be incredibly frustrating, fighting controls and yelling for the player character to not do something incredibly stupid. The UI in particular suffers from 'one button does everything' and you can easily find yourself failing missions or getting detected simply because the game gets locked into certain modes and refuses to let you move. I think I was frustrated the most by the game's clunky controls because on the few occasions where everything worked, the game had huge potential and the combat was a delight to behold.

In a lot of ways you might as well be playing the Assassin's Creed series with LOTR textured over it; it plays identically from the character motions through to riding and interactions with the open world. The selling point, that of the nemesis system, never kicked in for me. The uruks either died or got branded; it was rare to die to them, and none of them really felt like actual enemies. Couple that with the same repetitive dialogue, the dull story that was hard to mesh with the established lore, and the endless trotting out of LOTR movie tropes (seriously, could someone engage a writer instead of just picking movie quotes?) and I found my engagement with the game bittersweet. I wanted more from it than it could provide even as it made me swear at it.

My biggest problem with the game really stems from the saved game bugs (and this is well after DLC and patches). After a good long playthrough, satisfied with my progress, the game indicating that I was almost finished, a crash caused the entire progress to be lost and more than a day of play vanished. When the entire selling point of the game is your own custom interpretation of an open world, and how you've fought & dominated the uruks within it, to be so careless with the saved game system is criminal."

Initially I had lots of expectations, especially when I saw the world around me, the opponents I was going to face and the way in which I could develop mij character. These expectations soon proved to be overrated. 
I will summarize the goods and bads:

Good:
- Entertaining combats 
- Great environment and care for detail

Bad: 
- Very thin storyline
- Combat soon becomes repetative 
- Either there is NO challenge in combat or way too much
- Extra's do nóthing for the game (gathering stuff costs a lot of time but adds zero to the experience) 
- You can choose to use a different skin/character-look, but during the game the voice of the character is nog changed (not even if you pick the female skin!) and in in-game cinematics the 'old' skin always appears. 
- Sorry for small spoiler: the ending of the game is a very very big anti-climax with an extremely easy and short fight against the main villain (wasn't that what the whole ""story"" was about!?) 
- There is an extra storyline that adds zero to the main story.
- The Lord of the Rings atmosphere is only there during cinematics (mentioning of Saruman, presence of Sauron and the rings of power), otherwise -besides the Uruk- there is nearly any affinity with the books or the movies (and that is something I hope most people feel is the very least you could expect from a game like this?). 
- Above all: killing captains and warchiefs does NOTHING since they are always replaced and after some time even with Uruks that have already been dealt with earlier on... 

Overall this game is worth a meager 6/10. Visually it is not disappointing and some gimmics are farely new and at first pleasant and entertaining(like the opponents remembering and mentioning an earlier fight which you lost). 
If I had known this in advance, I would not have purchased this game, but if it were either cheap or for free, my advice is: play ónly the storyline and finish the game in just a couple of hours."

2762,4,0.4866,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","I have a few major complaints:

1) The combat requires finishers for basically every enemy, which super sucks at the beginning of the game, and isn't really that fun to play (to me). Granted, after they go down about 2 or 3 times, you can finally kill tthem with your sword, but when there are 4-7 guys around you that won't die, and you only want to kill one, and he keeps calling reinforcements, it gets kinda dumb.

2) The movement system, while versatile, sucks compared to Assassin's Creed. It's basically the half of those games' movement system that Watch_Dogs [i]didn't[/i] get, and having only half a system really limits your abilities. As it is I don't know of a way to silently jump down a >1 meter gap quickly (without drawing attention), as holding E (or whatever) drops you to a hang, and you have to follow that with dropping again, which is slow.

3) Very little explaination is given in the game, be it combat gimmicks, how upgrades unlock, or how any of the missions affect anything within the game. Looking online, it appears the orange missions only really matter after a certain point in the game, yet you need to grind the orange & red missions to get to that point. There is no instruction on how to take down groups of enemies at all really, especially when they're surrounding a boss (which you can see is a crux of my problems)

4) The game also really puts a damper on adventure and experimentation as well, dying at any time in the field will make that Uruk a piece of Sauron's Army, and dying to/fleeing from a member of the Army will make that member stronger, so you haven't a lot of room to try and fail. Honestly, this problem alone is what causes me to quit the game every time I pick it up.

I don't like it, but if you enjoy the Arkham games' combat in an average open-world adventure game, this game is perfect for you."

Later on when you level up and put points into combo, you can finally kill an orc faster once you get 5x stacks. The problem with this is that there are 10 to 20 orcs sometimes, so I just leave them because it’s just too boring to deal with. At least with the batman game you can use baterangs, grappling hook, explosive gel etc… to make your battles more interesting.

2766,3,0.5497,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Shadow of Mordor...

I suppose I should start with the positives:
 - Combat is excellent, with visceral takedown animations and a particularly cool 'double parry' animation. Best non-Batman take on the Arkham combat formula I've played.
 - World building is great. Outposts are a genuine threat if you decide to be belligerent and attack in the open. The landmarks are large and rather imposing. Draw distance is good, with very few subpar textures visible at extreme distance (of the drawn objects, that is). Not a whole lot of pop in.
 - I really like the 'Wraith' and his voice. Especially his voice. I'm a voice person. Don't mind me.

However, there were a handful of things that I particularly did not like and went a great distance to colour my opinion of the game.
 - It starts slow. This is not a fault unto itself, but the fact that you cannot even obviously impact the main selling point of the game (ie influence uruk politics, have your own lackeys and agents and such) until you unlock it after several story missions and what is made out to be a fairly major arc really annoys me. Wouldn't normally, but given how bare bones the game is sometimes, it feels like a rather large omission.
 - Mission design completely screws with the game's tempo. You're the legendary Gravewalker, etc. You can take down hordes of uruk single-handedly... so I hope you like stealth missions. There are some awesome ones thrown in mind you (I really enjoyed taking down the warchiefs for the first time, and the subsequent showdown with the first true 'big bad'). I'm confident that there are great missions further on down the line... I'm just struggling to bring myself to make it there.

The thing, however, that prompted me to stop playing and write this review might seem to some people as trivial. The save system. It's a checkpoint system, yet I've seen zero indication of when my game has been saved. I'm sure the icon is there on screen somewhere, but I'm yet to have seen it. It's also great when you start a mission, enter an entirely new area of the map, screw up the end of the stupid stealth mission (seriously, I hate stealth), take the quit option it gives you while you calm down, and EXIT THE GAME... only to reboot and find yourself having to start the entire mission again, discovering the new area and all. What the hell? It's not helped by the fact that the mission in question is the equivalent of pullilng teeth, listening to Talion grumble on-and-on again about ghuls and such.

I feel that, if I can bring myself to pass that section then I will keep playing and ultimately enjoy myself when the pacing allows. For the now, it feels like  the developers had a conversation along the lines of ""less is more"" and tried to apply it to fun.

You might be more inclined to this than I. Play it for the combat and some cool lore. I don't actively recommend it."

Graphics may look nice but to be precise the scenery has a very low poly geometry (flat surface, no parallax, very edgy stones). Characters and combat have excellent animations.

Combat is as good as batman but very repetitive and well, you do that for the whole game so the skill tree and new powers don't make it any more interesting. The nemesis system was interesting at first, but after a while it becomes just as repetitive, with missions to grind on it nothing more.

Side missions are horrible. You see the first, you have seen them all, they are basically challenges with one completion requisite and one bonus objective to gain more xp. Free the slaves, infiltrate the camp, kill the orcs and so on.

The main story is quite short and it repeats itself as well. You do the same things and the poor design of the locations doesn't help doing the same things over and over.

I am very sad about this game, I expected it to be a great game. It is not that bad, but it's just not interesting enough. How the batman games managed the game map, main story, side story and challenges is absolutely on another level. This is just some weird LOTR action game without any real sauce in it.

""But that's what make the Arkham games cool!"" you might say. Yes. And that is exactly why this game falls short. It's a lifeless world with repeditive gameplay. Basically, you run around a bunch of bland flat terrain and stab orcs. Over, and over, and over again.

The whole captain system is amazing, as everyone makes note of. Each captain/warchief is different, with randomly generated names and appearance. It adds a really unique aspect to the game. However, very quickly you realize that this aspect of the game plays next to no relevant point. Pretty much all it means is that sometimes your battles will be harder.

As for the main story, the ENTIRE GAME feels like a tutorial. Seriously, you keep plugging away, knowing you'll get different abilities, knowing that you're being held back, but you have to keep going through the plotline to get these abilities. As for the plotline itself, it's absolutely terrible. The general idea is kind of neat, but all it is, is 20 (yes only 20) missions, where half the time you're doing completely irrelevant things. The characters are pretty forgettable. It's over very quickly. And the last two boss battles are an absolute joke (they're way too easy, and not gratifying).

I'd say it's worth it for a max of $10. As it is, I spent $35 getting a bundle of the game and all DLC, and I feel completely ripped off. I'm actually struggling to get the motivation to finish the DLCs, just because it's an uninteresting, bland, and repetitive game.

Edit: After getting 100% on this, I can say that it definitely is fun, but all of the above is still true. One thing that redeemed this a bit for me was the time trial aspect. It takes advantage of the open world aspect of the game, and gives you a challenge when the game starts feeling way too easy.

Nice graphics.  The Captains. The Nemesis and Branding systems have a lot of potential (but I got bored before I really got into them) 

Bad points:  Too much of an Assassin's Creed clone for my taste. Awful, awful save system with combo awful awful re-spawning of enemies after EVERY save (the number of times I killed that same orc archer in the scaffolding..!!!).
 ""Dead"" world, with minimal interaction with the environment. No conversation. Button-crunching, finger-deadening, repetitive combat or ""let's sneak again"" tedium..... 

Less than five hours, and I was bored and frustrated - even more so than with (the prettier) renaissance Assassin's Creed - with no desire to (yet again) retrace my steps from that shiny tower (killing the SAME orcs en-rout) just to get to where I had been last save...

With in 1 hour I had to fight a rank 20 orc that means everytime this crossbow orc appeared it would take 1 shot & you go down it literally ruins the experience, even if it doesn't kill you by the time you stand back up another orc has already started his next attack on you to take a chunk of health out of you which sometimes can't be blocked.

The AI in this game can be frustrating & the controls are just horrid, the stealth & cover system are completely broken.

Stealth/Cover/Sprint do not have a toggle switch (annoying) & jumping is automatic which makes it extremely frustrating

Blocking & Jumping over with random button sequence (annoying) why not just keep it simple & use 1 button

Jumping at the right times also feels broken as I've many encounters were it failed numerous of times it just felt buggy.

When using a mouse I had no idea what the visual was that it wanted me to click (left-click or right-click) 

All in all there is just way to much going on, things happening way too fast I couldn't keep up anymore

2790,3,0.6286,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I can't really recommend this game.
In short: A game with many elements copied from other games. One interesting mechanic which is unique, but will become boring quickly. Very few LotR elements. Not much story.

Many parts of the game are mediocre: 
- The story fails completely. It is very uninteresting even if you are into LotR.
- The characters are not very interesting. Most of all the guy(s) you are playing as.
- The main missions are too easy compared to side quests and casual fights against random Uruk captains.
- The Nemesis System is the highlight. It really works fine. However you will quickly feel fighting against windmills. (Maybe that's intended?)
- Most missions and enemies feel random. 80% of the missions have no story. Most missions will also give you no reward. There are hunting and gathering side-quests, which also have no story at all. Collecting invisible graffitti (""Ithildin"") doesn't get you anywhere and gives you no reward. Completing all sword, bow and dagger missions will give you a different looking sword and dagger (but not bow) and nothing else.
- The end boss fight consists of 3 or 4 quick time events and a lot of boring cutscenes. Fighting a level 20 warchief is 20 times more difficult than fighting your arch-enemy (the one who ""rules them all"")

Another word to the Nemesis System: The enemies are not created randomly. They are definitely pre-made. However they totally look random.


The parts which are good are all copied from other games:
- Sword Combat of Batman: Arkham, but you have less gadgets
- Bow Combat of Turok, Tomb Raider (2013) or any other game where you have a bow. But the Bullet Time makes it far too easy.
- Stealth is similar to Assassin's Creed, but feels stupid and unrealistic, because nobody notices your finishers, which are very loud. And every enemy is extremely short-sighted.
- Riding is similar to Assassin's Creed. However, riding a beast is something new. But the Graugs are ripoffs of the Rancors in Star Wars - The Force Unleashed. Riding a Caragor is funny, but riding a Graug is not, because you don't see whats in front of you and the World is simply too small for a Graug. It will always stop at invisible barriers.
- Capturing your mounts reminded me a little of Mercenaries 2 - World in Flames. But at some point you get a skill where you are able to mount a mount with one klick, which makes it a little boring.

By the way: Why not Trolls instead of Graugs and Wargs instead of Caragors? Or Mumakil?
The game is not very LotR. Gollum and Sauron are the only characters you know. You meet a dwarf that has no beard, but tattoos. Half of the ""Uruks"" look like normal Orks, but none looks like the Uruk-Hai from the LoTR movies.


All in all, this game is fun in the beginning, but becomes boring very quickly. You quickly advance in the skill tree. Tactics which were useful in the beginning will become more and more useless while new tactics will become standard. Also tactics which made no sense in the beginning become more useful in the end. 
Anyway, if you are half through the game, you will feel like you have seen everything."

2792,3,0.7224,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Easily one of the most boring games I've played. Don't get me wrong, though. Shadow of Mordor does something unique that I haven't seen in other games: the nemesis system. When someone kills you, they remember your actions and when you encounter them next time, they will mention it to you.

That's where the game stops in terms of being unique. It's similar to Ubisoft games where you go to point A, climb a tower and unlock an area. Then you go and do those tedious little quests where you have to kill a bunch of people and free X amount of slaves. Rinse and repeat. The story is told through cutscenes rather than actual gameplay which is an immersion breaker. I had a completely different skin while playing the game yet during the cutscene I look like a wuss.

The story isn't all too interesting. If you enjoy the Lord of the Rings, you will enjoy the story. For casual fans like myself, I couldn't find myself getting into it. The animations are very poor. Rather than fluid movements, everything feels choppy. It doesn't feel like I'm actually Talion.

In terms of difficulty; I would say this game is challenging enough. I found myself dying numerous times. Hats off to the devs for removing regenerative health. I hate that mechanic in modern games.

Of course, you have your skill tree and everything. I enjoy upgrading myself in-game, but the game itself is so stale that I couldn't play for more than an hour at a time. Personally, I'd find a game like Assassin's Creed more interesting than this because of its real-world historical concepts. In this game, it feels like I'm fighting a bunch of apes than humans. They don't feel like 'real' opponents. To me, anyways.

All in all, if you want something new, don't bother with this game. Although it has the innovative nemesis system, it still feels 'samey'. Feels like they put in the worst part of Assassin's Creed games and left out the fun parts. The game feels more like a chore than a game.

I guess I assumed in this game you would be performing tasks and missions to assist in the destruction of Mordor, such as leading troops through deadly areas and taking out small bands of orcs, but I was wrong. Apparently you run around in large open areas where crouching somehow makes half blind orcs not see you. You can then proceed to kill them in stealth by stabbing them with a dagger, or you may choose to use your sword in combat with them, which for some reason takes 20 hits (No, they are not challenging combatants they just take more hits like a wooden dummy, because swords apparently hurt less than daggers) but dont worry either way they will be right back, because death in this game means nothing. You die... Your back... A named orc dies... hes back..... A ""throw away guy"" dies... ohh wait hes back and as meaningless to kill as ever.  I do not think I have been this frustrated with a game in a very long time, not because it is a hard game, but because the game is so inconsistent that it becomes difficult and annoying.  Not counting the button mashing ""loud"" combat I found fighting very difficult when fighting groups. The mechanics of the combat system were very inconsistent, like for instance the action abilities, such as execution or drain , some you did and everyone watched and stood around, others you were clobbered in the back of the head while doing. It made no sense and often made combat a joke because it was incredibly hard to finish off an opponent.  Named orc  seemed to compound the problem and multiple named just made it a joke. One would be talking to you (for some reason I just sit and listen to him) while the other would be loading his bow and POW right when hes done chatting you get ""downed"". Horrible, horrible mechanics... And.. why give people abilities such as sneak attack or the ability to use a bow if your just going to bypass them? I was embarassed when I went to snipe a named and it gave me the message ""immune to ranged"" . Is that honestly the best way to deal with that? Immune to Sneak attack... Why?? Why give people abilites if your just going to bypass them? Save yourself years on your life and don't play this game"

The map is very small, I thought it would take me 10 minutes to travel to another city, nope, I got there in about 20 seconds of running. It probably takes 2 minutes to run from one side of the map to the other. Apparently there is another map half way through the game, but it's even smaller than the first. Way to get my hopes up and then crush them.

It also runs terribly. It is older than GTA V, and GTA V looks better and runs better on my PC.

I do like the smooth combat though, I'll give it that. I just wish I knew when to execute, sometimes it seems random.

Blocking a hit before you die is also terrible. You drag the cursor into a circle, and press a random button. How creative. 

The skill tree is awesome though. I like the progression system a lot and the board of Orcs and Orc Captains. But again, killing them is just too repetitive. I also like reading Orcs' minds for intel on their captains and their locations. But again, too much repetitiveness. Just way too much of killing them.

And the cut scenes are long and too drawn out and over dramatic. I mean, did I buy a movie? I'm pretty sure they made a mistake, I bought a game, not a movie. If I wanted a movie, I would've bought a movie. Cutscenes are totally fine, but make them short and quick. I want to get back into the action.

The combat system felt a lot like the combat system in Assassin's Creed, but on the more offensive side. The Uruk hierarchy system is a great feature of the game but some bosses had features that were just crazy (immune to stealth, ranged and combat finishers for example). They were just really hard, but not in a challenging way. I felt like they could have done more with this system.

The story felt crazy short. 2 maps with little variety, I blazed through the story mode even though I didn't ignore sidequests (I didn't go out of my way to do them, but I'd do them as I pass them). Part of the story was also plain padding, for example you do quests with some random dwarf nobody that could've easily be let out. The ending was cool, but I'm a sucker for quicktime events. The ending hints towards a part two but leaves many questions open that IMO should've been answered in this game. Of course, an open end has to leave you guessing for more, but not dealing with a truly significant boss and totally not explaining why/how certain things happened in the ending scene just didn't feel like I finished the game.

This game was great for 6 hours. Everything after that is painfully boring. The combat, by design, goes from challenging to face-roll easy. At a certain point you're fighting these orcs as a formality; combat lasts as long as you feel like not instantly killing everything.

The world is pretty but empty but that's more of a Mordor thing, so good job I guess? 

The biggest offense here is the paper thin plot. Trust me, you'll know everything you need to know about the story after the intro cutscene/mission.

In all seriousness though, I can't say that I was impressed by this game and it's hard for me to recommend. The Nemesis system is far from mind-blowing although many reviews would claim the contrary. The main problem I found is that the game is very easy meaning you won't die all that often and it will be much harder to get a proper nemesis. The orc that ended up being my nemesis killed me a grand total of twice and I didn't even recognise his name  when he turned up to fight me.

The game performs reasonably well, even on my lower end system. My only gripe with the graphics options was that it used down-sampling to deal with jagged edges. This was heavily taxing on my system and thus meant that I had to play the game with horribly jagged edges. 

If these things don't bother you then, by all means, buy the game but be warned that the Nemesis system isn't all that it's cracked up to be.

This makes that you are not the only character in the game that is evolving and becomming stronger. This combined with beautifull graphics and combat that feels like the batman games and parkour skills of assassins creed, I can see why so many people recommend this game. And I feel like i should as well.

BUT,
I was honestly dissapointed. I was bored, very soon. The combat, although satisfying at start, quickly becomes dull. When you learn how to counter attacks, you can fight 2 Orc commanders and an army of 20 orcs around you all simultaniously while drinking coffee. And on itself, I could forgive that. But there is no variation. You will always be the same character with the same swords and quickly flash your bow to shoot a quick arrow. There are a couple skills when you level up, but there is honestly no real character development, you just become more powerfull and combat becomes even easier as you continue. I want to play as an dwarf or an elf, I want to use an axe, a spear or a shield. But none of that is possible.

I understand that in a scripted game with a lot of story focus, like in batman. you limit the players choices. But the story in this game is really not worth it. Except for one little funny orc, the characters lack charisma and personality. A linear journey of revenge, without heroism or morality.I feel like they didn't want to spend time on the story after creating this big beautifull open world, which is obviously enough too sell a game when people watch gameplay.

So yeah: you like batman and assassins creed, you will have fun with it. But don't buy this game if you want a good Lord of the Rings story or create your own unique hero, because this is something this game doesn't have."

It looks kinda pretty i guess and its not the worst game ever, but judging from the ""offical"" reviews its totaly overrated."

Graphics are fantastic...combat system is fantastic (although block being the same key as slow time/bow shot is STUPID)...ummm...the Nemesis system is kind of cool...

BUT

It is 1 dimensional to the point of absurdity.  You walk around killing orcs, then you do a quest where you kill orcs, then you walk around some more killing more orcs til you find another quest where you kill orcs in a certain amount of time.

ALL you DO...is KILL FREAKING ORCS...

Your ghost guy gets more powerful, so YOU CAN KILL MORE ORCS.

You don't buy stuff.  You don't find safety.  You don't have friends.  You don't to JACK SQUAT BUT KILL ORCS.

After about 1 hour...it more than gets old.

It has HUGE potential, I mean....  The graphics quality and combat system could be the next HUGE thing, but how about...more than one class...how about different styles of combat?  How about goals and personal achievement and doing more than...killing...orcs....in brutal ways over and over...it's almsot like...a zombie killer where the zombies can talk and taunt you.

I wish I hadn't paid for it.  I'm glad I waited til it was on sale, but even still, I just can't see myself spending much time on this game.

It doesn't even have a middle earth feel to it......because the entire game is set in mordor, it's more like a post apocalyptic zombie killer than a middle earth story."

2841,4,0.5622,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","This game is a lot of fun.  Until you die at the hands of two captains and two dozen minions with a bunch of unresolved power struggles quests that tend to resolve against your favor.  Then the upgraded captains, who've already proven they are tougher and stronger than you, now are outright impossible because they have outscaled you, and in order to beat them, you have to have access to higher-level combat abilities... which are only unlocked by beating the captains you just lost to.

I died too much in my first playthrough and had nowhere to make any decent progress, so I started an entirely new game just today.  I have died twice, once to a caragor (which is both understandable as they are brutal, and far more preferable than dying to an Uruk who gets upgraded by your death) and once during a confrontation quest with one captain and his minions while a neighboring captain and other neighboring minions joined in and wombo-combo'd me with heavy attacks and an AoE poison cloud attack that eventually whittled me down despite my best efforts and getting something like five or six Last Chance counters.  Suddenly both of those captains, who were already proven to be more than I could handled at my current ability tier, were now promoted and toughened up, and four other captains resolved their power struggles as well, all leveling up and filling in many holes I had created only hours ago.

The thing was, I chose this confrontation quest as what I thought would be a simple way to gain some power points/levels so I could unlock the next ability tier.  But that didn't happen, and now I'm hitting the same difficulty scaling I encountered on my previous save, after only two deaths.  I am unable to complete power struggles so I can't progress: meanwhile EVERY SINGLE ENEMY CAPTAIN benefits from my demise.

Standard combat is otherwise pretty fun.  I think Assassin's Creed does the same thing better.  I'm not sure that I like the auto-targeting on the attacks immediately after countering.  If I'm trying to isolate a Worm from the minions that are surrounding him by killing the minions, I don't want to automatically attack the Worm just because I successfully blocked his attack.

I really enjoy the overall tempo of the game: sneak-killing the archers, ambushing the ground-level troops, and interrogating the last minion about unknown captains.  Archery and Slow Time aren't great with a controller; I imagine it's fine with a mouse and keyboard but I prefer controllers and their more intuitive control schemes on these kinds of games anyway.

I got this game yesterday (4/24/15) as it was on sale for somthing like half-off including DLC, so I don't feel completely disappointed with my purchase.  Still, it breaks my cardinal rule of what makes a bad game bad: it doesn't let the player play even if you lose.  I get the feeling this game is really snowbally; either you luck out with some easy captains that get you to the later ability tiers, or you get absolutely curbstomped with no chance in hell of making a comeback.  And that's not a good game.  Sorry.  I want to like it, and I do like many aspects of it, including the now-famous Nemesis System.  But it scales way too hard to win my recommendation."

It is full of collision errors, has a framerate which requires some tweeking to fix (but isn't too bad) and the character is bland with a overused backstory. The only thing that is really all that unique in this game is the Nemesis system and I ended up with a nemesis that can only be damaged by one use CAMPFIRES!

Combat is fluid enough, it's got a couple of neat specials thrown in there to mix it up a little from just counter and attack. The world is dark, dangerous and baddies respawn so fast you generally have to fight or run your way just about anywhere. All that aside, to me Shadow of Mordor is a reskinned, slightly polished and with some expanded upon combat to it.. It's Assassins Creed guys. You climb up towers, you do main and side quests, you find artifacts and you can turn them around and have a look, you locate markings on walls and they in total they make up some kind of image. There's so much AC in this, even the minimap gave me a ""oh hello Ubisoft"" feeling the first second I saw it. The tried and tested Ubisoft formula of climbing up structures and a few other easily identifiable features previously seen in both AC and Lara Croft are present in this. Is it a bad game because of it? No. It's pretty good, if you like repetitive and you like the Nemesis system. I don't."

Enemies randomly appear in areas I just cleared, as well as appear in the ever-growing horde I'm in the middle of battling. Stealth is meaningless when enemies can randomly appear out of thin air. The combat is the same as the Batman games, where enemies attack in gangs and each need to be felled multiple times.

SoM had an extremely strong start, introducing a fresh way of generating new challenging minibosses. Collecting the extra content was simply laid out on the map, no need for a guide to dig up all those sweet lore bits and extra upgrades. As a fan of LotR, I also thought the timeline of SoM fix a neat little niche of history of Middle Earth. Thaaaaaaat's about all I liked.

The combat is usually the first thing people compliment but it was too grindy for me, and was riddled with buggy flaws. First off, its your typical Prince of Persia, Batman, Assassin's Creed, grindy, combofarming, 3rd-person fighter. With a timeslow meter for ranged abilities. It's fluid and once you know how to manipulate, or avoid, encounters of various sizes, it gets repetative and those flaws I meantioned stick out like a sore ball whenever they appear to fuck up your day.

Endgame is a load of laughs. About halfway through the unlockable skills, they're going to gradually make combat obscenely easy. There's a difference between rewarding mastery with a potent upgrade and giving the tools to endlessly combo through mobs. I'm not going to put any spoilers, so I'll just say the story also deteriorates significantly. Last two bosses are jokes, endgame boss is only a cutscene...

TL;DR: Starts strong, but continuously more fucky throughout the game.

Although it did a lot of things good I found it cutting a lot of corners.

And, it was, at least the fighting was. The combat was well done and I enjoyed fighting. When I looked it up online, the main feature seemed to be branding, warchiefs, and working your way up the ranks with your minions. The idea I thought would be fantastic, and it was for a time, but when you realise how pointless it really is... It kind of defeats the purpose of even engaging in the system apart from the Story.

I thought the combat was fun. The story was boring, as boring as I would've expected, but the lack of additional content felt as though it was unfinished. When I got to the second zone I felt I had experienced everything already so I basically went straight for the story with nothing new happening. The game isn't by any means bad, but I can't really recommend it. I played Black Flag not long ago and the amount of content there was, I basically went for the story last. 

Ultimately, if you're a fan of LOTR lore I'd recommend it. If not, meh. Spectating the society of the Uruks and their struggle for power and leadership... That almost made me jealous I wasn't playing an Orc. If they expanded on the idea, and made it more about the Uruks I think I would really enjoy something like that.

This game is fairly generic in every way. It's not the worst game I've ever seen and it's not the best. High quality of the assests of the game voice acting, textures, and graphical effects just aren't enough to save the game from being boring easy and repetative. 

The nemeesis system has been vastly overhyped as it all comes down to just murdering stat bags, except this time they have a different voice. When the solution to 85% of the problems in the game is to just hit it with your sword until it dies I found myself getting bored really fast as I knocked over orc captain after orc captain. 

Yet there are numerous little glitches and oddities that detract from the game too numerous to list. A small example that just broke my enjoyment of the game. I tamed a Caragor to set up a carnage fest for a mission to invade a feast. I trigger the mission and all my planning went to pieces. My trained Caragor vanished and the game quite insisted I play its way. Weird little things like this at all levels of gameplay has greatly soured my opinion of this game.

In no particular order, the negative:
- Mouse Accel sucks!  I want my PC games to have the option to actually get rid of this, and not require me to turn my mouse speed up to max just to play.
- 'Bosses' will escapes/vanish within range on you.  A minor annoyance...orc commanders will retreat, which is fine, but while chasing them, I don't think it's a good mechanic for them to simply disappear...ruins the fun of the chase!
- Boring story / unorigonal characters.  Wow...what an unorigonal story with copy/paste characters.
- Jump/sprint/climb/dodge bound to same key.  Another common problem with games designed for consoles.  I'd like the ability to run without climbing a nearby wall, please.
- Instant failure missions.  There are stealth 'missions' that you will instantly fail if an enemy spots you.  You can skip these if you want, but would mean your dagger wont be fully upgraded...which...does something, right?
- Branding/converting orcs is essentially useless.  Haven't really found any benefit to this.  They're easily killed and I haven't found a way to get them to actually help you unless they're already next to you.
- Lack of enemy types.  Orcs, wargs, trolls and goblin things.  Yes I know they're given different names, but that's what they essencially are.
- Combat often inturrupted by cutscenes.  This gets rather annoying quickly.  Every orc commander will have at-least 2 cutscenes, starting with a threat and ending with either last words of retreat.  Some can have 3 or more followers...giving you up to 8 or more unskippable cutscenes.)
- Cannot disable going to menu every time you pickup a relic/collectable (aside from plants).  Hey, a relic!  ~picks up, sent to menu, exit, exit, exit, back to game while listening to boring commentary.~
- Tutorials that reset.  Yes, I know how to evade a killing blow.  Thank-you for reminding me for the seventh time!

And in no particular order, the positive:
- Fun to just run around killing orcs.
- Environment looks nice.
- Graphics are great.
- Combat feels nice (when there's no cutscenes).

Your only objective is to walk around killing things. It's essentially assassin's creed. The title says Middle Earth and there are some encyclopedia entries in the game about places and things, but Mordor doesn't look like Mordor. Remember Sean Bean saying, ""It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire, and ash and dust...the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume...not with 10,000 men...it is folly..""? The story line isn't amusing at all, it's just a typical cockney pirates of the carribbean extra painted green or black etc. Your missions will be something like this: get into a specific place and kill 20-50 enemies/don't be seen, and we're gonna chain a bunch of mobs together to overwhelm you and we're gonna set 3-4 bosses on you at once so you can't ever finish a place and leave quietly. It is a story with a script, and you barely control the movement of the character. Can't tell you how many times I've wanted to run but the game thinks spacebar calls for a barrel roll, or wanted to climb a wall but the game thinks i just want to jump. Or getting off a roof onto a wire, the game thinks I would rather fall 40 feet right in the middle of a stronghold. And ofcourse Mordor is apparently China, where you can't move 1 meter without being spotted by 10-15 orcs who will waste your time. So you complete some weird quest, and a story cutscene opens, then repeat then repeat, no practice field nothing, you just get thrown into the game from the beginning and you have 30 hours til you're done.

The story, mechanics, world, and overall feel of the game give the impression of a team who really wanted to make something special, then got tired of it halfway through and just copied a bunch of already popular games.

The best and only original thing going for SoM is the nemesis system, which at first blush seems to add a lot of tactical depth to the game, but ultimately is just a means of prettying up the Orcs, since the same strategy (Try sneaking, then shoot them, then just start jumping over them and hitting them in the back a lot) works on all of them.

If you have played games in both the Assassin's Creed and Batman Arkham series, you have already played this game.  If you like them mechanically and don't mind a story that goes nowhere, you'll probably enjoy this for a couple weeks.  If you haven't, go play those instead."

However story is not Shadow of Mordor's strongest point though and the ending was a let down, for me, because we kill off the main antagonist in an interactive cut-scene. I wish we could have had an epic final duel with the main antagonist while orcs were constantly pouring out to kill us. It also would have been cool to see our personal orc army utilized in more situations.  Once you've branded every warchief and captain, there isn't anything to do with them. Would have been cool to maybe set the  army you amassed in Nurn against those in the Valley of Mordor or something like that.

2895,3,0.6783,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I struggled significantly with whether or not I should recommend this game; to say that I did not enjoy it would be a lie, but the question you undoubtedly want to know is whether it's worth the 50 bucks.  That being said, I cannot in good conscience say that it was.  Your money would be better spent on any number of other ""tried and true"" games.

Being a huge fan of Tolkien, I had high hopes for Shadow of Mordor.  I do, however, want to make it clear that what I have to say is arbitrary enough to apply even to those who have never read the books or watched the movies, let alone played the games.

Pros: 

- incredible graphics
     *Even with a nVIDIA GTX 750 Ti superclocked, breathtaking graphics quality.  
      Possibly outdoes Skyrim (although that wouldn't be as much of an achievement considering the    map size differences)

- excellent combat
     *Controls are great on PC and Xbox.  I felt that it was easier to use the special moves with a keyboard.

- relatively challenging
     *Definitely kept me on my toes, and even roused my ire a few times.  You will die, and you will die often.  
      One thing to note is the lack of difficulty settings; for Shadow of Mordor, it's one size fits all.


Cons:

- storyline
     *This is probably the most disappointing aspect for me.  Without going into details, the game's story starts out very engaging, but quickly becomes both monotonous and shallow.  The emotional connection which the player is encouraged to feel for both Talion and Celebrimbor (the ""person"" you play as) only serves to disappoint when no real resolution is to be had by the end of the story. This may be a necessity for an open world style game, and there is plenty of room for DLC to resolve some of the issues I have with it.  However, to really offer a sense of fulfillment the DLC would essentially have to be better than the main storyline... which, for those gamers out there, has never
occurred with the exception (possibly) of the Shivvering Isles for The Elder Scrolls ""Oblivion.""

- nemesis system
    *This was, as far as I can tell, the posterchild of Monolith's marketing attemps for Shadow of Mordor.  The general idea is that every interaction you have with any bad guy (whether killing or being killed) has an impact on the individual stats of each member of the Uruk hierarchy which exists in Mordor.  They can then challenge one another regardless of what the player is doing and seize new positions for themselves.  Each captain has a title, as well as his own special set of strengths and weaknesses which give him a drop of individuality, more or less.  Unfortunately, in my opinion the whole thing is more frustrating than it is intriguing.  If there is a video game component which detracts from the experience more than the nemesis system does, I am entirely unaware of its existence.  Sure, it's fun for a few minutes.  But after the first or second hour of playing, I was completely tired of it.  In all honesty, it's more of a compensation for the lack of story material than it is a revolutionary idea.  I would have personally been much more satisfied with a smaller number of purposefully and expertly designed foes than an endless horde of computer generated nemeses.

- Character Development (or lack thereof)
     *I wanted to make this point separately from that of the storyline deficiencies.  No character in the game is really developed at all through the progression of missions and tasks.  They come and go, making a few vague comments about their past in the interim.  But this is supposed to be a role playing game.  Shadow of Mordor builds some excellent foundations for what could have been a phenomenal RPG, but the development just isn't there.  Every time I became interested in and excited about the development of friendships within the story, or the revelations which Talion and Celebrimbor experience, my expectations were quietly crushed by docile, plot killing
voids.

Conclusion:

Overall, this game kept my attention, or at least my hopes, high enough to play it through to the end.  However, after about 35 hours of play time and a heap of disappointment, I can't recommend that you pull out your wallet for this one unless it's on sale for much less than 50 clams."

I upraded my card (not for the sake of this game) to a 290 and it runs almost everything on Ultra. Looks great. However this doesn't take away from the fact that the environment is bland and unvaried. The gameplay, while fun at first is repetitive, but not in the good way. The gameplay, though it has a short, interesting story consists mostly of mini situational events that are created locally. It break any sort of immersiveness and gives me the feeling that it's more of an arcade game than something to take seriously.

The nemesis system is shallow, until later in the game. The lack of variety early on makes things incredibly dull and the character you play as has a mishapen face. Lol, this may make you chuckle but they evidently screwed up Talion's face so it can fit the boney elvish face of the spirit. Too obvious and it just gives Talion a weak chin that just, looks odd at times.

Audio is good, though due to the lack of variety in game, there's only so many spirity, fiery, bitey, swordy sounds before it sounds the same. The main thing is the quality of the audio, which is great (if you have a decent audio setup to enjoy it).

DLC is seperate instances that are played outside of the main game, which gives off that usual disconnected feeling I get when playing any sort of side mission in the main game.

Is it worth the original price? Hell no. Did I pay full price? Lel, no and I wouldn't either. Sale item, £20 or less and no more than that. 

Oh, I almost forgot... there is zero feedback to tell you when automatic saves have occurred. None. Zero. I can only imagine that fast travelling to safe zones would prompt one to occur, which is what I do anyway, but I figured I'd let you all know.

     If you aren't a fan of the Land of Mordor, you may realize that it is much more worthwhile to buy games like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, the Assasins Creed Games, and even the Batman Arkham series for their similar mechanics that are the star features in this one. For example, the main tool that the main character has, the wraith world ability, is very close to the werewolf ability in Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. The Wraith dude that talks to you while playing is very similar to Midna besides the fact that Link didn't have to go through as much pain as the main character in this goes through, but in Twilight Princess the wolf is much more useful for solving puzzles and fighting monsters in combat. Also, the wolf features much more polished mechanics and the attacks are satisfying. In Shadow of Mordor, the Wraith is mainly only used in bushes in order to sneak around along with shooting arrows. While the Wraith Ability is the reason the main character is alive to fight these orcs once again, the gameplay aspects of this pale in comparison. 
     
     The human aspect holds up weakly as well. The combat of the Assasins Creed games and the Arkham series games are also very simlar to this game, and it seems like they are mixed together although the level designs are much more balanced with the fighting mechanics in those. The orcs in this game feel great to fight one on one, but when twenty to fifty orcs are on your ass the gameplay feels clustered. There are enemies who poison you, smash you with shields, and bum rush you while you are attacking an enemy. There are also orcs that are invincible to arrows, swords, and stealth attacks. If you decide to run away from the fifty orcs on your ass, you are punished if you die from something completely unrelated. If an orc captain runs away from you, he is promoted for surviving a human. Also,if your character dies in the vacinity of a captain, he will be promoted as well. I don't know if this was a glitch when this happened, but it happened a few times and is very annoying. I am not saying that the game is difficult, but it is far too complicated. There is way too much for the player to pay attention to while trying to fight orcs. 

For every aspect or feature shown in this game, there is another game out there that does that aspect or feature much better. I do not recommend playing it. When I did, the clustered controls caused it to feel like a bad dream. Luckily, I am out of that dream. Goodnight."

The story is relativel short, and even with goofing off within the world, I still beat it in around ten hours. The combat is nice and fluid for the most part, though I felt at times that the climbing wasn't responding how I thought it should.

The Nemesis system was something I was thoroughly looking forward to, since to me, it was the first real feel of a next generation system. In theory, the Nemesis system works very well, but here's the problem: The Game is to Easy! There are people that of course will say, ""if it's so easy, don't spend any skills."" Whats the point in even having those skills in the first place then? Aren't they made for you to try them out, killing orcs in every possible way? The moment when I was fighting eight orc captains, and a war chief was when I realized that if you don't let yourself, die, or let a captain retreat, the Nemesis system won't work as intended.

As for the story itself, as a massive fan of LOTR and Tolkiens Middle-Earth in general, I was put off by multiple things. First off is how Celebrimbor's story is altered. Sauron never touched the three elvish rings, and it was only his knowledge that Celebrimbor used to craft them. However, we see him picking up what I'm guessing is Narya, the Ring of Fire which was later given to Gandalf. 

Next is of course what happened after Eregion was destroyed by Sauron's forces. Celebrimbor died in 1697 of the Second Age, and though it isn't said where he died, if it was in Eregion or not, my problem is how they show him completing the One Ring for Sauron. Sauron crafted it himself, without the help Celebrimbor, and while it is possible that Sauron used what he had learned of elvish craftmanship since Celebrimbor was of the Noldor, it is highly unlikely that Celebrimbor would have ever even touched the One Ring.

I could go on about the other problems and the inconsititencies, but the one thing that really threw me off, was the way it ended. Expecting a grand boss battle against the Black Hand, I was treated to a quicktime event, showing how the game ended that made me ask ""Thats it?"" 

All in all, the combat is a lot of fun, and controlling your own orc army is also fun (though this doesn't happen till the last 3/4's of the game), but with a boring story, and a world that seems to define the meaning of repetative, I honestly can't recommend this game."

If you want to play a game about killing orks (Uroks) then I recommend this game for you because it was bloody, brutal and entertaining.

9/1/17

I changed my review because WB is a terrible publisher and no one should ever buy from them. I wan everyone to look at the trailer for the man that died at Monolith. That special DLC that is supposedly being donated to the family of the man that passed away. The charity that WB says they are doing is false. Not only will 44 states only donate, but they are also only giving a percentage of the money that they will earn and are keeping the rest. WB is disgusting for earning a profit off of someone that passed away. I will no longer support any WB published game from here on out. It's not about the loot crates in single player games, its the disgusting business practices that WB does."

I was really excited at first. The combat positively reminded me of the Batman series, and to slay orcs instead of knocking out thugs was really satisfying. Combining that with the visual effects and animations of all the different moves you perform on those ugly bastards.. So nice and brutal at the same time!

The nemesis system is also very fun for the first part of the game. There is a lot of diversity in terms of character for the captains and warchiefs, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses. This really gives them an unique feel. Slaying them felt like an achievement and it was terrifying to encounter multiple of them at the same time. 

The story seemed great at first as well, with the main character (whom has good voice acting) getting to know the past of the wraith. Gollum his role in this is a real nice touch. Though, you're likely to ignore the story until you've messed around enough with the nemesis system.

[b] -- Second part of the game -- [/b]

But then you get to the second part of the game..  As you build up your character, the game begins to gradually bore the crap out of you. Groupfights that were first better to be evaded, become super easy. The captains and warchiefs become a joke. You can kill them off pretty quickly, no matter what their strenghts/weaknesses are. Only dying once in the game also left me with no real nemesises to deal with. I felt as if I could just straight up walk to Sauron myself and kill him with one slap to the face (if he were in the game).

Apart from the nemesis system becoming dull due to how badly it keeps up with the player, it also becomes clear that there's no real reason to invest time into it. You will notice nothing of importance out of all the work you've put into killing those officers and 'taking command'. The only difference is that you'll have less angry officers and more friendly officers roaming around.

The story feels empty apart from the 'get to know the wraith's past' missions. While I'm normally all into singleplayer stories, I couldn't care less about this one... no matter how hard I tried. Nothing really felt of importance to reach the ultimate goal; killing the 3 big bosses.
Gameplay-wise, the story missions felt like an interactive movie. The game will guide you so much, that there's no real space for solving the encountered problems on your own. It's way too lineair for an open world Middle Earth version of Batman. Even Batman gave you more freedom during missions.. In closed environments!


[b] -- And then this happened.. -- [/b]

Completing the ultimate boss battles through quicktime events.

What. The. Fuck.

I'm not talking about the kind of quicktime boss battles that God of War has.. Nope. The first quicktime boss requires you to press two keys only, without any other challenge. The second quicktime boss, which is the final boss, only requires you to press five keys.. three are the same key, all of them require no real timing.

So. I've upgraded my character almost to the maximum. Did challenges and found collectables. Helped slaves and rebels. Ploughed through Sauron's minions, captains and warchiefs.... All of this to get to the close servants of Sauron, and it's just thrown away.

2925,3,0.429,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","First I'll mention the good things. One of the most notible things was how great the Uruk's looked. Each had their own unique looks and even personalities. Other notible thing was that the executions were just pure joy everytime you pulled them off.
Now the bad. First thing I noticed was the combat was similar to the Batman Arkham series. This isnt necissarily a bad thing, but for me in the worl of Lord of the Rings, it just didnt make sense to me. And really the combat is just frustrating all around, especially later in the game. I say this because you dont really have full control on who in the hell you attack. Sure you can point the joystick, or what ever control system you are using, in the direction of the one you want to attack, but you can have like 20 or more enemies attacking you at the same time. But what is so god awful is when you have the ability to convert some enemies to fight for you and help you in battle BUT YOUR CHARACTER WILL ATTACK THEM EVEN IF YOU ARE TRYING TO SLASH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. Now what makes this frustrting beyond belief is when you send your converted Uruk to assassinate a warchief in a secluded area (my plan was to help my Uruk kill the warchief so he would then be promoted afterwards) and as I went to grab the warchief when he was weak to brand/convert him to my side my character goes through the warchief and grabs my Uruk that was on my side and THROWS HIM OFF THE CLIFF KILLING HIM. And when this happens the ""Assassination attempt"" fails and the warchief regains his health and becomes stronger. 
Also the size of the map is really small and no real incentive to go around and explore even though you can look for artifacts of sorts but they just arent that interesting.
And the game itself is just completely short. I literally thought I was just getting started with the game when the credits started to roll. But really the most dissapointing thing was I was misled to believe that the ranking system of the Uruks was MUCH larger than what is in the game. Really they only have like 4 tiers I think? But when you get to the warchiefs I guess I assumed it would go way beyond that.
Overall the game is a huge dissapointment. I just cant underdtand the great reviews and game of the year awards. Found the game to be quite mediocre. I got it on sale for $30 and it wasn't worth that at all. $20 at most I'd say.

2932,3,0.5183,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This game was okay, until the end, but only okay, and then not at all okay. Infuriating, actually.

This game is somehow both terribly boring and quite addictive. When I wasn’t playing it, I didn’t miss it, but once I was playing it, I didn’t want to stop. Functionally it’s an Assassin’s Creed/Tomb Raider/Far Cry style of gameplay, with a basic storyline and a heap of side objectives. The game is pretty, the platforming is well done, and the combat is a lot of fun, but that's about it. There is really nothing exceptional about it, and there’s a whole lot not to like, although you won’t know it until it’s over.

[Very mild spoilers follow – no plot details, just what to expect for the last 30 minutes of the game.]

First of all, you spend the bulk of your time fighting captains over, and over, and over again, thinking you’re doing yourself a favour, but all you’re doing is producing more captains to fight. Over. And over. AND OVER. And in the end, the army that you build for yourself is basically useless. You don’t need it. At all. Except that it’s part of the main quest, so you have to do it anyway. The only other alternative for gaining your skills is chasing bonus objectives, but you’re still going to have to build that army.

I completed 100% of the side objectives. I’m normally not sucked in by bonus objectives, but I really wanted to be maxed out before the final fight because the early fights had hinted at a challenge. Once I was maxed out, I was only a few objectives from 100% anyway, so I finished them off. What a waste of time.

The side objectives are pretty easy, but have very little relevance to the plot. There are 4 groups of them. Two sets are utterly pointless as far as the plot goes, one is tangentially relevant but too obscure to be worth the effort and the other provides some background lore that you don’t really need. I didn’t mind doing them until I got to the last mission and realized I didn’t need to spend all that time getting skill points. At all. At best, the extra skills were useful for accomplishing objectives in the strongholds a little more easily, but even then I don't think I used most of them.

The last few combat segments, the ones that trigger the “there’s no going back til you’re done” message, which you’d think would be challenging, are almost effortless. You might want to argue that this is because I’d maxed out my skills, but it isn’t. I didn’t even use any skills to defeat the enemies (the ones that weren’t QTE fights anyways) beyond the execution finisher, which you learn very, very early on. I didn’t NEED those skills. None of them! I didn’t need my army either. They helpfully got rid of a few of the easy enemies, but they didn’t do anything I couldn’t have done myself, alone, with only the skills earned through the main quest.

Oh yeah, and about those QTE fights? I don’t mind a little QTE here and there. But seriously…the final fight was solely QTE. I did not take one swing. Not one. What the actual fuck? It was completely anticlimactic, and I felt like I’d just wasted 35 hours of my life building up my skills and mastering their use for nothing. I’d been hoping to encounter a fight that would have been insanely challenging with just the main story skills, but comfortably challenging with the full set. Instead I got a few large groups that were easier to deal with than a stronghold and a QTE fight that required no effort at all. What a letdown.

Don't get me wrong - I did enjoy playing it enough to spend 35 hours on it. But you spend that sort of time on a game with the expectation of some degree of satisfaction at the end, and that never happened. 

As for how the story ended – I suppose it was intriguing. Or would have been, if I had any intention of paying money for the DLC, which I didn't even before I'd started playing.

TL;DR: The game was sort of fun, but most of it was a huge waste of time. If you’re going to play it, just follow the main quest, don’t get caught up all the extra skill points, rune, attributes or branding extra enemies for your army. Just finish the story and get out.

Not recommeding it, even though you get the gameplay hours for your dollar, and it is sort of fun until the letdown. But it's really just another overhyped AAA that happens to be set in Middle Earth. You've probably already played it in another form, so unless you're really into the lore, don't bother."

So the cliff notes
Do I Recommend the game? YES
Is the game for everyone? Hell NO

First things first let me get this off my chest; the starting sequence doesn't explain anything! What is Mordor? as someone who is not attuned to the LotR lore I thought a brief explanation would have been a nice and on top of that I didn't really have time to get attached to the character I was playing which seemed important for me to be doing with the whole wife and son scene. 

Next up; the world. Graphically this game is pretty amazing the textures are sharp and consistent even on medium settings but where is falls of is the terrain.. sometimes you just find yourself in an area that has nothing but terrain. There is no clutter at all in this game which I think was supposed to be part of the atmosphere but just ends up making the place look ugly and bare.

Game play: First of all I want to say that the overall general feel of combat is really nice but it seems to get very repetitive very fast and the moment you have counter down to an art it also becomes very underwhelming; They tried to throw in the odd challenge through the use of NPCs that can't be hit with normal melee swings but they can also be easily be countered by spamming space and leaving them until last. What's worse is that these special enemies only seem to appear during boss fights making them even less interesting.

Next up the missions: The missions in this game are very very linear and the side quests are pointless; what I failed to understand was why they made Mordor feel like a HUB with random enemies scattered across the plains to impede you in anyway possible but then at the same time give you the ability to ride the crazy tigers to avoid everything in between quests; Seems to me they could have made a better game if they left out the open world part because this just feels like something from the early PS2 days.

The open world: First of all, don't drop a character into an open world like this without explanation. This game should have started with a few linear path quests and then gone open world this would have help immensely in getting the plot rolling and maybe would have made want to invest emotionally in the main character/s

Overall: I have to say this game is good, not great and it was certainly not worth the praise it got from reviews. As someone who isn't that into LotRs I feel like those reviews were a little bias and this probably would have been hated had it carried any other name and/or characters.

I normally would have waited for the price to come down before considering buying the game but I'd seen several favorable reviews and had some friends whose opinions I trust rave about it.  So the fact that I'm out 50 bucks and am now actively perusing for a new game to play to scratch the fantasy itch less than 48 hours after downloading the thing is really nobody's fault but my own. 

That said, there were some enjoyable aspects of the game. I think what made it particularly frustrating was how badly I wanted to like it. It was quite pretty to look at. It drew from the Silmarillion which will is always nice and the six decades between The Hobbit and Fellowship of the Ring is a fairly wide open arena which could be the setting for a good number of Middle Earth themed games.  Sadly, what we got was Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor. 

My biggest beef with the game was the mechanics of the thing.  For a game that wanted so badly to grab the Assassin's Creed torch it didn't seem to grasp any of the areas where Assassin's Creed could have been improved upon. (Though to be fair neither has AC.)  For a game that requires you to be in stealth mode for the vast majority of it, forcing the player to hold one button down continuously to achieve this is just bad game design.  Then the game devolves to fighting which is long and needlessly monotonous. The whole point, at least in my opinion, of a kill stike on a stunned or fallen foe it to remove one of the enemy combatants from play so you can focus on the others. I love pretty animation as well as the next guy but making each finishing move little more than an opportunity for every other Orc in Mordor to gang up on you (usually before you can actually top the guy you were trying to kill) sort of defeats the purpose of it.  However, quirky game mechanics can be overcome and overlooked if the game has an engrossing enough plot and/or a protagonist that is likeable or at the very least engaging enough to want to spend many hours with. 

Unfortunately the hero in Shadow of Mordor has the depth of a saucer and the personality of lukewarm oatmeal in a beige bowl. The underlying story could have been interesting if moving it forward didn't involve you simply repeating the same actions over and over again until you've lost the thread of it and  od on apathy.  It just seemed to me like a good deal of wasted potential.  The nemesis system was a neat idea that, at least in as far as I got in the game which admittedly wasn't that far, they ultimately did nothing with.  In some ways the game would have been considerably more interesting if they did away with Talion and the Bright Lord's (won't say more for spoilers-though as someone who has read the Silmarillion I sussed out who the Wraith was pretty early on) storylines altogether and just had  you play as one of the Orcs.  Ratbag is arguably the only engaging character in the entire game and clearly the power struggles among the Orcs were where the game designers really wanted a chunk of the game to be focused on. Unfortunately a huge amount of it happens offscreen because you're stuck following Talion around. 

As I said, there was a lot in this game that could have been really cool and I get why many people do like the game quite a bit. Any one of the flaws I mentioned would have been perfectly livable with were the rest of the game better executed.  Clunky gameplay coupled with a character that I honestly couldn't care less about simply couldn't be overcome by a collection of really interesting plot points held together only by a mediocre story. It just wasn't enough to hold my interest for long which was sad as I  had actually been fairly pumped to play it."

It has a stealth system with its own host of unique stealth takedowns. It even has its own mount system. But overall the game seems to fall short.

Why it falls short:

1) To easy: This game is extremely easy and I have only died twice do to getting used to the controls. Fighting giant hordes of 50+ enemies sounds difficult. It's not. You will methodically build up your hit counter to 8 by mashing the attack button then execute one enemy at a time. Enemies can't touch you if you counter. You have plenty of time to counter your enemies attacks at the button prompt. This game has a lack of difficulty settings (or i just can't find them).

2)Nemesis System: Most people see the nemesis system as an amazing feature that sets this game apart. It is inovative and unique. But it ultimately falls short. This ties in with the game being too easy. I have never been killed by a captain or warchief (and by no means am I good at these kinds of games) so I have never seen them become stronger and gain cooler abilities. Throughout the game you will care less and less about captains and warchiefs as they become orcs that look slightly different and take a couple more hits to take down.

3)The Story/Plot: The story in this game is hit and miss. It starts strong with emotional connections to characters and strong emotional moments that move the player and give the story its drive. It is also interesting to see characters you recognize from the LOTR universe. However, the story becomes less inspired as the game moves along. Things become less and less explained, and it leaves you wondering ""Who is this person"" and ""Am i supposed to know that guy"". The game has some big revelations that leave the player thinking ""cool, that was neat"". 

All in all I don't think Shadow of Mordor is a bad game. It is probably one of, if not the best, LOTR game to date. I just feel that a few aspects of the game fell short of my expectations. It is still a solid buy if you are a fan of the universe or need a game that is similar to Assassins Creed. If you aren't sure, wait for a sale and pick it up a little cheaper."

However, combine all these aspects and SoM has a very short shelf-life - one that is massively marred by that thorn in the side of many 'open world' games. That of enemy respawning.

SoM takes the sole breed of enemy opposition (the uruks) and sprinkles them in the game world everywhere. And I mean EVERYWHERE. If we ever needed to terraform a planet in the future - uruks would be the species of choice. Murder a handful and no sooner have you turned around, but another batch appears to try and stop your charismatic ranger.

Worse - when they gang-up on you - they attack in that weird 70s kung-fu film cliche where one enemy attacks at once, rather than the whole throng of twenty coming in at once for a true kicking. As such, the game descends (very rapidly) into a repetitive button mash on a 360 controller. X, X, X, X, X, Y to block, X, X, X, X, Y&B to execute, X, X, X, X, X..... and so on. As said, the executions are fun initially, but once seen several dozen times, they get all a bit 'meh'.

Then there's the rescuing of the poor, innocent humans that are being forced to work as slave labour. Initially I threw myself into liberating fellow humans - until I realised that just like the uruks - they are everywhere. Sure, you free a handful, they pledge their thanks and off they scurry. Then I walk 100 yards and see the exact same situation around the corner.

And this in a nutshell, is where SoM falls massively short on enjoyment. You do the same thing again and again and again - without any real sense of progression or that you're impacting directly upon the numbers of uruks. Uruks might as well be grains of sand - a never-ending drove of gormless, relentless enemies that are stabbed, cleaved, cut, shot, blown-up and beheaded en masse. And for what?

Shadow of Mordor has the makings and mechanics of a truly amazing game. I can only begin to hope and realise what a co-op version of this with a quartet of players like Gauntlet would be like. But as it is, you're a John Rambo in ranger form - taking on all and sundry with your own hands. And surprisingly, not a good game does that make.

Everything worked as expected - no problems and I was enjoying the game play. Typically with me the first Avatar was weak, so I deleted the save game and started over. All was well until I emerged on the tower: my mouse was dead. I could move (WASD) but could not rotate the camera to see where I was moving. The mouse worked fine in the menus, but no where else.

I immediately searched the web for others having similar problems. I found around a half dozen different sites referencing the problem. No one had a fix. There were lots of suggestions, but no fix. I was dead in the water and lamenting my purchase - it is very frustrating when a brand new game you paid good money for is providing you with nothing of value.

The game has given me no value so far for my money. I believe the game will eventually be patched and will pay off in entertainment, and when it does I suspect I will enjoy it - and at that point I will post an updated review. For now it is giving me about the same amount of value as it would have if I had left it sitting on my STEAM wishlist. So, on a scale of 1-5 I give it a one, with hopes that it will eventually bring itself up a few notches. I will not currently recommend it to anyone.

bought the game 3 days after christmas... Direct X11 ***ONLY***, first time i hear about directx uncompatible games... 

STEAM: thank you for the japanese language notice, very helpful (sarcastic)

i check ram pcu and video card requirements, never tought of checking my direct x version, my pc runs all crysis on max but i cant play this game!!!

dont download it before checking your system, its a 37gb download, for nothing in my case.

my 2gb gtx 260 is obselete, my alienware m11x laptop is obselete. not just a bit sluggish, we are talking COMLETELY uncompatible here. i gotta spend 160$ for another 2gb video card to play the game... and throw away a perfectly good card, a perfectly good 2gb card that plays all my other games... bummer.

Thank god i bought ithe game on sale, but its a major problem.

p.s. all you people who have dx11 seem easy to blame us for not being up to date with our hardware, but i dont want to change my laptop, and my tower has a 2gb card that is simply not compatible, you can claim dx10 is obselete and we should read specs and we should upgrade etc etc, but its easy to say if you already have the damned compatible hardware. basically this game made me learn my current card is obselete now, i learned the hard way. the expensive and loooooong way cuz my connection aint that great. i wish this comment would have been on the first page i read where everybody gave the game amazing results. i waited two days for the thing to complete and i cant even play it.

i bet its great, but its ultimately unplayable for me before i can cough up another 200$ for something compatible that will run the game smoothly, ask me to give it 10/10, how much points does a game loose for being a videocard killer???

Pros:

Great voice acting.
Nice graphics, that's literally it.

Cons:

Main story is about 2 hours, even I could of came up with that poor excuse for a game.
All side missions are 3 minute minigames of, save x, kill x, stealth kill x.
The world is 2 boring areas with little in the way of excitement or attention to detail.
Collectibles, collectibles, collectibles.
Carbon copy of the Witchers sword set up.
End fight is a total bore and is 3 minutes story, 1 minute QTE.
Another game that seems to find climbing towers to unlock world content is original - Beyond overdone.
Fighting is completely easy, spam right mouse and spacebar to win. Spam arrows to win.
AI has down syndrome, climb a building in their face and they lose track of you allowing you to stealth kill half the mob.
Run away from a fight you're losing to a plant to gain full health - No incentive to take combat seriously.
No sense of fear or massive battles you know you can't win.

Shadow of Mordor is beautiful and the story is one of the most compelling I've ever played. That said, combat is pretty dry and by the end of the game amounts to doing your best to avoid ridiculous numbers of orcs by abusing the same stealth mechanics over and over again. The final boss fights were incredibly disappointing in how simple they were. They basically consist of having your hand held through completing simple objectives like stealth attacks and timed strikes that you learn early on in the game. To put this in perspective: I had a harder time defeating some of the orc captains (and their hordes of uruk) than I did beating all three of the final bosses. Kind of a let down.

I loved the atmosphere that some of the boss fights created, but personally that only kept me from believing that the boss fights themselves were an afterthought.

2987,0,0.3406,"buy, money, work, run, pc, fix, still, say, try, start","Firstly, on a 1-5 star rating system this game on PC deserves about a 2. Unless you have six hands, seventy fingers, 3 mice, and 2 keyboards, you're going to hate playing this . Most of the time the game simply ignores input from the player because it's more interesting in stringing together the combat moves of your opponents. This is exacerbated by the fact that several commonly chained commands use the same key/button. This results in about half the things you need to do to get through a mission becoming impossible because the game simply doesn't get the perfect combination of 20+ factors required to execute a move. Case in point: one mission required using a stealth special kill move on a character on a low platform. Hitting the proper keys actually would launch the move on any of the 50+ orcs watching him- instant suicide. You may ask why the same keys do multiple functions. The answer is the devs simply ran out of keys on the keyboard. No kidding; even with the combined functions, there are over 40 command keys in use. Considering you're supposed to activate multiple combinations of these at various times while constantly trying to sort out strengths and weaknesses of nearly identical orcs and looking for visual cues in a fast-paced, fluid combat environment, the game simply becomes unplayable by normal means. Extensive cheating gives me an approximation of entertainment via my one working hand and 13-button mouse, but I still spend way too much time enraged because the game simply doesn't respond to commands. Using low-med custom graphics, the game world is beautifully rendered, but that was about the extent of the devs' focus. RPG fans will be disappointed because the storyline is extremely fragmented and disorienting, while action fans will get tired of constantly having to sneak past a hundred orcs to get where they're going. Stealth fans will enjoy this until they realise most of the stealth involves the same two or three tactics and mostly serves to slow the game down. Basically, what you end up with is an incredibly feature-rich game concept that ultimately only serves to destroy everything good about itself after the firs couple hours. It's also worth noting that eventually game mechanics make character advancement slower than in some MMOs. Bottom line: You've got a beautifully ugly game-world and a ton of frustration, and this is supposed to not only be worth 30-60 bucks at the start, but also make you interested in paying at least that much again for DLC while taking roughly 40Gb of hard drive space without the hi-res texture pack addon and  which requires a roughly $5000 custom computer to run above medium settings, and you've got yourself a money pit that would make World of Warcraft jealous. I wouldn't recommend paying more than 10-15 bucks for this at normal price. Oh, they also want you to sign up for a WB account, and while the game itself loads quite quickly on a decent machine, you're forced to watch every ad and startup cutscene every time you load the launcher. On my roughly $1500 custom rig, it takes a good 5 mins. to get the launcher up. This was a C-mas request that had me very excited at first, but now has me thinking ""Bah, Humbug.""

Commenting my own review a few years later. It's worth adding a few extra lines to my overly long review. Best rating method I can imagine for this game is to list the 3 worst xmases in my 36 years thus far:
#1. The year my dad died Dec 31st
#2. The year I got nothing I asked for and my primary gift required physical functionality I lost the year before.
#3. The year I was so excited about this game I was willing to make it my only gift for the next...ten...months
If none of that convices you to run away and never look back, consider that I haven't launched this game in 3 years, and was willing to verify my age...again... just so I could tell Steam to stop trying to sell me its even more boring sequel.
If I live fifty more years, I will never pay for anything resembling this game. I actually couldn't be paid enough to play it, and my hobby is fixing things like Windows 10, viruses, and malware for people twice my age. Kids, if someone with a hobby two steps shy of being a crash test dummy says playing a game is too hard on them, you might want to remember that before you get out your wallet. :)"

It is brutal, violent and intense, A mixture of stealth and brute force is needed to win. The story is great for people who are into the lore of Middle-earth. The nemisis system is an interesting concept that allows you to make your own mini-stories.

However, after awhile the combat becomes tedious and overwhelming. The problem is that more often than not there are a lot of enemies on you, and even if you kill a bunch they often just keep coming. While I appreciate the challenge, I grew tired of constantly having to run from batles that would simply not end. These problems would not be so bad except that the game also feels too long.

It soon becomes repetitive and tasteless afterwards. Sure, it is fun to manipulate the power struggle in the orc society, to make your own rune combination, and to unlock kick-ass combat skills, but where is the challenge? Pretty soon after you start playing this game, you'll find yourself slaughtering the orcs with fully unlocked skill trees. I really tried to discover some 'fun factors"", hunting down the orcs, trying to find the ""perfect"" runes, etc, but what's the point? I'm already a god-like unbeatable maniac, killing orcs whenever and however I want. (After a certain point, I started feeling sorry for those orcs being mass-murdered by my crazed killing spree)

Don't get me wrong. As I said in the beginning, it is an exciting game. But only in the beginning of the gameplay. It's very disappointing... not because it's plainly bad, but because it has so much potential that wasn't fully developped. It could have been really huge. What a waste.

Generate a mission map with a small amount of mission types repeating. Then add Assassin's Creed running, jumping, and climbing (which sometimes works and often leaves you rolling against a wall) mechanics and random stuff to collect.

The entire gameplay of this seems to be just chopping through horde after horde of enemies until you are overrun, or you decimate them all.  Arrows / Spears are a royal pain in the backside.  No matter what I tried I'd either get hit by them in battle or I wouldn't, while the player character threw himself from one enemy to the next.  Another annoyance were the pikemen (I'm guessing those are pikes anyway), who have a big ""A"" flash above them.  The idea is you push ""A"" and you will dodge their attack.  I wasn't button mashing in the fights, and I tried both tapping and holding""A"" when the prompt appeared.  Not ONCE did he dive out of the way.  I'm sure there will be more unlocks later in the game to make dealing with them easier - but I didn't want easier, I wanted a simple game mechanic to work as required.

I picked this up as it was being touted around as being like an Assassin's Creed game with slightly better combat, set in the LOTR universe.  This seemed to me to be a pretty sweet idea, and I can honestly say (having recently completed Black Flag) that this is NOTHING like Assassin's Creed.  The parkour controls are pure garbage, with the controller laid out in a less than optimal fashion.  The stealth is pitiful in comparison to an Assassin's Creed game.  If you want to sneak you either hold the sneak button and hope for the best, hide behind or on top of walls (behind is so easy to accidentally pop out from, and on top due to the afore mentioned poor parkour controls it is easy to get stuck in place for a moment on), dangle underneath people on ledges, or hide in horrible looking bushes.  That's it.

If you get seen you can run around like Benny Hill until you have darted around enough corners for the enemy to not see you hide in the bushes, or you can stand and fight.  If you are in a stronghold you cannot deactivate the alarms, and if you get swarmed while taking down one enemy who is running to set off the alarm, another will do so instead.  I know this is more realistic, it just means that most of the time if one of them sees you you have no choice but to flee or to take on the entire stronghold at once.  The first few times this is a bit exciting.  Then it becomes frightfully boring.

This is not like Assassin's Creed.  It is like Dynasty Warriors."

First off, the production values of this game are very high. top notch visuals, great voice acting, good combat system, and a beautiful environment. However, this game fell short of my liking, and I was soon finding it repetitive and just pushing forward. I fail to see how anyone would be interested in doing minless subquests of the same objective over and over. The storyline was lacking, and not particularly interesting on enjoyable. The combat system was well done, and thankfully for that matter, because the entirety of the game is fighting. I cant say that this game offers anything new or interesting, other than the orc system which consists of some gruesome looking orcs pitting for power over oneanother. I most defenitely regret buying this game for fullprice. It is a typical, polished, simplistic console game for gamers who dont want anything too heavy. 
This game shines nicely for about 4 hours, then gets lame and repetitive."

3002,4,0.6026,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","This is probably one of the most frustrating games of the year. 
Why? Because of several reasons. 

First of, I think the QA have done a terrible job in finding all the bugs and glitches and the annoying repeats of death in this game.
I constantly get stuck on ledges when jumping on the roofs and ruins. This is not helped by the terrible camera that constantly struggles to fight against you, and there is plenty of times that I run blindfoldly around as the camera decides to look whats behind me instead of where I'm running.

Then we have the buttons. You are usually surrounded by more enemies than you can handle, witch leads you to take heavy damage and forcing you to retreat to find some healing herbs (Why couldnt they give us healing potions to use in combat?), but these healing herbs can only be gathered by pressing a button, the same button that grabs hold of an enemy. So while you run up to a herb, with enemies breathing down your neck, all of a sudden when you desperatly try to grab that herb you intead grab a confused enemy.

We have the anoying repeats of death, where each time you respawn get to hear the exact same booring conversation with the spirit and yourself (It's like listening to ""snaake? Snaaaake?? SNAAAAAAKE!!"" in Metal Gear all over again, but this time its when you respawn). Oh, and did I mention that every time you spawn all your hard work in killing the officers are nullified in the way that new officers take their place? This is quite anoying when you are on missions where you are supposed to kill a commander and need to kill the officers first and everything gets ""reset"" just because you die of the stupid controllers/camera.

Oh, and about killing officers. This part of the game is not thought through, as when you want to kill a specific officer you head to the area where he is and hunt him down. The bad part is that when you find him, you usually also find one or two more officers that you did not expect to be there. So instead of fighting one officer, you have to fight two, three, four or even more. Oh, and even in those cases where you find the officer to be alone with only common minions, its more than often that either the officer or a minion calls for support witch leads to a whole brigade of minions and officers arive to the combat.

My suggestions to the developers is to let their games go through the process of QA much longer in their following games. And if the player is always gona have to face overwhelming numbers, then let the player be more powerfull, and or if he is supposed to have to flee from combat all the time, then at least make the camera less stupid and help the character instead of fightning against him.

To you players, I suggest you go buy Assassins Creed Black Flag instead of this game. Yes, Shadow of Mordor may be a LOTR game, but dont get hyped up, there has been and there will always be plenty of LOTR games that are bad, and in my humble opinion this game has not brought anything new that Assassins Creed hasnt. (And yes, Assassins Creed has plenty of flaws as well, but those I'll write on another thread)"

Another thing I disliked was the combat. It felt like all I was doing mashing the left mouse button and hitting each enemy in turn until they died while using the right mouse button to counter. Sometimes you will start a finishing move on an enemy where your weapon may be in there head, but then you need to counter another enemy and the first one is alive again.

+Good melee combat (I might contradict that for some soon)

+Nemesis system makes some enemies feel unique and you want to personally invest time and resources to kill some of them.

+Branding Uruk and turning them traitor might be one of the more satisfying experiences I've had in recent times.

+Graphics are not the best however they are quite pretty.

+The characters made atleast me like them to extents, and one orc was very comedic though cowardly.

+Satisfying perk tree to an extent, as you feel like you earnt the perks... Until they start all blending in and you forget about that awesome perk you got for that 30 sec unlimeted execution bs.

+Runes. Runes added a nice touch to personalizing your weapon, although not by much and getting good runes is quite random.

+That voiceacting though :D

Cons;
-Do I even need to talk about the last boss fight?

-Repetetive missions, some of which have incredibly horrible enemy placement, in the fact that most of them are easy but one dagger ""legend"" decides to be a pain in my arse with instadetection

-You can basically finish the game in stealth due to enemy AI being deaf.

-Nemesis system. Whilst I've put it in pros aswell, it is a double edged sword.  It spawns MINI-bosses whom can easily be way harder than the actual bosses by being immune to everything but for example normal slashes of your sword. And that takes ages to kill them with. One captain I killed over seven times, by decapitation, incineration, headshot, 'sploded his head, stabbed his spleen, made his brother decap him, poisoned him and finally killed him in a final great Nemesis battle towards the end with a normal stab ;_;.

-Story. The story ,even though fueled by good characters, felt rushed and incomplete. There were to few story mission, with few being incredibly fun, with the dwarf being ,imho, the best questline. The missions were quick and not very challenging, compared to some of the side quests or ""legends"".

-30+ seconds of god mode. Later in the game, you can with some ""ithrildin"" as it's called, buy one (or three) 30 second (can be more if you get the right runes) mode that corresponds to either your sword, dagger or bow. For the sword, it gives unlimited executions, for the dagger it's unlimited stealth kills and for the bow you can use a ""finisher"" arrow that sets shit on fire, or just shoot arrows forever. You can basically murder over 100 orcs with all three modes, and it's not that hard to get.

-Handholding you for the collectibles. I love to collect shit, but it has to be hidden. What you do in this game, is that you activate something called a ""Forge tower"" and then you can basically see any collectible or mission in a region of one of the two maps. 

-DLC. The DLC adds shit that shoulda been in the game. You can also buy EXSCLUSIVE RUNES. Yeah. You won't get that shit ANYWHERE else...

That's it for pros and cons, now here are some personalized thoughts outside of the pro/con.


Well... Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor... Where do I start? To be honest this game is infact one of which I enjoyed quite a bit,  However the fact is that buying it for the full price really isn't worth it. The only reason I didn't finish the game in 10-13 hours is beacuse I was jerking around killing stuff. 

Whilst the combat isn't horrible, and feels quite satisfying in my opinion, the fact remains that well.. It's quite like the Arkham games, and the second you get used to the combat the only enemy that is dangerous are the archers, but hey, you got a one shot bow ( you need to charge it up and get a headshot but if you have focus it slows down time) for them. 

Ranged combat is basically explained in a few sentences: Limited ammo, ammo drops everywhere, ""steal"" ammo from living enemies with a brand, instakill headshots, slow motion. It's not satisfying unless you use a perk that allows you to teleport to enemies and stun or kill them which looks bloody awesome imo.

The missions are fun but repetetive as stated before, and quickly get stale. There are a few that differ, but most are the ""legends"" for your weapons. I found the dagger and sword legends were the most fun, and the bow ones were just.. Okay. 

The nemesis system is good but as always with any RNG it has it's faults. Whilst it is of immense satisfaction killing a strong captain, when the system spawns someone who is immune to melee, stealth, ranged and mounted finishers and can INSTA kill me, it's quite BS. It dosen't happen often but when it does, oh lord it happens hard. I basically couldn't kill a cappie in the early Ûdun stages ,which is the first map, and had to get brand first to swarm him with orcs. ( spoiler He was harder than the last bloody boss /spoiler ) Some enemies just will not die at all, and others die in a second.

TL;DR Game is worth it, just not for the full price of 40€. I won't recommend it unless it's on a 40% or more sale.

	Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is an open world, hack and slash
style game told in the Lord of the Rings Universe.  Its style is reminiscent
of Batman; Arkham City and Assasins Creed.  The game in its 
graphics is professionally done, and reminiscent of the movies, but for
me began with a sour note by immediately advertising to buy DLC.  

	The story takes place timewise before the movies.  The main story is
high quality, but very short.  You can complete the main story in about
2 hours.  There are no side quests, instead there are  challenges  that
take away any emotionally connection bye sending you on fetch quests that
have nothing to do with the story.  

	The combat, while fluid, is also very basic, requiring little in
tactical skill, and rather a 'wash, rinse, repeat' style of play.  Click your your
mouse, wait for the parry, click the mouse again.  Click the mouse again.
The increase in combat moves is directly tied into your abilities, and 
unfortunately you have few options in moves and once your abilities have
been increased drastically, which happens fast,  all of your enemies
become easy to kill.  

	When you start the game, you are thrown into this huge world
with little to no guidance as to how to navigate it or what to do.  Your first few
starting mission leads you to kill the hardest enemy that is supposed to be in the game, the War Chiefs. If you are able to do this, the game sabotages itself by making all the rest of the enemies simplistic compared to that first few missions.  

	One of the games features is a nemesis system, where an enemy
who kills you will remember and taunts you when you come across them 
again.  While this is a good idea, that enemy never hunts you, ambushes
you, or does anything to seek you out throughout the gameplay.  Instead,
you may happen to come across them during a challenge mission, or as you are wandering around, which is unlikely.  This falls short of a true nemesis, and is disappointing as you can turn around and leave the area with nothing to lose, as there are no stakes on the table.

	Most upsetting was that while the world is huge and open, and you 
take on missions that should imply progression in your 
experience, yet nothing you do in the game matters.  Enemies respawn in 
record time, and the interaction of the world is not tied to any sort 
of epic battle sense or sense of accomplishment. There are no large scale battles, sieging, or even leading forces against other war chiefs, nor taking any land. 

	This game had a lot of potential to be something great; to have
epic battles and really feel a sense of accomplishment by sieging a 
castle, for how cool would it be to do such while riding into battle on a mount.  Instead, it castrated itself by taking out any depth of combat or impact on the world around you. It takes away any sense of satisfaction by having nothing ever gained. The game is beautiful and flashy to watch, but less then entertaining to play, as there is no point in ""conquering"" all enemies or the world.

Good things first:

Graphics looks nice.

Ok now the bad ones:

Environments are boring. Small empty maps with absolutely no activity, no NPC's, no variation - just fight an endless hordes of orks. The Far cry formula would've worked better i think.
Story mission or side mission it's almost the same. You must kill the specific ork and repeat it for another 200 times throughout the game.
The game doesn't feel finished, it feels more like a challenge mode where orks are teleporting to you and you fight them until you die/run away and see how long can you last.
The game has no difficulty setting. It would be ok if the game wouldn't be insanely hard. Orks are swarming you, 5 warnings pop out at the same time to press a button to counter and it's impossible to do.
I was fighting a warchief, took most of his health and he started to run (as always), i caught him while riding a caragor, knocked him down and when his health was down to ~10% he just replenished the health to 100%. Seriously? Even dark souls is probably less difficult.
Ok another example of how cheap this game is. You get a challenge stealth kill 10 orks in some some small location. You kill two of them (the easiest ones), run 20 meters to any direction, turn back and they're already respawned.
Aaaand the third example. I'm chasing the warchief, almost caught him and he suddenly disappears and respawns in other location with full health.
Sorry but i can't play such game anymore.
I just can't say anything good about this game. It feels like a quick cash grab made without any effort using well known name. I have played LEGO lord of the rings and it was much MUCH better game.

You play as some typical stock pretty white boy who does nothing but kill orcs throughout the entire game in various flashy and fancy ways. The end....

But honestly, the entire map is open to you from the very beginning so there is little sense of progression in that regard. Towards the middle of the game you start off with a new map and, guess what? You do exactly the same thing you were doing in the first map....There are no buildings to enter and there are barely any caves to explore, there are no towns to visit and there is no downtime in the taverns, there are no people to have a conversation with, there are no hobbits, no wizzards and no elves, there is just orcs and more orcs....there are some big orcs, some small orcs, some four legged orcs....and then some more orcs, well, there is also Gollum for about 10 minutes of the game.


Although you may feel overpowered at first, eventually you will start getting killed when you take on orc captains and war chiefs with their fellow orcs respawning by the dozens; and they won't stop respawning until either you die and respawn or until you kill your target.

If you plan on playing without making bonfires explode, dropping bee hives, and/or riding caragors then think again. You NEED to exploit those things when you get swamped by dozens of orcs while trying to kill an orcs captain. And that is as far as the environmental use goes in this game....

Another thing about respawning. Ever play an MMO? If not, let me break it down, you kill some enemies/animals in an area, you come back there minutes later and the same NPCs have respawned. The result? you get very little, if any, sense of accomplishment. This game operates the same way. It's like a single-player MMO in that regard. You beat up and kill some orcs, you free some slaves. Minutes later the same orcs are again in charge of some slaves at the same location.

WHY? WHY? WHY?

The only way this game could have worked is if it were made into a more linear experience with a better story. Think of Arkham Asylum. The enemies took awhile to respawn, and they did so only in certain areas and that was based on your story progression. The entire map was not accessible to you. You had to really work for your upgrades. Here, upgrades are given away like candy. Realistically, here you could advance to your maximum level if you simply engaged small groups of orcs without advancing the so-called ""story"" (more, or rather less on that later) and by killing the captains whose power you take; eventually, you would get all the upgrades (but not your weapon runes - those come from killing the captains).

In Arkham games the bosses meant something, they had their stories and peculiarities. Here, the bosses simply want to advance higher in the rank; they are slightly more difficult to kill if you fail to kill them at first and/or if you kill their opponents; AND they have their own strengths and weaknesses. And by strengths and weaknesses I mean being or not being afraid of fire/caragors; being or not being immune to ranged attacks, stealth attacks, and not much else.

The nemesis system is a cool and unique idea on paper. However, when you realize there is an infinite supply of randomly generated orcs to take place of their fallen comrades/rivals and when you realize that you are pretty much immortal then we have a problem here. Although the cool thing is that no replay of the game is ever the same. But I doubt anyone would be replaying this game. We were also told that we would foster these personal vendettas with the arch-nemesis orcs, however these will only extend to the familiar orcs saying things like:

""I enjoy killing you over and over again""
""Why won't you just die?
""You ran away last time but not this time.""
""I had to retreat last time but this time I am much stronger!""
""I will make you pay for this scar you gave me!""


Story.... What story? There is no story here. You try to avenge your dead wife and son and you have an ethereal elf living inside you.



As for the positives:

-Fluid combat, maybe even more fluid than in all Arkham Games;
-Satisfying stylish kills;
-Stealth system is decent although sometimes orcs won't see you even when you are close. ;
-Fluid climbing system.
-The Graphics and the physics

All in all, I tried liking this game but it fell flat within the first hour."

Aside from that this game is not that great, and while I am glad I got it on sale, if I could go back and change my decision to purchase this game I would.

The storyline in particular is quite awful. If you are a gamer that places emphasis on the story of and immersion in a game, then do NOT buy this game. The story is also really short. The game is over before you know it, and once that happens there isn't much else to do. There is a challenge mode and you can continue killing and brainwashing orcs once you beat the game, but there is little point. If you want you can make orcs kill eachother and have fun lurking in the shadows or even have one warchief with MANY bodyguards, but it gets old rather quickly. There just isn't much to the game overall. It's over before you know it, and then that's it. I had fun playing it for a while, but I really don't feel like I got nearly enough out of it. If you have a different approach to gaming, perhaps a more casual play once in a while approach, then you might enjoy this game. However, I strongly recommend going with a different choice."

To top it off, when your character gets killed, the enemy boss get stronger - so I've lost more than 12 times against the first boss and can never defeat him now."

The good: It's combat system is straight from the Batman Arkham games with an archery system out of Tomb Raider. There's a good upgrade system. Couldn't really get any better in terms of combat except when riding on the Curagors. Steering the mounts isn't very smooth. 

The graphics are nice. The animated story sequences look like they're right out of the movies. The voice acting and score are also good.

The story isn't that interesting. There are moments of humor which were genuinely funny. 

The bulk of the content seems to be a series of repetitive missions that involve freeing human slaves from orcs, collecting herbs, hunting wildlife, fighting swarms of enemies, or accomplishing stealth goals. In the Batman games, the Riddler rooms and trophies were set up like puzzles. There were missions that involved upgrading your tech like gliding through hoops. In Middle Earth, you just slaughter hordes of orcs over and over and over and over again. 

The orcs seem to have a neverending and quick respawn rate, which grows tedious really quickly. I think that was one of the main problems with this game for me. It's like playing an RPG with random encounters every 2 seconds. The mobs of enemies the game sends your way is very large. One of the final missions I played before losing interest involved killing 5 orc warchief supporters by combat or ground kills only. That meant running into the mass of orcs. It's hard to focus on just the orcs you're after. Getting a ground kill animation finished before you're prompted to counter or get skewered isn't that probable either. Maybe I'm just not getting the hang of it, but I had no problems playing through all the Arkham games without getting this frustrated.

The Nemesis system is interesting. In the Arkham games, you could get intel on Riddler trophies. In Middle Earth, you collect intel to learn weaknesses of orc captains and warchiefs. It was highly satisfying to read ""deliver a charged headshot"" to instantly kill a captain and take him out. It created a deeper system of strategization. While a nice feature, it too was repetitive. You just keep killing orc captains over and over and over to gain power for new upgrades.

While the game managed to keep me playing for 13 hours, I simply found the game to be too repetitive and the story too bland and didn't finish it."
3040,3,0.4897,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","The game is just too short. I got through the campaign in about 8 hours (taking my time with side quests and random orc hunting) and had pretty much everything done in under 11 hours. While the gamplay is good the game itself feels incomplete, like their should be another level at the end, another teir of play where you get to face warlords who are more then just beefed up orcs, like more of the Saurons lieutents dark human guys, or even sauron himself. I mean if you're gonna make a game like this why not? The difficulty really slides towards the end and the boss fights (of which there are only a pitiful three) are anticlimatic. The game tries to be epic and dramatic but at the end of the game your still just killing orcs. You can turn warcheifs to your will but left with nothing to use them against outside of the extremley short lived scripted final showdown mission. I did like the nemesis sytem and the little details in the collectables. It's not a bad game but it left me totally unsatisfied. Wait until the price drops and the games released with all the DLC. Maybe then it'll feel more complete.

3042,3,0.5197,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I really wanted to like this game and on first brush I did. It is very adrenaline oriented and the combat is, to say the least, brutal. There is nothing gentle about the way Talion finishes off an orc or some of the other creatures that inhabit Mordor. Sadly, like all games of this ilk, Shadow of Mordor relies on creating tougher and tougher enemies that grow in numbers. As you get more powerful, the game makes that progress pointless by introducing enemies that are now immune to the abilities you worked so hard to unlock. Then they add larger and larger groups of bad guys that eventually just become a neverending stream of them. I know that it is supposed to be ""challenging"" but it ends up very frustrating. I suppose that if all I had time to do is master how to play this video game, I might like it more. 

I thought the boss progression aspect of the game was interesting and had the potential to be well done. It is interesting to see how boss monsters might begin on the same level of the character and progress from there based on how successful the character is. There was some frustration there too; nothing like running across a boss fight moment after starting the game. Worse was jumping off the first tower the first time, I was confronted by no less than six bosses and their retinues. Still, I had a lot of fun with that.

My suggestion to any developer who makes this sort of game is to include a custom game mode that lets you choose which elements you want in it. If I could get rid of (or at least vastly reduce in number) the number of shield bearers in this game, I might actually finish it. As it stands, I see no reason to finish the game. There are still parts of the map that are unlocked. I can only imagine how frustrating the combat is going to get if I pursue it any further.

The story has great potential that is wasted on scraps of unlocks that you hunt for over the map. While not inherently bad, I play any game to get a good story out of it. Wandering around through hordes of respawning enemies to find that next piece of the story is just not worth it to me. Your few vocal interactions with the elf spirit get very tedious, very quickly. Other interactions are extremely limited. I don't have that feeling of versimilitude with this game. I feel like I am playing an arcade game.

Based on my gaming style and desires, I would not recommend this game. There are other games out there that scratch the fantasy itch far better. If you absolutely love the Assassin's Creed/Arkham series, then this game might be for you. I much prefer a game that shows me some sort of meaningful progress and impact upon the fictional world."

The game started out promising, the story (ofcourse), plot, initial cut scene and background, this later was dissolved by what seemed to be a frustrating gameplay of mouse-bashing. I can almost guarantee, my wireless mouse battery had taken a major hit since SoM. The re spawn rate of the Uruks and their captains is phenomenal.

There was a city which i literally cleared out, only to witness before I exited 50% of the Uruks have resurfaced, on the way out of the city, more seem to be re-spawning and heading towards the city. There is no break, no relief, it's constant mouse-bashing with hardly any skill requirement. I understand we're in Mordar, but the gameplay was just stupid as you just spent the entire play mouse bashing Uruks.

Mouse Movement was another failure, im not sure how this panned out on Consoles, but you can increase your sensitivity to 10000 and still get areas of movement where you need a 10ft mouse pad to cater, while other movement seemed to confirm the (hypothetical) 10000 sensor setting

Various ""Power ups"" were useless, one was that you can viciously stab an Uruk with a dagger causing the fleet to flee in terror. I attempted this in various scenarios only the group took one step back, then proceeded to attack as normal.

-fast travel and various ways to ‘get to where you’re going’ (get it cuz the guy’s dead)

Don't let the NO fool you, this game is actually not terrible.

The problem is, it's basically a Farcry 3 & Batman Arkham game, reskinned, with a buttload of bugginess.

The vaunted Nemesis system is certainly interesting, and held my interest for about an hour, before it became clear it basically serves no purpose but to burn/pad playtime.  Aside from the questline requirement, and to unlock the skill tiers, it basically exists as padding, which is disappointing that this wasn't fleshed out more (for instance, this is truly a missed opportunity with regards to Vendettas, as there's no real tieback to the original player even getting a notification let alone any kind of impact to doing this).

To make matters worse, the entire branding/control aspect came in WAAAAAY too late in the game.  It needs to get introduced in the first 3 hours of the game, not in the last 3.

Ultimately, I spent a good (not great) 20 quality hours with this title, and considering I got it off Amazon for $20, that's a reasonable and fair price.  The problem is that 4 or 5 of those hours was spent fixing/working around bugs, dealing with half the performance of my rig due to being unable to handle Crossfire built-in cards, and general control based issues related to how the engine works (ie. mouse control scales with performance rather than all other modern engines).

If it drops to $5-10, this game is definitely worth the entry fee.  Otherwise, wait a couple more years for the devs to fix what amounts to a buggy reskinned copy of better games.

During combat, you'll see button prompts to parry attacks. Other attacks need to be avoided. The prompts for avoiding attacks seem to never give you enough time, or appear off camera. During battle you need to constantly fight the camera to keep the enemies that need to be parried on screen. Even if you manage to see the ""avoid"" prompt, despite pressing the a button immediately, you will just get hit. It only seems to work ocassionaly and the game doesn't give you feedback on why you failed even though you pressed the button.

Furthermore, the traversal controls really hurt the stealth gameplay. I frequently got into situations where the character decided to stick to a position instead of continuing to move, or wasn't able to perform a key movement I needed to perform and blowing my cover. Then you have to try to get back into cover again but now there's a bunch more Uruks to deal with, all because the game failed to make it clear what I can and can't do to get around. One moment that sticks out was when I was perched on a bar with the enemy commander below me, stealthed, and I couldn't do anything other than press the B button to hang down. I couldn't even jump down. I couldn't do a death from above.

It's a cool open world setting, but the reliance on stealth, issues with traversal, and issues with avoiding attacks in combat make it really frustrating instead of simply challenging."

It doesn't even happen in real time, they just spawn. Normal enemies respawn practically immediately. So to sum it all up, gameplay consists of running around on a reasonably small map killing orcs.

I really, really like some aspects of this game. Combat is nice, stealth is fun, traveling the world is pretty cool, and your character can basically climb up anything anywhere. Nemesis system is cool, if a bit overrated IMO.

However, I feel like this game is bogged down for one reason. It's very repetitive. It's basically Batman combat with some stealth. That's it. Fight monsters and do quests so you can fight more monsters with slightly flashier moves. This is the whole game, and this does not lend itself to lot of replay value. I really want to like this game, and it disappoints me that the gameplay is this shallow. 

Like I said, the game does what it does well, but I have to question whether or not doing the same thing over and over again for 20 hours is worth $60.

The first half of the game is great, but by the second half, everything just bleeds into mind-numbing repetition: Stealth kill X Uruks, headshot kill X Uruks, free X Slaves, etc, etc, etc...

By the time you go to the second half of the game, you most likely will have already gained enough Power and Attribute points to have unlocked all of your abilities, with the exception of those that unlock from missions in the second area of the game.  This ensures that there is very little to look forward to on improving your character after the first half of the game.  

Speaking of missions in the second area, one of the biggest disappointments waits for you there.  You get the ability to ride a graug; awesome!  Well, no, not really.  The thing is clumsy and hard to control.  You are expecting to be able to go on a bona fide rampage on the back of such a beast, but no.  In reality, you  can kill far more orcs, far quicker on your own than with the help of a giant orc eating monster.  Sigh.

The only incentive to keep farming the orc captains after the first half of the game is to collect runes.  These do not seem to be adequate to the task though.  While there are a handful of interesting runes (a bow rune that gives you a 20% chance to have your arrow explode on a headshot kill, as well as runes that charge or prolong your weapon's special ability come to mind), most simply take a far back seat to the power of your Abilities.  For example: any and all sword runes that increase your melee damage under any number of conditions are fairly trivial when your Abilities grant you the option of instantly killing or branding two targets (excluding orc captains for the most part) after getting a x5 hit charge.  Why then, do you really care about what the direct damage of your sword is, when you only need to get in 5 hits, then can kill two targets?

Rune bonuses become even more sidelined once you unlock the special abilities of your weapons.  Using the sword as an example again, why do you care about the actual damage of a single strike, when your sword special ability gives you 20 seconds of unlimited executions?  The bow special ability of unlimited focus and fire arrows for 20 seconds is usually enough to kill any number of enemies outright, so who cares about a bunch of little rune bonuses that took hours to acquire from patiently leveling up an orc captain and then taking him out?  

The graphics simply cannot make up for this games lack of depth.  Save your money.

UPDATE 11/26/14:  Finally brought myself to finish the game...the Tower and Black Hand are the worse jokes of all.  Seriously, to fight the Black Hand all you have to do is press the space button a few times and left click the mouse twice?!  Really?!  Really?!  Come on...."

3093,3,0.5422,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Firstly, note that I have 21 hours in game.  This includes the time that I left the game running with the monitor off while I slept.  I believe the entire main story line takes around 12-15 hours to complete.  For a 50 dollars game, with a 20 dollar season pass, this is hardly a game I can recommend to any one who wants either 1) a decent story/narrative, or 2) a long campaign.

As most reviews state, it's combat mechanics are fluid, if stale and a call back to games such as the Arkham series or the Assassin's Creed series.  Shadow of Mordor was designed for console, and this is very apparent, from option menus, to the vary limited amount of inputs the game uses (E, spacebar, left control (interact), left shift (sprint), left click, right click, wasd).  If you are a keyboard and mouse user, and like to be challenged more than quick time events, do not pick up this game.  That is, by and large, what Shadows of Mordor's combat system break down into: a series of quick time events during which blood sprays and heads explode, and, if you are unfortunate, ""life saving"" events which require little more than moving the mouse and clicking the correct choice of spacebar, e, right click, or left click.  Having watched both console and PC versions of the game, I will say that to truely enjoy the gamewith any sort of difficulty, one MUST without exception use a gamepad, as this limits the speed with which the corsor moves.

What Middle Earth: Shadows of Mordor does, it does well.  The world is large with a host of orcs that truely make you feel as if you are not welcome.  The tidbits of backstory you can acquire via artifacts adds a bit of depth to what may otherwise be a very simplistic, and verging on lore breaking (If Tolkien stories are canon).  Combat is nigh frantic, though you often will feel yourself able to take on entire armies with little fear.  The branding system offers a unique take on progression, allowing you to truely conquer the land of mordor.

Shadow of Mordor strikes me as a game that 5  years ago, would have been top of the line from what we've seen.  However, with the advent of moral choices and branching story lines, Shadow of Mordor's story falls flat.  It's combat, while good, has been seem repetetively in multiple series.  Unique is it's Nemesis system, by which NPCs remember you from previous fights.  In fact, this is the most memorable feature of Shadow of Mordor in my opinion, which is disappointing as it is only a side feature.  

In the end, I can't find enough good to counteract the disappointment that is Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor.

Pretty disappointing considering hype and expectations**

On the wake of the big name this game has I purchased it, fortunately ,while on sale (25% off).

Graphics are simply the best on the market (Ultra with HD pack), yes, probably never saw characters looking better than in Shadow of Mordor, and the combat itself is fun....BUT:

The story is extremely weak and short, the gameplay is repetitive,  soon you will find yourself slaying a million uruks, and with everyone of them shouting the same phrase or close to (Space Marines Warhammer 40k style) again and again until your only desire is to turn the sound off.
After the million uruks massacre is done, you turn your back and there is another million uruks, exactly where the previous million was, and so on. Very boring in the long run.

Character animations, for dynamics, polished and various they can be, fall into some very clumsy transitions sometime: annoying during the frenetic combat.

Hunting bosses (Uruk captains/warchiefs etc ) is fun and adrenalinic, too bad they are frequently surroundered with another million uruks shouting ""Kill the ranger, take the ranger, grab the ranger, oh.. the ranger, look ...a ranger).

Long story short: 
During the first minutes of the game you have the impression to be at the begin of an epic, deep and polished adventure.
Epic feeling that vanishes shortly after playing again and again the same area, with the same endless enemies, with the same weapons.

Graphics (HD Pack @ Ultra) 11/10 - simply astonishing
Sound 6/10  - that could be 10/10 without the dumb uruks repeating the same things till your nose bleeds 
Gameplay 6/10 - very exciting and dynamic the first ten minutes, fall short after as incredibly monotonous
Story 6/10 - really nothing innovative or deep, stereotypical 
Interface 7/10 - polished and clean, not always intuitive though
Longevity 2/10 - Total lack of replay value, dull gameplay, especially if you have already spent lot of hours with the Batman franchise, with this game being a tolkian clone of it.

The game play feels sloppy, and more like a cut-scene with some QTE thrown in than any kind of fluid fighting game.

The nemesis system only works if A. run away from them B. let them run from you C. You die or D. all the above. You may have seen more but this is what I noticed. I was able to beat this game in only about 30 hours. In this time I finished all the hidden objectives (just to get a Poem at the end nothing more) all the weapon Legends (again a waste of time) to receive nothing in return but a way to waste time. I also took my time trying to make a massive army recruiting as many war chiefs and orc as I could. Thinking that like most the other middle earth games I have played, a epic battle of enormous proportion or some sort of real challenge to get to the end game. But fell on its face, it took me only 5 mins to beat the vary small group before boss and the end boss himself. Just to end as if it was the opening scene in a movie before the title. I have never been more disappointed with an ending like this God of war 3. I really did enjoy playing the game up until the end.

   If you still have not bought this game, I would recommend waiting it out until they are done making the games. I didn't go in expecting much because good games are hard to make. But if your going to make it a war like game, creating army's  to fight other army's then make an effort for the end battle to be bigger then any side mission you do to kill/tag war chiefs. Maybe add the Slaves you save to the mix, so you feel like saving them.

However, I can't in good conscience recommend getting it at full price. If you find it on sale for 10$ or less, sure; otherwise, there are far better ways to spend your money.

If I hadn't played any other video games in the last few years, I probably would have been a lot more positive about this one. But the reality is, I've played Arkham City, Prototype, Splinter Cell, and many other games Shadows of Mordor rips-off shamelessly. It is so blatant that it's just distracting. As a result, the game has no character. This is a game taking place in one of the best-regarded fantasy settings of all times, in the continuity of some of the most detailed fantasy epics in history, and yet, as someone who never delved too deeply into Tolkein's books (I watched the LoTR movies and liked them - didn't really care for the books), I struggle to tell you a single thing I learned about the world the game is taking place in, despite listening to who knows how many audiologs. I can barely remember any of the characters' names, other than the villains, and the villains are actually pretty good. The mid-game boss battles aren't going to go into anyone's best-of list, but they had a slightly different pace and had a good atmosphere. However, the final boss is just downright insulting. Without hyperbole, I can say it is the worst final boss fight in any game I ever played - I won't spoil it for you, but if you already beat the game, I can't see how you could possibly disagree.

Like I said, it's not a bad game. The nemesis system, which I feared would be a boring gimmick, actually does its job: it generates enemies that grow stronger and eventually become incredibly hard to beat if left unchecked. Sadly, the rest of the game is so easy that I actually had to let enemies become stronger to have any challenege, but it's still a clever mechanic that hopefully will be further developed by better games. And while controls aren't as tight as in Arkham, and timing is a lot more forgiving, combat can still be kinda fun. I'm also told the fan-service isn't bad. But it's all way, way too little. 

This game is essentially a cash-in on the LoTR franchise. It's pretty good for a cash-in, but it is insulting how little effort actually went into developing it, making a huge disappointment. I would suggest spending your money on any of the ""inspirations"" for it listed above - you would have a lot more fun for a lot less money."

The game consist of like 1 hour of gameplay copy pasted to last for 20. 

The main diffuclty when facing warchiefs is that they are surronded by 100 bodyguards and all of them rush to light the warning signal so that 100 more orcs can come at you at once.

3115,3,0.6644,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I don't really know what to say about this game. I played for nearly 20 hours, and it certainly didn't feel like 20 hours, but I'm not sure whether that's because I was having so much fun, or because there's not actually that much to do before you find yourself rinsing, repeating, and killing killing killing your way to the end. 

There's really 2 halves to the game - the half where you grasp the controls and prance around a rocky, muddy wasteland slaying anything that moves and indulging 2 or 3 types of missions; and the half where you prance around a rocky, verdant meadow slaying or brainwashing anything that moves and indulging 2 or 3 different types of missions. 

To be fair, I did enjoy myself for a large part. But it was upon staring slackjawed at the screen as the woefully anticlimactic final boss fight came and went in about 45 seconds (no, I am not exaggerating) that I realised that this game introduced one interesting game mechanic, rehashed a number of established mechanics (albeit well enough to make them functional and fun) and then offered nothing else other than a sandbox with which to exercise these abilities for as long as it took you to turn yourself to the main story. Which would be FINE if the story had a satisfying conclusion, or the sandbox didn't feel so much like a literal pit within which the developers had simply thrown some enemies leaving a lot of empty space with little else filling the gaps. 

I sound confused because I am. Monolith make well-designed and fun games, and Shadow of Mordor is both those things. But given that the review that convinced me to buy it stated that 'no-one could feel short-changed with the amount of content on offer', I felt remarkably short-changed. The Nemesis system is fantastic, there is no denying that, and it offers some of the most genuinely intelligent and dynamic enemies in gaming history. It truly is a gaming milestone. However, nearly everything else about the game comes from somewhere else - the parkour was better used in Assassin's Creed, the combat is straight from the Arkham series, the mission structures are ripped from nearly every open-world game in existence, the skill trees are old, the XP system is old, and on top of all that the enemies are practically deaf and blind...And it's this lack of true depth that left me feeling like the purchase wasn't worth my money. By the time I had finished playing, I felt like I had explored everything this game had to offer, and there was no reason for me to return. I didn't DISLIKE my time, but I didn't feel compelled to play again. 

I suppose I have been spoiled, because I bought Alien: Isolation at around the same time, and that's a game that left me feeling like I could play again and have an entirely different experience a second time around. I paid almost the same amount of money for this as I did that, and I don't think I'll go back again, which feels like a waste - like buying an $80 proof of concept.

In that way, I feel that Shadow of Mordor is like the first Assassin's Creed in that it introduces a fantastic concept (in this case, the Nemesis system), but the game itself exists only as a framework for that concept, and offers little else that the player can't get elsewhere. The issues I have are the same as with Infamous: Second Son, for those of you that have played: The MEAT, the things that you are actually given to do, all fall within 2 or 3 different categories, and all those categories involve killing a bunch of enemies that are fundamentally the same, and as such the environment becomes little more than a set of boundaries within which you can kill these nameless creatures, and your character becomes little more than a tool with which to kill.

There are open-world games, and there are open world games. Games like GTA IV keep me coming back because every time I play I can turn a corner and find something new. The beauty of the first two Arkham games was that the city itself had such personality that there was always something to see for those who cared to look. Unfortunately, I feel that Shadow of Mordor falls into an increasingly large pile of games that have a lot of style and little substance. Which is a shame because there is so much right about the game - the characters are great, the animations are wonderful, the voice acting is excellent, the action is gory and adult, the Nemesis system is truly a step forward, and the LOTR lore is explored in a really engaging way. However, after a short time the game feels repetitious, the environments feel big and empty, and the story ends as if the writer fell off a cliff mid-sentence and someone had to smash together what they thought the ending was supposed to be. 

I'd love to recommend this game, especially as it is evident a lot of money and hard work went into its creation, and for a cheaper price I absolutely would. But for the good of the consumer, I can't recommend it for full price - if this game were a bag of chips, the product would be delicious, but the contents would be mostly air."

Though death is quite forgiving in Shadows of Mordor, the game is designed so as to be an absolute misery if you don't have a natural aptitude for it...
> Every death sparks goblin infighting sequences, and if you have wondered (or blundered) the map a bit you'll have ID'd so many that these chain on & on.
> Goblin archers are king, so many a handle-able melee will result in death from unseen foes unless you have camera-wheeling FPS aiming skills.
> Caragors are basically killing machines until you advance far enough to trivialize them (kill in a single brief quick-time-event & can only be slain from 2 angled head-shots), so if you let one out anywhere it will roam the map randomly devouring you and NPC's without warning.
> Has the usual modern 3rd person adventure issue of piling endless controls on you in rapid succession.
> Bosses gain random traits as they kill you; completely random - meaning you can easily end up with broken combos like being undestructable outside of chain finishers while also breaking-chains every time they are hit.

I am certain this is a perfect game for many players, but I would really recommend doing some research before taking the plunge (not leaping at the licence) as if you don't enjoy this game you REALLY won't enjoy it."

Gameplay: Sub-par. 
Don't know if its becuase it is technicaly a port to PC but its controls are sluggish, inaccurate, and inconsistant.
You will frequently find yourself stuck on walls that you can't climb.
Sometimes refusing to enter windows, then doing so at other times.
In large engagements, you will rarely ever attack the enemy you want to, or a given ability will just fail to trigger.
Some enemies do not follow established gameplay rules/mechanics(of note is sometimes(seemingly at random) Caragors somehow killing you without the 'last stand' chance of recovery THAT OCCURES IN EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF THE GAME)
In general, every death will leave you raging at the game and some flaw in its controls. (or Caragors that cheat past established mechanics, ect)
Not a single death in this game did I think, ""Well, I just messed up there.""
Even when playing roguelikes, which are specificly designed to kill you in sometimes unfair ways, I felt personal mistakes were at fault and not the game trying to cheat me. Not so here.

As you have to meander around to find plants that don't really do anything special. They're just different colors on a map and heal you but they might as well have just made them all one plant type because it only matters to the sadistic programmers who'd like to increase the game play time by making you run around looking for different colors. 

The controls are probably good for consoles but the developers might as well tell PC players to piss off. If you're off even one step left or right you're screwed. The monster will hit you or you'll swing wildly in the air. 

You'll get stuck watching every ""special"" orc talk to you and waste time with ""I'm and Orc...evil and dumb. Now I'm going to kill you because I'm a big bad orc."" You can't bypass it and the fist few times aren't bad but after you're tenth interaction with them you'll start to run away just so you don't have to waste time with a really unimportant monster. Don't let them fool you the boss orcs do drop loot but aren't anything special. Just a little tougher and no matter how many you kill more just randomly generate.

3127,3,0.5941,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This game is the definition of mindless. Its story is uninteresting to say the least. If you buy it, just rush through the story missions and don't do any sidequests or any open world things, you WILL get bored.  The nemesis system is something that appears to have depth and at times can provide some fun, but once you understand how it works it's pretty pointless.  The game is harder at the beginning and gets much easier as you unlock skills and attacks.  There is no penalty for death, and dying is almost always avoidable by running away.  There is no point to killing the captains as they just drop runes you don't use anyway.  The graphics are nice.  This game is one of the most overrated games I've seen in a LONG time.  I would rate it probably a 6.5/10 if I to give it a number.  Due to me being 17 hours into the game (some might have been spent alt tabbed I dont remember) and just wishing it was over already, I simply cannot reccomend it.

Anyway:
-nice graphics
-low difficulty
-repetitive
-boring if you don't just do the story missions
-nemesis system not all its cracked up to be, and largely pointless in the grand scheme of things
-ADVANCE THE STORY, as that unlocks new enemy types etc... it claims to be open world but you must advance the story pretty much whenever you can

The combat is really quite decent, very fluid and fun button mashing, but the interjection of quicktime moments is often frustrating and senseless. The story is pretty shallow, the objectives, missions and world layout very much an arcade style which is pretty counter-intuitive in a lord of the rings game, but not necessarily a bad thing. There are some major issues with climbing/falling/dropping mechanics which can put you in incredibly annoying situations: the simple act of jumping off a ledge directly beside you becoming a major chore if not entirely impossible when in a cramped combat situation. This isn't exclusive to high ledges either, myself having experienced an 'invisible wall' scenario on a simple ledge maye 2 feet off the ground. I ran up onto it, about 10 Orcs ran up onto it with me, and none of us could get off again, invisible walls forming around this little elevated square of floor-tiling. Whie succeeding in this game is by no means difficult, and mowing down gaggles of goblins has its appeal, failure is rarely to never either a learning experience or amusing in the way failure sometimes is in a game. When you die, it's typically due to some frustrating scenario as described above, where buggy movement mechanics combined with having to chase fleeing generals who leap around the map at speed in circles while endless hordes of goblins pile up eventually induces a wild fit of carpel-tunnel with all the click-click-clicking, and you just give up. While the enemy promotions system is pretty cool, it doesn't help watching all these ugly figurines gloat and level up in the wake of your annoying death. While a well made game visually, Mordor is ugly, the Orcs are ugly, your character is ugly, I mean damn... even the LoTR movies had a smidgeon of elf-cleavage.

Because the ultimate goal is to either brand or kill the orcs, and doing so is just too easy. Whether the orcs are level 10 or level 20, they are just too easy to beat. There's no point of using the Nemesis System, and when you do, branding orcs and using them to betray/riot/etc gets repetitive: there are no strategies involved at all - it has become just a rinse and repeat formula.

Like most trendy gamers surely do.


THE GOOD:

- The combat is fluid and satisfying to say the least. It is undeniably the best part of the game. I have over 80 hours put into Shadow of Mordor and I can honestly say I never got tired of the combat. 

- The graphics and animations are very pleasing to the eye. As mentioned before, everything is so fluid and smooth. Even Talion sheathing his weapon after slaughtering a group of foes leaves you with a sense of satisfaction that is hard to achieve in games. (Or so it seems, since there is a huge lack of fluidity and grace in most games for some reason.) I may be a little bit extreme about finer details in games, but something about running around and climbing with your weapon always out, seems stupid to me. I like a game where you can sheath/holster your weapon and do other things. (Realism, perhaps?)

- Sound effects are, well, spot on. The swords clashing, the crunch of a broken neck or arm, the sound of a foe hitting the ground. All of it was fantastic. Voice acting was pretty decent as well.


THE BAD:

- Pretty much everything else. Anything I've left out of the ""GOOD"" portion, was pretty bad. (Obviously, right?) Wrong. They do a wonderful job of blurring out the bad, by showcasing the good. Once you become familiar with the glorious combat and things, you start to see the game a little more clearly.

- About halfway through the game I realized a lot of things. Here are some examples.

- There are certain parts of the game where the music made me feel a part of Middle Earth, like I was in one of the movies. They fail to keep that ship afloat, as most of the game has extremely BLAND music. 

- The story that was so very cool as shown in trailers, has really nothing new to offer. What you see in the trailers is what you get. I honestly can't tell you much about the story because it was boring and tiresome. 

- Character development leaves MUCH to be desired. I found Talion to be extremely annoying and whiny, as well as self righteous and entitled. (Not because of the loss of his family, just in general, throughout the campaign.) Most of the characters just simply never develope. In my opinion, Talion's wife had more emotional pull than pretty much all the other characters in the game. Which is sad, considering her tiny presence in the story.


THE UGLY (truth):

- Shadow of Mordor was a really well presented game. They had me hooked, mostly because I liked the first couple Assassin's Creed games, and I love Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. But like I said before, what you see is what you get. They don't leave much to discover after watching one trailer for the game.

- The hierarchy system is such a cool concept. And it functions, but the game is simply missing something. A lot of things actually. The unique personality of the orcs keeps things interesting, although you will see repeats of names, voices, dialogs, strengths and weaknesses. Once again, the voice acting is pretty decent, especially with the orcs.

- There are A LOT of things to be desired in this game. I have played Assassin's Creed 1 and 2, both of which are better, more complete feeling games. Here are some examples of things I found disappointing.

- To unlock more things on your map you have to climb a tower (just like AC series) but in AC they make a lot of different towers to perch on. You have to climb different churches, barns, castle towers, or simple lookout towers. To me, that was innovative and kept it fresh. Almost like a sweet mini game that doubles as a map unlock. Loved it. But in Mordor every tower is exactly identical. Had they not made the climbing in this game ridiculous, I probably would have stopped climbing and just blindly wandered the world. 

- Which brings me to my next ugly truth. The climbing in Mordor is terrible. It's more like flying up a wall, only to jump back down to ground level because there are rarely any buildings connecting to one another. The climbing is unbelievably fast and unrealistic. People that have played AC series should be disappointed in the free running in Mordor. I remember running for what seemed like miles, without leaving the huge city rooftops in AC 1 or 2. Climbing towering buildings for minutes at a time, it was a challenge in Assassin's Creed. In Mordor, it's more like jumping on top of a hut, then jumping down and running to your next hut. It's sad really. 

- Zip lines. Just.... Avoid them. They are the most frustrating thing in this game.


SUMMARY:

I could go on and on I'm sure, but I'll stop here and let you guys decide what to do with your money. Overall I'd say this game has a solid core combat system. Violence in Mordor is top-notch. Everything else is pretty disappointing honestly. I give it a solid 6 out of 10 because core gameplay is combat, and the combat is good. I feel the core gameplay is worth roughly half of the overall score. Thanks for reading."

To a degree it works really well, but you still have that climbing a wall whilst actually trying to run away or worse still , jumping in a completely different direction than you wanted to go AC frustration to deal with.

My problem is with the game  content (or lack of it) The side missions all appear to be variations of the same theme (or I've been incredibly unlucky) The zones (whilst beautifully rendered) lack any real content in an RPG sense ,and all tend to look the same. 
The orcs respawn far to quickly for my liking , meaning that a stealthy approach is fairly pointless. Inevitably you end up swamped by millions of orcs and  and find yourself needing to get away quickly (because of the health mechanic of only being able to refil your HP at plants scattered around the map) only to find yourself running up a wall or someother obstacle and dying.

I've tried to feel love for this game , but it's just not happening. For me.

The Positive:
- Killing Orcs in a cinematic way is extremely fun.
- Voice Acting is top notch.
- The enviroment is beautiful and since it takes place in Middle-Earth there is an excitement on seeing a well loved setting.
- The Nemisis system is really cool and can be used to create fun situations.

The Negative:
- The story is disjointed and confusing, throwing new characters at the player only to take them away after seemingly little impact on the game.
_ What is worse is the CONSTANT barrage of throw backs to the movies from thrusting a character, that has no right to be in the story, in your face to taking dialoge lines directly from the movies. It is frustrating and immersion breaking to realize that the characer's ideas are not their own but rather poorly done fan service.
- The chemistry between the Wraith and Talion (the main character) is aweful. Every time Talion says anything the Wraith, and everyone else for that matter, immediatly disagrees with him or throws what he said in his face. It was boring.
- The ending is, like the rest of the story, confusing and poorly done leaving a cryptic cliffhanger for the company to make a sequal or DLC
- EVERY SINGLE MISSION IS KILLING ORCS. There is no variety. Even when you save slaves you end up just killing orcs.
- There is no reward for completing the diffrent types of missions. This may be the most frustrating aspect of the game. It keeps track of your progression through all the diffrent mission types including ""building the Legend of your weapon!"" only to after finishing all the missions or collecting all the collectables to be given nothing. Your sword doesn't get a buff, you don't get a story for finishing a Moon Light door. Nothing. You just spent your time picking these things up for nothing.

If what you want is to kill orcs in a fun way than this game is for you. If what you are wanting is a continuation on the expansion of Middle-Earth with strong story and intresting gameplay this not for you. I can't recommend this game because quite frankly is fails to deliver a game I look forward to playing. There is no replayability as the story is weak and after you beat the game all you have to look forward to is killing orcs in more complex and intresting ways which is all you did in the rest of the game anyway."

Ok, later 6 or 8, still it`s crazy stupid.

AI is completely idiotic while I have a feeling that difficulty is artificialy increased (if I could say this way). So, instead of a Ranger with 20-25 arrows (then he could kill most enemies without H2H combat, as Ranger should!), we have very resistable enemies and 4 arrows. And this situation is only due to lack of enemie`s intelligence.
Ranger should have 20-25 arrrows. When he starts shooting enemies should seek for hide, then ranger have to come closer, then he gets attacked by enemies previously hidden.
Smart?
Not in this game. Here we have bunch of idiots, so their resistance to dmg is very high and Ranger have only 4 arrows. Why? Coz developers couldn`t program AI better, but they wanted to say that there`s 200h gameplay!!! Clear now?

The game starts out interesting, but gets repetitive and dense fast. Side missions offer no significant reward, are pretty much all the same, and seem to be in place just to add length to the game, rather than actual content. 
In terms of combat, you acquire very few abilities throughout the game, which makes the combat system get dull quite fast. 

As for the stealth system, it's pathetic. You can run up to an enemy, stab it while another enemy watches you, and he won't be alarmed as long as you get out of sight relatively quickly. Enemies will give up on searching for you after a very short time and won't be alarmed if they find a corpse, instead, they'll simply go back to doing whatever it is they were doing before. 

It is a well polished game in terms of looks, but lackluster when it comes to gameplay.

The game mechanics are okay, but the running and climbing feels very uncoordinated like the Assassin Creed series.

Fun to play for a couple hours casually, but don't expect a masterpiece."
3165,4,0.4827,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","This game mixes derivative gameplay elements with a gimmicky hierarchy system and tedious story missions. If you haven't played Batman or Sleeping Dogs this might be fun but its combat is far too similar to those games to feel at all fresh, and the open world design with quickly respawning enemies ensure that encounters quickly turn into messy brawls with dozens of enemies. The controlled, carefully orchestrated enemy encounters of Batman made for a much more enjoyable experience with what is essentially the same combat system. 

     Stealth is also fairly bland since you never feel vulnerable, Batman had guys with guns who forced you to remain sneaky while in this stealth is only useful for thinning the crowd or in story missions where it is made arbitrarily mandatory. Parkour movement has the same issues as Assassins Creed where you will get stuck on some objects or end up accidentally leaping off others if you pan the camera in the wrong direction. 

     Control issues are a persistent problem throughout the game as many actions are bound to the same key. Right click is used to aim your arrows and also to counter attacks. This is frequently annoying when you are trying to shoot down a orc running to sound the alarm, you will hold right click to aim the arrow but end up countering an attack. Space bar is also used for several actions and can lead to frustration when you want to jump over an orc during combat but end up climbing up a nearby wall instead. 

The hierarchy system initially seems very cool but doesn't really have that much of an impact beyond getting better runes for your weapons. The satisfaction of hunting down the bodyguards of warchiefs is lessened since the fights against them usually take place in forts where there are usually two or three other officers around anyways. Fighting a war chief would be pretty fun if they didn't always devolve into massive clusterfucks with enemies constantly going to sound the alarm. If you spend a lot of time killing officers to make a warchief fight more manageable and then die fighting the war chief, Orcs will be promoted and you will have essentially wasted your time since you will have to hunt down all the newly promoted orcs before having another go at the warchief. 

Some good ideas in this game but the gameplay needs a bit more originality and orcs should not respawn so quickly once you clear out an area. If your actions had any kind of permanence on the world, like clearing checkpoints in Far Cry 3, Mordor would be a much more interesting game."
3166,3,0.7108,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Straight up, this is the best game that takes place in the Middle Earth universe.
 Mechanics taken from Assassins Creed and the Batman: Arkham games are used well to give the player freedom of movement and the feeling of badassery in combat.
 The heirarchy of the Uruk captains and warbosses and their strengths and weaknesses added depth to combat and made you think about how to tackle the situation.
 Untill you could excecute your foes for 20 seconds srtaight.
 The absolute lack of anything challenging (except for the odd captain that was immune to pretty much everything wich seems pretty cheap to me) coupled with the never ending tutorial popups on how to play the game made for an experience that never let me take the training wheels off.
 It's a shame that to get a decent challenge one has to disable the hud and prompts entirely, probably leading to an unnecessarily frustrating playthrough. 
 Now my main gripe: the story. 
 It constantly amazes me to see developers miss the story side of their games. Tolkien created a world with so much depth, detail and so many well fleshed out characters as well as books where the story was robust and satisfying and devs seem to forget that bit.
 The story in Shadow of Mordor was so short and chopped, it was hard to give a shit about three quarters through the main quest. 
 But while I stopped caring about the main quest it was a joy to listen to. Excellent voice talent made everything sound vivid and alive. 

Final verdict? A fun game with a good use of existing mechanics and the implementaion of something new, ultimatly forgettable story and characters.

TL;DR?
The game is mechanically sound. The action is fun and engaging.
It's too easy.
The story was murdered.
Voice acting was superb.
WTF is the deal with that hunter dwarf? Like, why was he a main quest character. He did nothing for the main story.

Graphics: 8 - The graphics and textures are okay, but the weather is static and many things seem overlooked.

Story: 6 - Bad people killed protagonists family, now he pissed and wants revenge with some LOTR stuff in it.  Additionally the actual quests just seem very repetitive.  The game seems to be static in it's creativity.

Quests: 6 The game consists of a main quest line, and a series of very repetitive and tedious side quests.  The side quests consist of either killing orcs, which you can do anyways, and obtaining the legendary weapons.  I don't believe the legendary weapons actually make you stronger.  They just change the skin of the weapon, which is kind of cheap.

Gameplay: 5.5 The fighting system is a combination of mashing left/right mouse clicks and pressing space bar.  Many times during combat, especially with multiple opponents, I found my character facing the wrong way and running at random mobs.  And you can't loot anything and customization of your character is very limited.

One cool aspect though is how the orc captains are in a constant struggle to become stronger and gain power.  They gain power if they kill you, or you skip time.  I haven't seen this aspect in any other game I've played.

NOPE.

I played it the last 4 days, and I finished it with no problems at all, completed 100% (see my screenshots).
I found it very easy.. TOO easy, in my opinion.
I'm a fan of Tolkien's work (not a purist, I understant that this game is a reinterpretation ant nothing really bound to Tolkien's saga), and from my point of view the game isn't that bad, talking about the story, but nothing special. It's a predictable revenge-driven story arc.. MEH.
There are a few good references from Tolkien's saga, VERY FEW and nothing worth it. 
I liked Sauron pictured as an Elf deceiving the main character, and the little appearance of Gollum, but I would have appreciated if he had a major role in the game. I would have appreciated also some other reference, some other character appearence for instance, but nothing.
The mechanics are good, indeed, but nothing innovative.. 
I mean, it's like playing ""Batman"" without the Grappling Hook and with ""Ezio Auditore's"" stealth attacks.
The Nemesis Sytem is the good mark of the game. I liked to play with Sauron's army ranks, letting my little orcs get to the higher ranks. But even here there's a bad mark: the system is only useful in the main quests.. Once you get to the end of them (and I think it'll be too soon) you'll find pointless playing with the army generals.

Well it´s at least hidden behind good and entertaining combat animations and a variety of skills...
In the world of Mordor your death doesn´t matter at all, since there isn´t any negative effect if you die.
While sneaking, it doesn´t matter if your run across a bunch of orks or straight into them, they are either dead or you can run away before they notice you. If you want to escape you can just climb on top of any building or just run away without beeing stopped...
You are actually an invisible, immortal character, with bullet time on headshot island without ammo limitations and it gets worse as more as you progress.
The Story isn´t worth to mention, it´s worse then average for tolkien and told by simple cutscenes, but still... there was something that kept me playing for almost 40 hours and that are the sidequests, the little things you learn about the lord of the rings universe, the orcs talks and that you get alot of abilitys to test and play while progressing.

It's typical profit-making mass-market product manufactured by big publisher.  Really disappointed and even worried about aspects of this game.



Poor story(3/10) - Even high school students could write better stories than this.

Not just poor. Ragged Stories keep obstructing gameplay. 

Killing wife and son at the start of the game, it's too obvious and sloppy set-up. And that's everything you can see through the game. They didn't have to make more stories, cause showing off the death of wife and son in trailer movie was all they needed. Yes, this is profit-making product, and devs didn't even think about literary quality.

Gollum appears, find some treasures and good-bye, Hunter appears, do some hunting and good-bye, Outcasts appears, do some combats and good-bye. Come on, it's 2014 now. you can do better than that. Characters don't have any unique personalities and never intervene directly. As like other 3rd grade Hollywood movies, this game has poor narrative and lack of reality. It seems they didn't invested much on story writers, so every single stories are totally boring and tedious, even annoying. Actually I kept thinking about exit game for this reason. Totally ruined reputation of LotR.



Combat System (3/10) - Game difficulty is some kind of joke

I don't know, People who are not good at game may like this one, cause it makes many cool moves with just some repeated left clicks, but actually player does nothing in combat. Just infinite left click. That's all.

Enemies have poor AI, Can't even see you right in front of them, you're invulnerable to melee attacks almost everytime, you can easily escape from any situations, Archers can't hit you, and there're many more. Combat system may look cool at the start of the game, but you'll be bored after several hours. All you have to do is keep pressing left or right click and sometimes press space for 'dodge'. 



Boss Fight(4/10) - nothing to say

I'm not talking about warchiefs. I'm talking about middle and last big bosses (Was it called Black Hand or something?), Same typical bosses from typical sloppy story. Unripe, half-cooked Boss fight also makes this game much more boring. They have poor AI and poor abillity, and can't bearly hit player. There's nothing to say about boss fight cause there's literally nothing in Boss fight. 



Rune and Upgrade (6/10) - Doesn't make any changes in gamplay

I think I gathered about 80~90% of runes in this game, but it doesn't change combat much. I use some Drain runes now, but I think I could do just fine without those runes or upgrades. Combat is really easy and lame, and enemies have poor AI and can't hit you. Since you always can kill everyone with 1.dodge + 2.stun + 3. hit streak, you don't need any Runes or Upgrades actually. It doesn't make any changes in combat.



Nemesis System (6/10) - Actually does nothing

I saw many people talking about 'Nemesis System', but it's just a gimcrack, it's quite overestimated.(I think it'll be reevaluated later.) It doesn't have any systematic or inevitable role. I don't think people will remember 'Nemesis' after finish the game. It won't be remembered cause it actually does nothing.

You can kill every Bosses, War-chiefs and Captains with 1.dodge + 2.stun + 3.chain streak + 4.(animal or bug) with or without their bodyguards, and  it's ridiculously easy and lame. Sometimes War-chiefs or Captains will fight each other, but your decisions doesn't really make any differences. You can make your follower as a new War-chief, so what? It's same Uruk with different name, and It doesn't really affect gameplay and doesn't make any other strategic differences. Since there's no strategic differences, Nemesis System actually does nothing. In later game, You'll just have to repeat same(or similar) missions with same followers with different names.





I recently played Elder scroll, ESO, Wasteland2, X-com, Dark Souls 2, Assassin's Creed, How to survive, Borderland 2, Far Cry 3, Dragon-age 2. They all have some Pros or some Cons, but I haven't thought that there's any essential defect in those games, and I can recommend those games with confidence. Cause devs of those games really tried hard to make their game as a complete art work. On the contrary, SOM has no passion, depth, cultural values, literary values, or memorable features. It's just some souless product for mass market profit business. Only thing you can have is some action work which is copied from other similar action games (like Assassin's Creed, Batman, Dynasty Warriors). I advise you not to buy SOM. And I wish this game could be reevaluated later."

This is my first review ever. Please read and rate it as a review.



26 hours and 8 minutes, 100% playthrough. 51/51 achievements.

For such a [u]great[/u] game, that is too short playtime for 100%. I don't like the idea of games being unfinished when published. Game itself costs 50€ (bought it for half the price) and the rest is unlocked by buying a season pass or buying all the DLCs separatedly.

The game basically has unlimited amount of ""boss fights"" with the nemesis system. Once you face an enemy captain with a great set of strengths, you're going to be screwed. Cutting casually through hordes of normal enemies is enjoyable up to some point. Facing a boss enemy who can actually kill you with one strike if you mess up gives me the vibes.

The good:
+ Nemesis system.
+ Gameplay is awesomesauce
+ Music
+ Nemesis system.
+ Graphics
+ Worked great with mouse and keyboard while I hated to play Assassin's Creeds without a gamepad.
+ Nemesis system.

The bad:
- Story
- Short main questline (though I wouldn't see that as that bad thing when the story was mediocre)
- Clearly unfinished in my opinion
- The additional stuff starts repeating itself, bonus objectives counter that a little (I think I failed one bonus objective during the whole game)
- Out of lore monsters. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy battling graugs. I'm not 100% sure about this since I've only read the three LotR books and The Hobbit, but I don't think caragors, ghûls and graugs are part of the LotR lore. I had this feeling in the back of my head for the whole duration of the game.
- The final boss fight. MAJOR SPOILER WARNING: 
[spoiler] Hit spacebar twice, click Sauron's knee once. Watch cutscene. See credits. LITERALLY.[/spoiler]
Were they even trying?

I enjoyed the game. I wouldn't have played it for 26 hours if I didn't. I just wouldn't recommend it (especially for that full price) when the game feels unfinished. This is the first time ever I'm feeling like complaining about DLCs. I've bought Borderlands 2 season pass gladly, I've had premium for BF3 and BF4. Those felt like complete games when I played them. From my point of view DLCs should be supposed to add additional content to the game. Not to finish it or fix it.

In short: Great game, definitely worth playing. Just don't buy it for full price. It's not worth the money."

3192,3,0.474,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Firstly, my disclaimer, I liked this game BUT, I recommend waiting until it is on sale before you buy it.

If you enjoy Peter Jackson's LOTR universe, you will probably love the story, and the art. The character models are beautiful, though the bad guys get a bit samey, they still look pretty, there are plenty of hidden treasures to seach for which will flesh out the story.

But the simplicity of gameplay is what was the deal breaker for me.

Hack, slash, parry, hack, hack, hack, excute, explode head, rinse repeat.

I get what this game was trying to do, and I really admire its ambition, but it fails.

I beleive the goal was, you start off as some confused ranger with the ghost of an elf inside him who doesnt realise his true potential, and as time goes on, you build up your reputation, and your legend. Awesome, except. as this game goes on, it just gets easier, and easier and easier.  When I started out, I would hide on a big gang of Orcs for fear of being killed, but now I can literally walk into a massive encampment, wait for them to trigger their alarms, and just kill everyone in sight without getting a scratch.

The weapons, you get a sword, a dagger and a ghost bow. You can upgrade these with runes that you find, but again, this just makes the game easier as you go on.

In my opinion, games are only rewarding when there is some fear of the consequences of failure. Sure if some Orc (Uruk) powers up, he is a little bit harder to kill, but this is rarely a problem, because it is quite simply just too easy.

Captains and warchiefs are too simple. Find out their weakness, and exploit it. Scare them, then mow them down.

Play it, but just don't spend too much on it."

3195,3,0.3147,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I originally had some very scathing things to say about this game, mainly because of horrible technical problems. 

After some updates as well as a driver update, I'm now able to run the game at 60fps (capped frame rate) and so far I've only had one weird spot where it dipped. Which looks quite nice at 1080p with all settings at ultra, even textures. 

Now that I'm able to run it at the highest settings, I'm ready to speak about what I like and don't like about this game. 


Like: 

- Traveling through the game world is akin to Assassin's Creed. You're able to scale buildings, hide in bushes and jump off buildings. There also doesn't seem to be any fall damage. No need to find hay carts, it makes the traversal quicker and more forgiving.
- Stealth/Combat is a mix between Assassin's Creed and the Arkham series. You get a mix of Assassin's Creed assassinations, Arkham's takedowns and attack/counter system (with even the same two button combo for doing instant takedowns) and throwing daggers (akin to batarangs). 
- Graphics (when it doesn't crash the game) - The game looks pretty good at max settings. When you're caught in combat and nearby enemies are alerted, there will be a lot of detailed Uruks on screen at once. 
- The world isn't so gigantic to make traversal cumbersome and there are fast travel locations you can unlock. 
- The Uruk leadership system is interesting. The officers have strenghts and weaknesses that you can use when fighting them. 



Don't like:
- The problems with the Assassin's Creed world traversal system spill over here as well. Be prepared for frustrating moments where you try to jump to a ledge and you jump off the roof and land smackdab. 
- Be prepared for frustrating moments in combat like in Arkham when you want to do one thing, but you end up doing something else, or instant killing the wrong guy, etc. 
- Tying those both together, be prepared for some annoying moments whne you want to stealth kill an enemy.
- The Uruk officers just seem to show up at random at times. I'll be doing something and then bam, there's a captain. One time I was trying to complete an objective and several captains showed up one at a time. 
- Every Uruk officer has a little speech where they taunt, comment on a previous encounter, etc. It can get a little tiring. 


There's a lot more and I'll continue to write to this review as I have time now that the game is becoming playable and, dare I say, enjoyable now that it doesn't crash every time I open it."

Combat is fun and fluid but repeatative and new elements such as the bow don't add anything to spice up the formula. 

Graphically the game is very pretty and combat animations are excellent although running, climbing and moving around terrain feels very clunky.

The nemisis system is interesting. the orc army has a number of ranked captains all with various power levels names and weaknesses. Any random Orc that kills you becomes a captain you can battle them again later. Its a fun twist to give the countless nameless enemies you face personality but over all does not add enough to the game to mix up the encounters.

Graphics: Possibly fantastic, or so I've heard, but with my mere above-average rig I really couldn't tell. Both AC Black Flag and Arkham City were more visually pleasing to me, to be honest.

Gameplay: Borrowing from both the AC and Arkham series, the action is very stealthy/take on an entire army oriented. Take out a few from the dark and then engage on 100+ orcs. While that's good fun and all, it doesn't fit in with a game that takes itself as seriously as Shadow of Mordor does. Neither the stealth part nor the full-on action mechanics feel as fluid as their counterpart series.

The gameplay is a good mixture of assassin's creed and batman:arkham asylum, the story isn't that original but it holds it's ground, good voice acting and cutscenes and the same goes for the open world: not the biggest nor the most interesting, but it gets the job done.

The Nemesis System is the most interesting feature of the game and will entertain you expecially in the lower levels of the game.

Cons:

Scarce longevity: there isn't much to do beside combat, the main story takes less than 9 hours (if rushed, i took me 18 playing casually) and the nemesis system loses appeal after 15-20 hours as you get powerful enough to kill any captain without even looking up his weaknesses (capitans are level capped at 20.. not the best choice in my opinion).
There are not real sidequests, only small random challanges and collectibles with vague connections to the story that really are not worth your time.
This game really needs real sidequests and a richer map, features that will likely come in DLCs.

Overall a really entertaining experience which will last 2 days for the hardcore gamer and maybe a week for the casual one. I don't reccomend to purchase this now, keep it in wishlist and go for the first discount sell, when a few bucks less and a couple of DLCs will make it a real deal"
3211,3,0.6443,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","This is a game where I wish I could write both a positive and negative recommendation based on the type of player reading.  Since positives have been covered extensively, I'll stick to a ""should you buy"" negative review for people that are on the fence.

Shadows of Mordor's Nemesis system does one of two things:  creates incredibly memorable and emotional interactions between a player and his or her enemies, or it does nothing.  Unfortunatly, due to a lack of options to scale difficulty, there's very little that can be done if the Nemesis system does not work for you (enemies cap at 20 power and there is not a way to directly increase the difficulty of the enemies you face).

If you breeze through games with similar combat systems, specifically Batman (doubly so if you played hard mode and chose not to use upgrades to increase the challenge), or enjoyed games like the DSouls series, the Nemesis system will not work very well for you, even if you go out of your way to handicap yourself.  Without the Nemesis system, this game is Batman: Mordor without any memorable villians (since the nemesis system is supposed to create your villians as you interact with the randomly generated uruks).  It's still a mechanically good game, but you will most likely be somewhat disappointed.

That said, if you have played similar games and they weren't a walk in the park or this kind of game is completely new to you, the Nemesis system will create amazing villains and memorable unscripted moments."

3214,4,0.4787,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Middle-earth: Blender of Mordor seeks to anwser one age old question; Uruk, will it blend?

The problem with Blender of Mordor is that it starts as a very strong stealth game. Uruk and goblins are too tough to generally face down in open combat. Requiring you to stun them through a lenghty combo and then perform a finishing move with significant down time.

This gives the impression that stealth is truly the way to go and that the Uruk's genuinely have some strenght to back up their evil ambitions.

However by midway through the game this all crumbles. Earlier if you are either willing to grind or interested in the nemesis system enough to play but not progress. Then you will quickly find yourself going from a stealth action game to an over the top execution game. The skills are seperated in tiers of power levels. Five tiers in total, you unlock these levels by stacking up power points. Which are easily available through any randomly generated mission of the nemesis system. It's quite viable to grind to the fifth tier from the start of the game, but doing so will ruin your experience entirely.

The final tiers of power add skills to your arsenal that turn even the hardest orc in to mincemeat. The stealth element of the game becomes meaningless and time wasting and is easily replaced by the easily activatable instant kills. Not to mention special abilities that let you have infinite instant kills for 20 seconds... Augmentable to 1 minute 10 seconds through epic runes. And you get three of these skills... A sword buff which lets you spam sword executions, a bow buff which lets you teleport between orcs instantly killing them and finally a dagger buff which turns you invisable and lets you stealth kill spam.

So by mid to end game, you can easily walk into an Uruk stronghold and dispatch every orc that has spawned with literally no chance of losing. (since you are invincable during an execution animation and the game auto aims for the nearest orc if you spam the execution)

The nemesis system is a great idea but because the Uruk never actually evolve with you or gain new identities. You'll have easily seen most Uruk traits within the first few hours of gameplay. And the variance of these traits does nothing to lenghten the game past the story. Besides being an Uruk blender simulator.

The story starts out strong and interesting... Till the last chapter where it rushes you through two bosses and ends with a whimper.

The final boss is a quicktime event.

Conclusion: I had a lot of fun with this game at the start, but by the end the over dependance on easily spammable executions ruined any semebalance of challenge or gameplay depth. I cannot in good conscience recommend this game at full price. However if you can find it at a reasonable discount and are willing to give a fairly safe if occasionally inventive game.

There is little to no story, a very small map, and it seems there is only one thing to do- Kill or dominate Orc's. If I knew it was just a hack and slash game I would not have bought it. However, if you play these games to kill things, you will likely love this game.

I wish there was a better way to rate these games for what they really are so we can make more informed purchases."
3216,3,0.4844,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Having just finished the game I can say this:

The game was fun, I enjoyed it.

However:

The game lacked content, I know the game will be releasing DLCs, but really It's not enough to call this a full game. Most of the time you'll be dicking around trying to level up yourself and your runes.  But by the time you are leveled up, your runes mean shit, you just have to counter correctly and perform executions again and again. 

The only way to increase the difficulty in the game is to turn off the couter-attack prompts.

The Nemesis System is fun, for a while, then it gets tedious. Go to location, activate mission (Oh, you brought a mount with you? [b]WELL TOO BAD, THAT'S GONE WHEN WE RENDER THE INTRO CINEMATIC FOR THIS MISSION[/b])  It isn't all bad, I remember finding a character I had previously fought turning up while I was fighting a warchief. The best part was when he said something along the lines of me leaving him for dead, which was entirely correct. I had cut his head off last we met and here he was, standing before me with a scar across his eye. (Mordor's doctors are on point)

He then killed me.

But yeah, that was fun. But i suppose it's all gravy when you can never die and that isn't fully explored except for the fact that you're possessed by a wraith...

Which allows you to do super epic stuff, that no one seems to realise.  Most of the Story-line avoids the fact that this guy CANNOT DIE. 

Protip, just Brand everyone and everything. Then the game is piss


Cons:
Not enough Content.
Pretty easy
Lacks good RPG elements
Story is rushed through (I mean ffs, you have Tolkein's entire universe to play with) it wasn't gripping at all either
Not really open world, 2 areas that aren't exactly big.
Quick time events, this isn't CoD. 
Runes become useless
No end game content

Pros:
Looks good
Combat is nice
Brutalising an enemy is the tits


So to summarise, If you like pretty games where you know when and what to click so you don't die buy this.
If you're a fan of the series, it might fuck with your headcanon.
But honestly, unless they release a fuckton of DLCs that improve the overall quality of the game, it isn't worth it. Just another way to fill the cocaine bucket.

3219,3,0.5639,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is a tale of two halves; the pros and cons are literally split into the first and second half of the story respectively.

General Gameplay
Movement across terrain is fluid, and draws comparison to the free-running of the Assassin's Creed series. navigation is also convenient with the presence of fast-travel towers throughout the world. However, the world was smaller than I expected, with only 2 major regions containing several 'territories' of the Uruks. Also, the enemies respawn extremely rapidly, to the point where you can find enemies respawned at the spot you left just moments ago, making it gradually tedious to move around while fending off waves and waves of Uruks.

Combat
Reminiscent of the Batman Arkham series, with the counter button and combo stacking into combo finishers. Skills unlocked as the game progresses also bring another level of fluidity to combat, with the best example being Shadow Strike.

Stealth
Similar to how stealth works in the Assassin's Creed series; as long as the enemies are not fully alerted, even directly sprinting into them and finishing them off constitutes as a stealth kill. Mind-numbingly easy

Upgrades
Linear and straightforward. The game encourages you to balance your progression in both the main story missions and side missions, as the main missions unlock skills otherwise unavailable, and missions like Power Struggles incrase your skill tier levels. The runes for weapons also add a layer of depth to your weapon customization, supposedly. The reason being, chances are you're going to use the same few skills (eg. Brand and Shadow Strike) and runes (Epic Runes) for your character anyway, making the whole system pretty redundant.

Plot
Lacking in depth, the story is very generic, and is seemingly only in there because the game needed one. The worst part was the final boss. Seriously, when all you need to do to kill the boss is through the ever-so-stupid-and-hardly-understandable QTEs, you realize then that the storyline is just one hell of a screw-up.

NEMESIS
Touted as the highlight of the game, the Nemesis system could theorectically crete an infinite number of captains and warchiefs, each with their own  unique personalities, combat traits, strengths and weaknesses, and storylines. However, in actuality, most of the nemeses I encountered were not much different from one another.  Even when I purposely let go a particular Uruk several times and met him on the battlefield thereafter, he did not seem to have any more hatred towards me then the time we first met. A very novel idea with less than satisfactory application, the Nemesis system nevertheless would set the tone for enemies' characters in games in the near future.

Conclusion
It is definitely a fun and original game thanks to the Nemesis system. However, the extremely pointless storyline (completed in like 12 hours?), the ease of difficulty which makes you feel bored, and the all-too-familiar feeling that comes to you after a while of playing, when you realize that everything is actually very homogenous in general, makes this game unworthy of its price. I would recommend that you buy it during a sale instead."

Buy this immediately! 

I've not found a single player game to quench my thirst since Skyrim, and even that didn't live up to my Oblivion standards.
10/10.
The feeling you get when a Warchief bowls up...the fear you have when that badass mofo walks like a P.I.M.P and is taunting you. Amazing! At first you wonder how people ever die...then you remember this game has RNG, but not annoyingly, more like ""OH MY SWEET JESUS WHAT THE FUCKING SHIT OMFG THIS IS TERRIFYING"" And then you die to 3 captains rather than 1 because for some secret reason, these uruks wanted to join his crew. Now you gotta work 3 times harder xD

Utterly love this game, I don't review very often, but this is well worthy of all your money.

Edit: At around the 12 hour mark, this game became the same boring grind  that Assassins Creed games are. You don't actually have the freedom you once thought you did, everybody has the same character in the end, there's no real customization in the talent tree whatsoever.
I would not recommend paying full price for this game, a tenner might be ok, but if I could get a refund I'd go and buy Alien: Isolation instead, a shorter, but hella more enjoyable game with better immersion and storyline aspects."

When I first started the game the first thing I did 5 minutes in was go into a stronghold which is supposedly the hardest thing in the game, the alarms rang and I was surrounded and got confronted by 3 generals at once. And I killed them all until the rest ran away.

I proceeded to not upgrade anything because I felt the game was too easy.
It did get a bit harder when they introduced the new enemies but after 5 minutes I went to a stronghold and did the exact same thing again with all enemy types.

So it got really boring and repetitive for me, If there's no challenge there's no fun to be had. Nothing that you need to overcome and beat.

Otherwise it's a decent game, the Nemesis system is a really good addition to games, but it could have been executed better."

3237,4,0.4369,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Now, the next gen is here, and so is a review for Shadow of Mordor.
A, in it'score, flawless and nice game, with one of the most innovative mechanics I've seen in quite some time, but a presumable horribly DLC policy and a definitive lack of content to go with that.

Oftwn, ME:SoM is compared to Arkham (which is indeed it's engine-wise successor), Assassins Creed and similar franchise titles. And this comparison is correct, given it as well contains stealth, oneshotting enemies, fighting multiple enemies at once and being horribly overpowered.

The gameplay most revolves around doing quests, which always end up with slaughtering orcs in various manners. Which means, the game really needs a good combat system or will completely flat otherwise. Does it have that? Jup, combat is pretty good, exciting, and despite you being horribly overpowered, still tough, because the lategame captains will still kill you in 1-2 hits, so a single slip-up can spell doom (or well, a QTE where you can avoid the lethal blow, this can onlyhappen twice per fight though. And some captains execute you instantly).
Combat consists mainly of throwing out sword strikes (if you time it right and unlocked the right abilities, you can critical-hit with perfect timing, up to tripling your hit streak gain) to build hitstreaks, then unleash powerful 'finishers' every Xth hit, whcih can range from Jedi-Style Force explosions to sucking the life energy out of orcs (to replenish your spirit arrow ammo) or just plain old beheading. There aren't too many enemy types, but the fact that some are immune to standard attacks does mess you up alot in a slashpit.
So, combat is definitely accounted for, andit never got boring for me. Albeit I can see it becoming repetitive at some point.

Graphics are, probably next-gen. (I'm saying probably here because my 2 years old tower didn't even stutter whilst running them on high, I expected worse performance.) In anyways, they are not bad or lacking in any department.
Sound and voice acting is pretty good and despite the one or other repetive sentence there's actual a lot of dialogue from the Uruk's in the game, and often fun to listen, too.

The controls are not just as perfect: Whilst the game clearly can be played with Mouse and Keyboard, no problem, there ARE remnants of Console-developement, f.e. Multi-Binds that make SPACE your unviersal Sprint/Dodge/Climb key. In-Game these are usually not an issue, but sometimes I got stock dodging attacks instead of climbing onto a building.
HOWEVER, the way this game handles climbing is a bit... annoying at time. To clim, you just hold SPACE and roughly point out a direction with WSAD, the RAnger will gladly go superhuman and jump up pretty much anything. However, he is a snail when it comes to moving sidewards along ledges and often he will keep climbing even if you don't want him to. Dropping down from ledges is a bit flunky as well, and I had several moments where I would drop off a 2m-wall, climb back against it, drop down again et cetera.

Now, let's get to the core mechanic of the game: The Nemesis system.
And OH BOY this is one of the best mechanics I've seen in a long time. 
For those who didn't follow the hype and don't know the details: There are several Orc Captains, and 5 Warchiefs (per each of the two areas). These Captains all are randomly generated minibosses, which have a custom name, nickname, appearance, strengths, weaknesses and personality. F.e. you might encounter Urugal the Coward, who has pretty much every fear this game has and will usually desert any fight he gets into. Or you meet Rog'Dar the Slayer, who is a fearless murder machine which is immune to normal attacks (making him pretty much immortal amongst enemy Uruk, because yes, there is occasional infighting).
You can interrogate Informants which you single out in the Orc hierachy, which will reveal a captain's identity, position and his traits. Then you can proceed to murder the captain in the most efficient way possible, if you include all his fears, hates and weaknesses, you even get a reward by making the loot (Runes to customize your weapons) more valuable.
But it doesn't stop there. I still remember that time where I killed Craug the Raven with a simple lure-into-bushes-stab-inyoface, because he had stealth kills as a weakness. Somewhen later, I then was doing a time trial side mission about stealthkilling orcs... and suddenly, from a bush, I get jumped by... guess it... ""You think you killed me? In Mordor, better make sure your enemy is really dead""-Craug, now with a big hole-scar where I previously stabbed my dagger into.
And actually he even managed to trigger a Stronghold alert (infinte reinforcements until you hide) and then kill me. I would later on kill him on various occasions, but until I managed to behead him in one encounter, he kept being a persistanteannoyance that got stronger alongside me (and continously reminded me of how he killed me).
The Nemesis system continously generated dynamic power struggles, where the Uruk Captains fight beasts or each other (or just a barrel of grog), become stronger, and gain more diverse abilities. Towards the end of the game, I encountered a Strength 20 (maximum level) enemy who was so full of positive traits I actually needed four attempts to finally kill him, simply because he was immune to anything but melee finisher combos, but could drop poison cloud if engaged in melee and had a powerful spear that could oneshot me.
I could keep on telling you various anekdotes of what for  amazing Nemesis encounters I had, but let's simple summarize it as an excellent newmechanic that I hope to see in more games.

Now then, except for a slight dent in thecontrols, this games seems absolutely perfect, right? Well, there IS a big negative point:
Content.
The game does not offer you a lot of content. You got your 20 main missions, which could be rushed in a few hours. The Nemesis system technically provides infinite replayability, but the fights act out very similar later one, given most captains will have pretty much all abilities by them, give or take a few.
There's a lot of side-quests aka ""Slay 10 Orcs in manner X within 1 minute"", and a few stealth and even some gather-herbs missions... But unless you'Re a completionists you won't really feel the motivation to do those (especially not the abundant free-slaves missions, which are all the same).
In the end, I must conclude that the actual amount of content offered, for a 50€ priced AAA-title is horribly lacking.
And to add another one onto that, they already offer season passes and DLC with additional content... which kinda makes me think they intentionally cut down the content on the main game to entice people into spending even more money.

And this brings me to my review result:
Is the game good? Yes. Is the game worth it's money? Probably not.
I've gotten it for 28€ on MMOGA and I'm a bit grumpy that I didn't even get 20h out of it. There are just too many 'cheap' titles that provide vastly more playtime to see that as an acceptable ratio.

Result: 7/10
Exceptional gameplay, but a lack of content makes this a bit of an overpriced oneshot. Wait for a sale, then grab the title, and you will enjoy it much more."
3238,3,0.5971,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","While I don't have the most remarkable skills in terms of expressing myself in written form but nonetheless I feel like I have a couple of things I must tell potential buyers. 

So first things first, how are the story? Well, the intro provides you with Talion's motives for his actions in game but little to establish him as a character which makes it a little difficult to connect with him while embarking on this journey with him. Following those events, you are then introduced to a variety of characters (all of which seem to be better developed than our protagonist(s)  ) some of which feel like they are simply tacked on to move the plot forward. I'll stop there to avoid spoilers, but the story feels very under-developed and rushed. You will most likely that they have betrayed the original establishment of Talion's already un-relatable character, with that last scene. Like everyone has mentioned, the final boss is a piss poor excuse of a boss. You will find more challenge when fighting Warcheif Bodyguards.
After 5-10 minutes of that you are introduced to your companion in death, who will aid you in your path to vengeance and salvation. When this introductory portion of the game finishes, you are placed in the first of 2 areas that you will be exploring and this is perhaps the first flaw/problem of the game. I felt like I was just sh@t into this environment and was expected to just know where and what to do.  
At first you may feel a little confused as you are put in the middle of a couple of orc camps and with what felt like no rhyme or reason. You are not told how long has passed since the events that we just witnessed if you are in the same location or not. I quickly found myself surrounded by 3 captains (the lowest rank of the orc nemesis system) and I dealt with them with relative ease, thus I managed to max out the first line of ranger and wraith abilities within 1.5 hours of playing (without aiming to do so) and Talion's strength quickly started feeling overpowered. However as the game progresses you are introduced to several different non-captain/bodyguard/warchief  enemy types, 3  I believe, that require different  tactics to defeat... or be that they can't be simply auto attacked and need to be stunned first, making the hand to hand combat relatively monotonous. I've seen people praise it as it successfully clones the Batman Arkam series, however for this type of game, I felt that the lack of combo variations and fighting mechanics left me desiring more and somewhat annoyed. As the game progresses more (story-wise, as this is the only way you unlock the new abilities that matter) you will quickly realise that this game is meant to be played mainly in stealth as that's where you will find the most variation in dealing with enemies (this becomes a problem however) and they are in fact very fun and satisfying to pull off.
As the Uruk ladder of command is fully introduced and you are free to do as you please (prior to getting branding) it can be very irritating to deal with enemies that are above captain level as they become pretty much invulnerable to everything other than finishers, which are used to weaken and eventually kill the target. You can often find yourself gang up on by all sorts of enemies when hunting for a specific target (Uruks of the same or higher rank) which adds challenge, but feels very cheap as rather than the fight between those two being difficult, you have to deal with the increased number of Uruks that follow, and this in turn shines a bright light on the flaws of the melee combat system. Since you have very little effective AOE abilities (you are better off using finishers as the AOE you get feels like it does 0 damage to anything that isn't a ghoul). This can become especially frustrating if you are hunting a captain level Uruk and then 2 bodyguards, their warchief and 2 more captains end up in the same location, as you will be rushed with what felt like a zergling rush of Uruk grunts.
After completing 85% of the story you get branding in its entirety (if you get the ability at first and you want to prolong the game's life, I advise you to do 1/2 more missions as you are not given complete control at first) and this does make the game a LOT more fun, but again it feels somewhat incomplete.  While you have a decent amount of control over high ranking Uruks, you have NONE when it comes to the grunts. Without going into too much detail, something as simple as directing all branded grunts into one location is not possible, so if you want to create a mini army to face the literally infinite horde of orcs high rankers can summon, they will only attack any enemies that come near their location, the only control you have over then is making them hostile (attacking regardless of whether or you not have been engaged in battle) so it feels rather pointless in that regard.
I want to quickly mention the leveling system. You can level your weapons, wraith and ranger abilities, and your resource pools/rune slots. While the Ranger and wraith powers you get have a decent variety and are all useful in their own regard, the weapon ""legacy building"" seems like something that was tacked on to add a level of depth that isn't really there. All the runes that I have gotten have been more or less completely useless, and I feel like I've completely wasted resources in getting more rune slots for each weapon. Most (95%) of the runes I've gotten had to do with a small percentage of resource generation on kill so just the one on each weapon will do the trick. And while you have all this fluf, after you get 1 bow ability most of this leveling becomes obsolete as Talion becomes completely overpowered being able to one shot anything up to captain level (who don't have the ranged invulnerability sh!t).
After completing the rather short story (which can be done in give or take 5 hours if you don't slow yourself down on purpose)you feel like you have accomplished everything this game has to offer (even branding wise.....) so your only reason to return to this small ""open world"" is to complete any challenges you may have missed along the way if you are a completions or to maybe try out one of the previous story mission objectives again.

{Edit} While on the topic of missions, one thing to note is that they are not dynamicly activated. This means that you have to walk to location A see the Tron like beam, and press L-Ctrl to activate it, which completely break any sort of in game immersion.

To conclude I would like to mention that the game was fun while  it lasted, but I feel like there is little replayability to it, as the lack of difficulty settings to a VERY easy game make it rather unappealing to do so. The technical aspects of it like sound, graphics are great, although the required specs for ultra seem a little odd considering the texture quality of the game. Personally I would recommend you get this game when a price drops comes around, as the nemesis and branding systems are something worth playing and I would love to see it applied and fleshed out more in future games. This is my first ever game review, so a thousand apologies if it felt like I jumping from thought to thought, or it was poorly structured. Hope this helps :).

3263,3,0.3818,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","“Shadow of Mordor” isn’t bad, exactly. It has all of the components that one would expect from what passes as a statistically “good” and “successful” game: a brooding white male protagonist with a vaguely defined score to settle; an open world filled with parkour opportunities and tons of collectables; tons of nondescript, brown enemies to slaughter in increasingly brutal ways (so you don’t feel bad about it afterwards); and a plot that, much like the plot of a porno, doesn’t really interfere with the carnage in any meaningful way. It’s almost like the developers at Monolith took a look at all the successful franchises from 2007 on and were like: 

“OK, so: Bioshock, Arkham, Assassin’s Creed, Call of Battlefields. Aaaaand break!”

A good idea in theory, but the practice of it is a bit bizarre at its best, and deeply confusing at worst. The primary issue is that, like in the case of Dr. Frankenstein, the execution falls far short of the premise: if you pilfer the most successful franchises only for their choicest, most successful bits, you’re still going to end up with a monster. Granted, it’s a really sexy, entertaining, and occasionally fun monster, but it’s still kind of a freak of nature that you wouldn’t want to appear in public with for any extended period of time.

The biggest sin “Shadow of Mordor” commits is that it never properly makes the successful elements cohesive with the game’s central objective. As I briefly stated before, the plot of the game revolves around the ranger Talion, whose wife and son are murdered by retroactive continuity before he takes his final breath. Talion wakes up to find out that he is being denied death by an Elven wraith (spoiler alert: it’s Celebrimbor, the master smith who forged the rings of power), and immediately the story takes a spinning somersault onto the cuckoo train. Mental note: having Celebrimbor just make an appearance in the afterlife to some random human and endow our protagonist with magical powers would be akin to Jesus waking a Buddhist from death and favoring him with the power of starting crusades. It’s interesting in theory, but makes no damn sense in practice. Anyway, this unlikely alliance results in a lot of wall-climbing, free-running, and shanking Orcs from high ledges, sort of almost exactly like in Assassin’s Creed… except when Talion also fights enemies in head-on rhythmic combat like Batman. Anyway, plot happens, Uruk get stabbed, Gollum makes an appearance because Lord of the Rings, and so on and so forth, until you literally kill every damn thing in Mordor at least five times over. Mission accomplished, hurray America. Er, Gondor.

I totally meant Gondor.

The funny thing is, the longer I played through “Shadow of Mordor,” the less time it took me to realize what exactly didn’t make sense about what would otherwise be a pretty successful formula wrapped in a bare-bones plot. The gameplay elements, while totally functional yet unpolished (more on this later), made sense on their own. I couldn’t, however, for the life of me, figure out where any of them fit in within the greater scope of the game or with each other. Take the parkour component: it totally made sense in ”Assassin’s Creed II,” where Ezio could run roughshod over tightly packed and densely populated Italian cities and we, the gamers, could indulge in borderline pornographic shots of historically accurate reconstructions of landmarks which we, to this date, can still visit. There was a kind of unprecedented joy I derived from scaling Giotto’s Campanilla, or climbing my way to the top of St. Mark’s in Venice, and I suspect this was largely the case because in real life, there would be no way I wouldn’t get arrested and thrown out of Italy for that sort of activity. By contrast, the Mordor that Talion inhabits, by contrast, is a barren and boring landscape punctuated by a few roving bands of 3-5 Uruk Hai and the occasional stronghold that serves no purpose but to house a potential mission or a war chief. There are no interesting free-running puzzles to solve. As a result, traversing the landscape between missions is a dull affair, and more often than not I found myself resorting to fast-travel just so I could get the tedium out of my system.

On the topic of war chiefs, by the way, this is yet another thing that Monolith dropped the ball on. The idea was that all the Uruks in Mordor are constantly trying to one-up each other in an endless power struggle and curry favor with their dark master by overpowering or backstabbing their competition. The idea of a power struggle among Sauron’s Finest is interesting in principle, but it is pulled off in the most clumsy and uninteresting ways: the extent of the power struggle takes place off-screen and is resolved through what is essentially a glorified series of 20-sided die rolls. The combat against war chiefs is easily exploitable, provided you manage to catch them one-on-one; if, however, you have the misfortune of getting ganged up on by several of them, you’re almost certainly going to stare at the business end of a loading screen. And yea, verily, while it can be fun and occasionally rewarding to exploit the war chiefs’ weaknesses, it’s equally easy to engage them in head-on combat. 

The combat, coincidentally, is yet another issue that the developers clearly didn’t think enough about integrating. The idea of free-flow combat, so smoothly executed in the Arkham games, is definitely a good direction for a combat-heavy LotR game, but the execution is, once again, lacking. There’s just something off about the timing and the delivery of the button presses that makes the whole thing into a button-mash fest rather than the meticulously timed, rhythmic affair that it was in the Rocksteady games. I’m honestly not sure if it’s the Uruk-Hai AI to blame, or the coding of the actual combat module, but enemies often clump up, making it difficult to distinguish a parry from a dodge. Similarly, predicting the enemies’ attacks often results in resetting one’s hit streak, as charging orcs will often forget why exactly their scimitars were raised at the ready and stop dead in their tracks before unloading the full fury of their attack on Talion. The combat thus becomes that weird mix of easily exploitable and frustrating, completely undoing all the positive aspects of Rocksteady’s progress.

Also, and this may be purely intentional on the developers’ part, there’s really no clear break between the stealth and head-on combat sections. Like, none. You just go from one to the other, and the whole thing feels like an episode of Laurel & Hardy, as you lure idiotic Uruks away from the pack, but are then tripped up by poor stealth mechanics and have to change your tactics from low to high profile and charge headlong into a group of the buggers. 

The sad thing is, all of this complaining above isn’t even ten percent of what’s wrong with the game. And I could go on. I won’t, but I could. The point is, “Shadow of Mordor” is definitely a forest-for-the-trees scenario: it’s awash in good ideas turned bad through implementation, and what could have been an entertaining game gets some serious points deducted for trying literally everything at once and, predictably, failing. My advice to anyone interested in picking up “Mordor:” all “Assassin’s Creed” games are on sale right this second. Go get a copy of Ezio’s first adventure, then spend the five bucks on a copy of “Arkham Asylum” (or ten if you prefer “Arkham City”), and top it off with a detour through the sparsely populated wasteland that is Tim Schaeffer’s underwhelming “Brütal Legend.” The combined cost of those three titles will still set you back less than fifty dollars, and you will still get more entertainment-to-dollar ratio out of those three titles than you would if you purchased “Mordor.”"

Hm what can I say about this, as a person who has played A LOT of open world RPGs and expected something new and innovative from this, I am also a huge JRR Tolkien fan so I couldn't wait and bought the game for 50 bucks right away. 

Additionaly I have to say I don't like the way games are being made recently (you buy an expensive base game with less content and need to buy several more DLCs for additional content which are expensive aswell, which means its actually PLANNED like that which wasnt the case many years ago in the gaming scene). I really miss the times where you bought a game with great content and MAYBE an extension which brought a lot more content to the game and wasn't just a ""have 10 new missions and a new skin for 30 bucks"" DLC crap but all that is besides the point.  

Now there is a lot I expect from a game that costs 50 bucks and is developed by big companies like these. The story is actually pretty amazing right from the start but maybe that is because I recognize a lot of the characters from the LOTR series and the voice overs are almost perfectly done! I also like the fact that you are in the world of the orcs and have minimal contact with humans which makes the atmosphere dangerous and gives it a nice ""mordor"" vibe to it.

The main quest is ridiculously short and I was disappointed by the fact that they, instead of contributing a long storyline, added 100s of repetitive sidequests as it was already done in almost every boring RPG before and it has ALWAYS been annoying and maybe fun for the first 20 side missions.  Now I judge this game according to gameplay, I've never been a graphicwh*re, so this is (IMO) pretty embarrassing for major companies like these. It's like copying from your neighbour in school and just change some words to make it appear like it's your own work. I won't say that this is a ""copy"" of open world RPGs as they were done before because taking an idea and making something new out of it has never been bad.
In this case tho, it was just poorly made and ideas were obviously taking and only changed minorly, there was no  ""personal flavor"" to it. 

The nemesis system is great of course, tho I've rarely used the ""pass time"" function at the towers because right before the end of the game and doing all the warlord missions there wasn't really any need for them anymore and the only time I've used ""pass time"" it was forced because I glitched through many walls while ziplining or fell from bridges out the skybox when I commanded my drained uruks to attack. Also I've realised that the nemesis system, the one thing that was innovative and new had involvement from a lot of more minor companies  (you can see that in the credits). 

The boss fights are ridiculos! I mean you defeat SAURON the goddamn lord of darkness with like three QTEs, WTF?? It's supposed to be an epic fight and I had a greater fight with the first uruk captain I encountered, all of it seems to be made so sloppy, I was just waiting for an epic boss fight to happen but of course...*sigh*...the end of the game gave signs for an upcoming DLC coming out (as if I didn't knew that before). 

What I really liked were the appendices, especially as a JRR Tolkien fan, Im usually not the type that reads notes in a game and I'm also the type that skips through cutscenes which NEVER was the case here. It was indeed a great game but I expected a lot more and I was disappointed by the fact that this is just another money making machine with a lot of repetetive quests to add ""cloaked"" gameplay hours and make it seem like its a game with great content, the game had this aura to me all the time and the end was just as I expected it to be, I stopped doing the slave freeing missions at the end because they kept appearing and appearing. 

I would not say that I wouldnt recommend this game but IMO it's worth maybe 20 bucks. Buy the game when holy Gaben praises us with summer fall or winter sales, I would definitely NOT recommend buying this game now, if you want to see the gameplay watch some videos on youtube, you won't be amazed when playing this, it's very repetitive and gets very boring at the end.

The combat is basically just like the Batman games, which is good but it also has the same faults.  The target system can randomly choose a combatant in a crowd sometimes and my character goes flying across the screen to strike someone that's behind instead of the one right in front of me.  Fighting captains has become very frustrating.  If I have to stand and fight a captain or warchief, one or two other captains show up with their gangs and I end up facing 30 to 1 odds.  It's a bit ridiculous considering that I'm supposed to gather intel on the captains and come up with a plan of attack to defeat them, but all that goes out the window when I have to face 3 at the same time.  I might not have intel on all of them.  The only hope for quick kills on captains are on ones that can be killed instantly by stealth/ranged attacks or at least damaged by ranged attacks.  Otherwise I have to methodically cut through all of their gangs and wipe out the range attackers so I can concentrate on killing the captain's or warchief, but there's a time limit cause orcs will start coming out of the wood works if the main target isn’t killed quickly.  It becomes very tedious after doing it a few times. It takes away from the story part of the game to me (which is one of the most important parts for a RPG) when I have to spend so much time and effort fighting overwhelming odds just to be killed by the 30th guy to show up because he has a crossbow and shoots me in the back while I’m trying to kill 2 or 3 captains.

Oh, if I crouch down in the middle of a wide open field 20 feet in front of orc, he can't see me? Uhhh what?

And at some point, one single human chopping through hundreds of orcs gets kind of silly. With 25 of these rangers, Sauron would have been vanquished in about 30 minutes and left time for another breakfast for Bilbo."

story seems fine (being a huge lotr fan that drew me in), 
it's pretty on ultra and all, but you can't actually see much of the world, seeing as you're zoomed in so close to the character you can see the zits on his back and not much else.

The gameplay  is full on console play
we're talking cutscenes mid-combat, countless interruptions mid play and all that jazz that the console guys like, ""helpful"" tooltips screaming PRESS E! and that stuff.

the combat is not actually combat as such, you're not really doing much yourself, you don't aim it's just buttonmashing. 
for instance, you can only ""block"" if you have a tooltip on screen (that shows you the block key) if not, you'll draw your bow and so on.

the only time i've ever felt less in control of something than the character was when i tried to teach my niece to ski last winter.

so if you want to explore the edges of mordor and kill orcs, -do something else

3282,3,0.5888,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","**POTENTIAL SPOILERS**

Why I won't be recommending Assassins Creed: Batmans visits Boredor.

Pro: It's got a great combat system!
Reality: This game suffers from some serious Darksiders syndrome as for as the combat goes, at the start of the game you pretty much have nothing, which is funny because you'd think between a Ranger of Gondor and a Wraith that created the rings of power that they might have some clue on how to finish off and Uruk in melee combat without having to grab him off the floor and stab him a whole bunch of times,  admittedly this gets better after slugging it out for around 5 hours and spending your hard earned skill points on some decent finishers and such, but by this time you've realised that you can pretty much just stealth speed run everything and pick off anyone unfortunate enough to see you with your bow. (The other Uruks will just pretend that half their camp dying and nobody knowing anything about it isn't really a big deal)

In the few scenarios where you are forced into melee combat and lets say for instance you're using a 360 controller like I am, your input will look a little something like this ""xxxxxxxyxxxxxxxxyxxxxxxxaxxxxxxy"" combat is hilariously easy and very lazy.

Pro: The Nemesis System.
Reality: So at first glance the Nemesis System does look pretty cool and I can't fault anyone for being a little too excited by this concept alone and shamefully pre-ordering the game like myself, I mean whats not to love? Randomised baddies, the rise and fall of Captains and Warchiefs, Captains you don't behead can come back all scarred up and you can even get revenge on the Uruk scum that down your friends too! Well the truth is that all this adds to the game is artificial difficulty, and a lot of pointless escapades because the game saw it fit to put a Captain thats immune to everything except bow shots and has hate of failure meaning he instantly gets all of his health back when he realises he's losing the battle in the way of something you need. They also kind of shot themselves in the foot with this tactic too, all of ""The Black Captains"" we're significantly easier to beat than some of the Captains I've faced, especially the Black Hand who might as well have been replaced with a cutscene or something because the quicktime events in this game are a joke.

Pro: You can Brand Uruks and make them fight for you!
Reality: Brand is pretty much the best thing about this game as you can have all sorts of fun with it, unfortunately the game doesn't see fit to give you this ability till you have completed about half of the storyline which is really disappointing and not to mention stupid considering you can use Brand on Caragors practically at the start of the game and all it takes as far as the storyline goes to remind the Wraith that he can actually Brand Uruks is some old crone telling you to ""build an army and find a Dwarf"".

Pro: The graphics are pretty good.
Reality: If you've read this far and It's not already obvious to you that you shouldn't buy a game based on it's graphics then shame on you! Graphically this game is ok, nothing to complain about and nothing to brag about really, but graphics should always be on the bottom of the list as far as decision making goes.

Personal irks.

I'm a bit of a completionist when it comes to RPGs, I like to go out, collect things, get secrets and build the perfect character, this game is very hand holdy when it comes to collectables, you run around the game activating Forge Towers which in turn tells you on the map where all the collectables are, I made sure to do pretty much everything (short of collecting a few herbs and killing a horned graug) in the hopes of getting something nice in return for doing all that leg work, my weapons look different, occasionally the slaves do my work for me by fighting the Uruk and I got a little extra  but other than that it wasn't actually worth it.

Killing the only comic relief (Ratbag) was pretty self destructive and did nothing to advance the storyline at all.

Gollum shows up desperate to find out any information he can about the one ring by bringing you artifacts, he then disappears for ages and then returns at the end of the game with one last artifact and then tries to kill you in your day dream for no reason before you can tell him anything? What?

tl;dr: Do yourself a favour and wait for the sales, If you can't wait that long then go over to CDKeys or Gamekeys now rather than paying full Steam price and the game is okay if you're willing to slug it out for a few hours before it actually goes anywhere."

I lost over 30 hours of play time.  I've reviewed the support site, read the forums; no fixes available.  So for now, I would pass on this game until the developers own this problem and offer a solution to all of us.)

Finally!  I can be that epic, fantasy-era swordmaster that I've always wanted to be.  So many games have come close to producing this, but never quite managed to capture the experience for me.  SoM actuallys pulls this off.  I'll be playing this for months, if not years, to come.  Yes, this is basically Assassin's Creed in the Middle Earth universe.  But as a long-time Tolkien fan, I'm playing in a universe I already care about and know something about.  That adds tremendous enjoyment to the game.

The game introduces the moves slowly over the progression of the game and you find yourself slowly being able to manage larger engagements.  But the fights are enjoyable from the very start of the game.  And I must say, it's an incredible feeling to be in a prolonged sword fight with multiple opponents when your acquired skills allow you to control the entire engagement. 

So the game is overwhelmingly positive and I cannot recommend it enough.  As for cons: well, I'd like more skins for the main character.  I hear that will come with time.  Also, as with many 3D-ish games, you can occasionally fall victim to getting pummeled by enemies due to weird camera angles that don't let you see your surroundings any longer (i.e., fighting up against a wall, or pushed into a corner; hey, maybe that's realism?).  None of these cons really detract from the enjoyment of the game.

This is a great game and one I look forward to watching grow over the coming years."

You can't beat a boss down and special attacks are the only way kill them, one hit interupts special attacks.  You have to stealth kill or kill very quickly or RUN away.

     Shadows of Mordor (SoM): A game that was able to deliver decent combat mechanics but ultimately failed in every other aspect of gameplay. The enjoyment one recieves from carving up hordes of Uruks is quickly dashed once you realize that is all this game has to offer. From the Story, the Lost Treasures, and to the monotonous Outcast missions there is nothing that will engage you in the World beyond the hapless circumstances the Main Character (Talion) finds himself in.

     The Story centers around Talion, a Wraith, and their quest for revenge against Sauron. You are tasked with disrupting Saurons' Horde as it prepares for war against the World of Men. Beyond that the Story is not much clearer. You will be introduced to other characters during your travels; however, they will depart from the narrative long before any connection can be made to them. Motives for these characters are unclear beyond wanting to survive and there is no attempt to establish any character development. The story lacks pacing in the worst way as many essential character skills are locked unless the player completes most of the story missions available in the game (of which there are only 20 total, and they are short). The story feels rushed, incomplete, breaks lore, and serves as nothing but an empty vessel to give the player a shallow reason to kill Orcs.

     Most of a players' time will most likely be spent running around the game world creating their own ""adventure"". SoM provides the player with two maps (one of which is locked until a certain point in the story) both of which are relatively small. There are also treasures to find which provide lore tidbits for those interested in Middle-Earth. Unfortunately, there is no real discovery to be had as once the player unlocks the 'Forge Towers' placed on the map the locations of all Treasures are displayed. The only tasks that are available to the player (beyond killing Orcs) is to find those treasures or rescue slaves. Those slaves can provide additional missions for the player to complete. Each slave rescue mission plays out the similar to the one before which will leave the player bored of the monotony.

     Of course the most touted feature of this game is the Nemesis System. This was supposed to create dynamic personalities for the Orcs the player spent their time fighting. This system is a hit and miss. The Orc Captains/Warchiefs do generate their own personalities, which breaths some life in an otherwise stale game; however, for the system to truely shine the player needs to be defeated by Orcs. That is the only way the Nemesis System can show off the ""dynamic"" personalities of the Orcs, as the Captains and Warchiefs who are able to defeat Talion or escape his deathblow will remember him. Not much comes from such outcomes other than a few lines of dialogue so do not expect anything revolutionary.

     Shadows of Mordor is a game that provides very little to the player beyond beating up Orcs. The Nemesis System is hardly extraordinary, the side missions in the game are incredibly tedious and monotonous, and the Story is incredibly weak as well as short. If one has played any of the Assassin's Creed games then SoM will feel familiar to them in almost every way. From the poorly developed characters, to the atrocious side activities available to the player, this game will leave you desiring much more after the shine of fighting Orcs wears off. Lord of the Rings fans might find a bit of fun with this game; however, there isn't much here that will cause anyone to remember this game after the initial rush."

3307,4,0.5137,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Short Version:
The good: The game has good graphics and some good voice acting.
The bad: Instant fail stealth missions coupled with a thread-bare stealth system.  Performance issues at certain points (which I assume will be resolved at some point).  Poor tutorial.  The camera can do stupid things at the most inoppertune times.
The Ugly:  All you do in this game is fight orcs.  The only difference from fight to fight is the venu and perhaps some speical immunities, such as the orc might be immune to ranged attacks.  Unlike a game such as Dark Souls, where each enemy is a bit different and the combat is very engaging, in this game its very repetitive and gamey.    It gets very old and this is all you do in this game.


A slighly longer version which may contain some minor spoilers:
There are two sections to this game, Ill call them the ""everyhing is muddy and brown"" and then the ""There is actual plant life here"" areas.  In the second area you do what you did in the first area only this time it isn't an excercise in futility.  You posses orcs in this half and then try and do make them war chiefs (which you should know by watching any preview videos).

Anway, you get a bunch of upgrades, which for the most part are very boring.  There are also ruins you can slot your weapons with, but they are thing like: 15% chance to get +10 health (which is nothing) when you chop someones head off (a very rare occurance).  In other words, I was completly bored to death with all thier ruins.  Basically in some special situation there is a not very good chance to get a buff that in itself, isn't very good.  

So I mostly ignored that part.  I found a few epic runes where where ""meh"" but far better than the other runes you got.

Anway then there is this nemisis system which creats random orcs with random powers.  Its ok, but as the orcs get higher ranks / powers then lose weaknesses and gain strengths.

Let me tell you why I quit this game without finishing it:

I got all the orcs under the tier of warchief under my control.  In fact I had the two 2 ranks of orcs under my control.

Then there is this one war chief I want to go after.  3 of my orcs which all had a HIGHER power raiting than the war chief were his body guards.   Now you would think this would be a walk in the park, right?  Oh this war cheif was also immune to stealth, immune to ranged, regenerated, had a horde of followers and then another property which made the horde an uber horde of elite guys or something).  Also, everythig enranged this guy (makes them even more uber I guess).  Fire, wild animals, the ranger, day time, night time, etc...    He had a bunch of other strengths as well.  I was a LONG list.

But I had my 3 uber dudes right?

So anyway I go to fight this guy and he is deep within his fortess.  Sure enough has an army of shield guys.  Also there is a low rank elite captain with him.  This guy has an army of bezerks too. Like 8 of them and he is following this war chief.

Now my guys?  They are there, but they have NOTHING.  No troops.  Just themselves.  WTF?  I try being sneaky and stuff by possesing other guys, but at some point I screw up and get caught and combat starts.  You know what happens next?  All my possed orcs, the guys right below the war chief who are MORE powerful according to the game, than the war chief himself get into melee and DIE.  Where are thier armies?  Then I died (the camera was going crazy, and I could never see where I was going).  Then as timed advaned all but 2 of my possed orcs DIED.

In other words start over.   

I do not think so.  The combat was already very boring and I just wanted to finish the game.  So I am done.  I will not punish myself any further.  After playing Dark Souls 2, I was in the mood for another combat game, but this game isn't anything like that.  I guess if you found Batman combat thrilling, then you would like this game.  Otherwise, stay away.

The awful story coupled with the downright pathetic ending (Deadline looming? Ran out of money?

- Very repetitive after 1-2 hours:

  kill\control X warchiefs
  towers (welcome AC) 

- Controls are total crap. You want to sprint... and now u are making jump stun an enemy and taking hits from all sides. You have got Hit Counter glowing, wanna finish enemy - there is no crosshair or target selection, you need to use your camera to select target but sometimes enemies overlap or your ""controlled"" orc is in front of target, now he is dead. 
Sometimes bow is not shooting, u hear ""ready"" sound, release mouse and nothing happens.

- Most of the runes are useless. You need to fight same enemies to get them. Kill 1st with bow, kill 2nd with dagger, 3rd with sword, repeat.

- Enemy respawn system is stupid, clear location go away for 100ft (ft, why not meters?) come back and it's filled with enemies again.

Visuals and sounds are superb, voice acting also.
Gameplay is repetative and combat copy from batman series, though this makes it really easy.
Also imersion is poor as your screen is full of icons etc. Minimap reveals even plants in cround. There is not mutch to discover in this game. Actually moving and stealth is copy from AC series, sadly enemy AI is also.

With out superb Orc's and their relations this would be good looking medicore game, now it's ok game that you play just to relax.

Game should have gone more to immersive side and not handheld so mutch. Also its quite boring that your gear is same all the time.

Not really worth the hype. Ok fun game but nothing superb here (exept those Orc realtions etc.)

Ps. Warhammer Orc's would need game like this. Though you should be green skinned.

The game has about 20 main missions and no side quests. Only ""skill"" games, which bring you money you get anyways.
Also they threw in Gollum and a noname dwarf and also an ""epic"" monster battle that takes 5 minutes and has nothing to do with the story. So the real ""story"" is about 15 missions. 

It all builds up to the end:
Get your own army and fight against the rest + beat the 3 endbosses. and just let me say, it's ridiculous: 
Your army consists of 15 People max and you fight against a 5 bosses+endless wave army.

You just let your own guys fight against 5 bosses and watch - 3/10 fun, 5 minutes,

Then, Finish 2nd last boss off with a no-fight movement out of the tutorial - no fun, 2 minutes, 

Final Boss: drag your mouse two times into a circle and press spacebar.

2. Quick action sequence.  The fights are reduced to this......  

3.  Limited attacks with each type of weapon.   Rinse, repeat, boring.

4.  You're banished from death,  but YOU CAN DIE!!  Really???

If you enjoy being led thru the game by your hand and can just mash mouse buttons to plow your way thru, this is your game.  If you would like a challenge, spend your money elsewhere. 

Buyer's Remorse."
3330,4,0.4747,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","I wanted to like Shadow of Mordor, but as another review has stated, ""This game was more frustrating than fun.""

First the good:

The graphics were great, the audio was great, and the voice acting was great was great. The immersion was there. Even the gameplay was fun: I thought a twitch-style game wasn't for me, but the melee combat was actually enjoyable. The Uruk captains really seemed to have a bit of personality, and I really enjoyed the idea that you needed to learn strengths/weaknesses to feel like you had a good chance of defeating one.

Now the bad bits:

First, the ""open world"". I don't feel like this really added anything to the game; you could just as well have lined up missions for me to choose from, with those missions taking place in the various parts of the world, and I would have had enjoyed the immersion just as much. In Mordor, there is baren waste land, ruins, and that's it. All the areas look the same, except some have a higher amount of enemies.

Next, there are the challenge missions. If you give me a mission saying I need to shoot 20 archers right now, I would expect that you would be nice enough to disable the roaming captains. But instead, you often find these challenges that should be forcusing on stealth or bowmenship or killing hodres of peons suddenly a fight with a leader. Or three. Oh, and those archers that were supposed to be a challenge to kill without a few leaders around? They're still there peppering you with arrows.

The pacing of gaining abilities was also strange. In order to unlock the more powerful abilities, you need to gain more power. This means that if early on, you just want to gain intel, do collection quests, and avoid leaders (""bide your time""), you end up with a bunch of ability points and no abilities to spend them on. I guess I'll just update my HP some more...

Finally, let's talk about that forced-stealth insta-fail mission. Don't get me wrong; I love cloak and dagger, and would wager that much of my time before that mission was aligning those stealth kills out in the wild. But I did not buy this game because it was a stealth game; it's an action game with some stealth mechanics. If I wasn't so frustrated by some of the other issues, I might have given it another hour to finish that level. This game is now uninstalled. I'll be going back to playing my cloak and dagger elf in Skyrim.

It's hard to give a downvote to such a well made game.  I wish there was a ""neutral"" option.

I was very excited for the release of the game because of all I had seen from PAX and Twitch.  The Nemesis system is intriguing and in theory gives the NPCs more life and meaning.  The graphics are beautiful and the combat is fluid.  Unfortunately I know the combat very well because I've played the Arkham games.  This is Batman in Mordor, and that's pretty dreary.  Every orc group battle feels the same and most of them can be easily waded through by mashing two buttons.  The combos, grab and throw, and wraith stun could add variety to fights if they weren't actually less effective than simple X mashing.

Pros:
+ Well polished bug free experience
+ Beautiful graphics
+ Fluid melee action

Cons: 
- Unoriginal and repetitive
- Nemesis orcs lose luster after a few hours, then it becomes tedious
- Bow mechanics are clunky

I got bored.  Your opinion may vary.

Stay away for now. Crash happy.  Read the discussion forums.  I will update this when the game becomes stable.

*2nd Review*
Wow.  I can't believe the extremely high ratings for this game.  It is massively one dimensional.  Did the little geektards get all worked up over a new 'system' as in 'Nemesis'?  Seriously curious because I am just finding it the same thing over and over.

Major PC upgrade for myself.  The game is very beautiful.  Still one dimensional and shallow.  Nothing there for me."
3338,3,0.5187,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","For a game that's based off Tolkien, it surely isn't blessed by him. Because Tolkien would of never let the lack of a dynamic world and lack of interesting characters happen if he was involved. We'll see how this game impacts others in the future because there sure was a lot of positives in my opinion! Just not in the storytelling and world-building, relationship building part. My favorite part about this game was the convenience, traveling, and running. 

Moving around was never frustrating and getting from one place to another was very streamlined in my opinion. And yes, this game was ridiculously easy. Or to put it another way, there was no challenge. No challenge means the video gamer goes into spectator mode and loses engagement/interest. 

The rewards lessen the easier the game gets. I didn't care for the attributes and skills because I never felt like I needed them. And the bosses, don't even get me to the bosses. What bosses? And the protagonist never changes. Ideally, you want your main character to be emotionally and sometimes physically effected by every scene he encounters. Even more by every Boss he encounters, he should grow and change in some way, either negatively or positively. Over the course of the game, he must of gone somewhere, mentally, physically, whatever. This does not happen here. 

The biggest problem in this game is the fact that you know what matters most to Talion right from the beginning. His wife. His family. His best friend. They get slaughtered within the first 10 minutes. The rest of the game you're wondering how things will return to that emotional moment. It never really connects to his love for the family, and instead we're bombarded with flashback and flashback. Active events don't occur in present time. The main enemy never makes moves which causes Talion to react. The overall storyworld never changes, never shifts. There is no overall political story line. Political storylines is what drove Tolkien's LOTR world and the constant shifts and transformations is what made Lord of the Rings such an engaging and active place to take part in. 

I give it a B if you include the oh my god finishing kill moments and convenience of gameplay and wonderful travelling. Rate C if you include the groundbreaking Nemesis system. Rate D if you take in account the lack of challenge. Rate F if I take in account storytelling and character development/interest.

D"

I Was super hyped for this game, when i first started playing it was fun but when i completed the main storyline it instantly got boring as the game lacks so much content and its now just a go around and kill orcs which is no fun.

Good things:

It's a lord of the rings themed game
Fun until you complete the storyline
Good combat like Assassins Creed added with some wraith magic
Graphics are good even on low settings (For me but might be different for others)
You can ride a Graug!

Bad things:

Storyline was a bit short for my liking
Bosses were too easy to kill
Only 2 zones
The zones are small
There's no difficulty on it to either make it easier or harder so the game isn't really a challenge unless you're bad at it

Things that need updating/ added into the game:

More and bigger zones
More and different enemies
Being able to send your Captains and Warchiefs on missions of your choosing
When it says you can make an army it should be hundreds of uruks not just 10
More Captain and Warchief slots
Adding a survival kind of mode or at least make it co-op or max of 8 people
More runes
More and different talents
Needs trolls! 
More content and more things to do (I know there's going to be DLC etc)

My rating:

After being hyped for a long while waiting to play the game it seemed a big disappointment because of the lack of things in the game and it has so much potential so hopefully things will be added into the game

It's Assassins Creed, with a bit of Batman Arkham in it, they try constantly to force you to do stealth for ""story purposes"" but you are a walking orc killing machine, if you just pay attention, you are immortal, the stealth mechanics works just fine, better then in Assassins Creed I think, but I never felt that I needed to use it, when I might aswell chop trough hundreds of orcs, though game forced stealthplay.

I finished it in about 20h, did everything except for finding that damn last hunt, I didn't encounter much bugs, I got stuck in about 3 walls and one time I suddenly entered the atmosphere but other than that, nothing.

One thing that really buggered me was that you do loads of stuff on the same buttons, you for example use one of the major attacks on the same button as ""drop down from ledges"" and that killed me a few times and made me fail a few missions, it's really frustrating when they do this but atleast it works to a longer extent.

PROS;
-Decent length
-Combat feels good and ""meaty""
-Lots of attacks and different mechanics
-Nemesis system is fun for an hour or two

CONS;
-They constantly force you to do stealth instead of improvising
-COLLECTATON, there so much stuff to collect, some people really enjoy this, I don't
-The specc for your character didn't feel as something that would be unique to you, basically everyone who plays will take the same essential stuff and maybe leave some things out like ""throwing daggers"" (which I NEVER used)

Honestly, I couldn't really decide on wether I do or do not reccomend this game. I eventually chose to pick no, because of the overhype. I imagined this game to be so much more, even while I was playing it. I'll point out a couple of things, starting with the mechanics and the ideas of the gameplay itself.

- The strategy part
What I imagined from this game was that you had to plan out ahead before you would take on the mini-bosses (or in this case, the captains and the warchiefs), and be creative in the free world that would offer me unlimited opportunities. Having to find out what weaknesses my target would have, what runes I should equip to my weapon, what bodyguards I should assign to which war chief and so forth. When I finally got to the part where it seemed that I had to plan out at least something, the game ended. I had reached the final level of the game, and it just ended right there. No massive boss fight, no climactic massive end battle with all of my captured Uruks, just a small nearly unlosable fight with a bunch of war chiefs vs war chiefs. I was imagining these huge battles with my personalized army that I could control over the battlefield, but it was nothing like that. There hardly seems to be very much strategy in this game, other than having to 'stealth' your way through the occasional mission or to reach the occasional harder mini-boss. 
  
In a summary (TL;DR strategy): 
 - Can not actively control units other than to tell what captain your captain should kill or what captain your war chief should follow. Also you can just beat/shoot/lure your target to death. Just make sure he doesnt have a million Uruks around him.
 
 - The stealth part
For some reason, stealth is both very forgiving but also very unforgiving. From what I've seen, there's 2 types of stealth in this game.
 
1: Don't get detected (This is the very forgiving stealth kind). As soon as you get detected ( a red triangle over an enemies head), you still have a small amount of time to viciously murder your enemy. This is quite easy, since you can still use your bow (which gives you slow motion for a small amount of time, so unless you screw up and alert 30 guys you should be fine). Next to that, your enemies are fucking blind. 'Oh, a human with a cape and 2 swords on his back is slowly crawling his way towards me, but not directly? MUST NOT BE A DEATH THREAT DURR'. Maybe all of the grog has weakened their eyesight or something, I don't know. But this form of stealth is easy. I think I've been caught twice or three times in the entirety of the game when it came to this kind of stealth.
 
2: Don't raise the alarms (This is absolute frustration hell). I'm not sure what the deal is with this game, but it just hates this kind of missions. It hates you, it hates stealth, it hates dead Uruks and it hates Branded (converted) enemies. Let me explain it in this way.
It hates you: As soon as an enemy runs towards the beacon to sound the alarms, there's a small icon above his head that shows he's going to do the douche bag move, rather than to fight himself. 'So what's the problem? You should be able to see him, right?'. Yeah, but only when you're looking in his direction. If he's doing it behind your back, you're screwed. Which means you will have to watch your back constantly, every freaking second, to check if nobody's about to raise the alarms.
It hates stealth: The free running mechanic in this game is cool, but also kind of iffy. Especially iffy when you dont want it to be iffy. Like in 'dont raise the alarms' stealth. As soon as you see that fucker run off to the beacon to light it, and you are hanging on a ledge or standing on a diagonal wall, you are completely boned. Or you have to be lucky. Why? Because (though this might be my noobiness, but I've tried alot of things) there is no way to completely jump down if there's something to grab before you hit the ground, which results in a very slow descension. By the time you reach the ground, 90 Uruks are ready to ram their daggers up your ass and the mission you tried to do failed horribly. When you're on the roof tops or walls, you will have to watch your step too. There could be any moment that you [i]THINK[/i] that you can make that jump, but then it turns out to be too far, or not far enough. Like when you want to get down in that archer tower, but you just keep skipping from one wall to another and you just [b]DIE[/b] of [b]FRUSTRATION[/b] and you fail the mission. Or you fall down and grab one small stone just above the ground, which leaves you hanging like a dumbass and a few daggers in your back, since everyone has already spotted you. And of course you failed the mission as well, don't forget about that. The whole free running thing isn't fluent when you're trying to be sneaky, but that is when I would like it to [b]be[/b] the most fluent. It's kind of horrible.
It hates dead Uruks: Enemies [i]respawn[/i]. [i]During[/i] the mission. On the [i]same[/i] spots. What the [i]fuck[/i] man.
It hates branded (converted) enemies: Doing a 'dont raise the alarm' stealth mission? Don't brand any enemy, because they will raise the alarm for you. They're party beasts like that. Get it? [i]Beasts?[/i] No but seriously, when you think you're going smooth and alright in a mission, and you just have to open that last cage, you suddenly FAIL the mission. Because you did not see the icon of the guy raising the alarm, even if you did you would be stuck against a wall like fucking spiderman. And why was the guy raising the alarm? Because even though you cleared the ENTIRE GODDAMN AREA or CONVERTED ALL OF THE FUCKING ENEMIES, they respawn and see that [i]something is amiss[/i] and they just raise the alarm for the hell of it. Or your branded buddies just blew their cover by accidentally stabbing another Uruk in the face. I mean it happens all the time in Mordor, but since you're doing a mission it becomes [i]suspicious[/i]

In a summary (TL;DR stealth):
Stealth: Either too easy or too hard. Game will not give a damn, or screw you over entirely by bad mechanics in the game.

The combat part:
Absolutely amazing. Don't change anything. Seriously, it's what has made me enjoy this whole game a million times more.

The freedom in the world:
Also amazing. I disregarded the first mission and went out exploring. I found out I could ride doggies, that some big baddies are afraid of even bigger doggies, and I just went on a rampage for about 30 minutes. It was magical and it was heaven.

The skills:
Meh. Some are amazing, some are utterly useless. And some you just plain forget about because you hardly ever use them, but I think that also applies to game style. Which also adds to freedom in the game, you get to kind of make your own combat. 

The graphics:
Utterly stunning. It was like I was watching a movie in some of the cutscenes, and the whole scenery made me really connect with the game. Also it runs really smooth on a computer that is not fully pimped out to the max. Optimization must be amazing.

The music:
It's LOTR. [i]What else do I have to say?[/i]

The story:
You can collect small lore items and uncover more behind the person(s) you are playing and their relations, but also about the different 'countries' or areas, items, monsters, and whatmore. It's expansive and I feel that for the backstory fanboys this game should be a blast for the story alone. I'm glad to see they still put a lot of time in putting this much lore into this game. 
There is one small thing that I did not like about the storyline, and that was the confusion. Some of the storyline just cuts off completely without hearing about it ever again, and some things are just horrible explained. It might be because I cleared it in one sitting, but I still feel a little confused about it all.

Good game, just small gaming content for the 50 bucks."

3372,3,0.3954,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","In my opinion, it's not a bad game, but it's not a good game either... It's the love child of Assassin's Creed and Dark Souls. By this, I mean, imagine running around as Ezio in Dark Souls. That's what you have here.

While I'm not going to complain about the combat system, it's simple... Like Back to the NES days simple. 1 button to attack, another to counter/defend. The AI is stupid. I mean, REALLY stupid. I found myself with a tough Uruk, so I had him follow me around a big boulder. Attack him from behind, run back around and attack him from behind again. Repeat until dead. Take note, it doesn't take much to die. An archer can drop you in 2 or 3 hits easy, and there's no difficulty setting to tone it down. You either suck and die or rule and kill! Getting involved in major combat is a slow and boring process like watching golf or grass grow, which takes away the fun of a good fight.

There's really no clear path as far as how to proceed. Less so than any Elder Scrolls or Fallout game I've ever played. You can go to random markers on the map and hope you don't get destroyed. There's random things you can do like go around collecting things that give you some background story. You may or may not find it interesting.

On the technical end, the game is fantastic, if not seemingly a little poorly optimized. Playing this with dual GTX 780 Ti Classifieds, and they don't break a sweat, but on ultra settings it sometimes stutters and drops to its knees. Short of that, everything looks and sounds great.

But no, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you're one of those people that stays up all night defending Lord of The Rings from Star Wars fans for the title of best trilogy."

The fighting is way too easy I was fighting hords of orcs and as long as I hit the button the at right time winner winner chicken dinner evey time. I also got tired of hearing that one same voice actor for almost every orc. As for the open world aspect of it Not impressive. Although you can walk  just about everywhere.

3377,3,0.4654,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","[b]This is a cautionary review, illustrating why you should ignore the new Steam user-tags feature.[/b]

If you enjoy the Batman Arkham ___ games and Assassin's Creed, you will probably enjoy this game. If you go into it expecting an action RPG, you are going to hate the game. There's no coherent story, just a bunch of missions and an over-abundance of combat to distract you from this fact. That is a proven formula for a a good action-adventure game, but not so much for an RPG.

I would recommend Risen 3 instead of this game if you're looking for an action RPG to hold you over before Dragon Age.


Be warned, the tags that appear the top of the store page in bold blue letters are the opinions of other users. They are not, as you would expect, official in any way.

3379,2,0.3639,"control, button, bad, want, time, press, right, ever, shit, click","I was looking forward to this game, so much. And I could not have been anymore dissappointed in a game. This game has some of the worst controls I ever seen. The fighting system, which is just like Batman. Which I love. But on this game, there are tons of problems.  Most of the time. you'll hit a button & nothing happens.. Like you could be trying to get a hold of someone. And nothing happens & you just end up going in the completely wrong direction. This game really makes you appreciate games like Assassin's Creed & Batman. In these games you character does, what you what him to do. They tried to copy off this games with controls. But they fell, way, way too short. You could be having fun, playing this game. And when this last stand struggle icon pops up on your screen. Which happens ""ALL THE TIME"" ! IT'S GAME OVER!!! You could be playing this game completely perfect, with no mistakes. But when you see that icon pop up...you have just been wasting you time, for however long you have been playing. Well lets just say this happens a good 90 percent of the time. So if you been playing this game for a good 30 or 40 minutes. You'll just have to start all over...Awesome right lol! And when you get to where your going & start to fight something. You can count on seeing this icon for sure. As soon as you see the icon pops up, it will say point your thumb stick in this direction. And when you get within a circle, it will tell you hit a button. But as soon as it pops up & tells you what to do, your already dead. It does not give you, anywhere near the time you need to survive. They need to just throw that whole system away, right now. Or at least give us the option of turning it off. And believe me, I love some hard games like Dark Souls. And I do love a challenge. But this is just stupid. Another big problem, with the controls. When your climbing or in stealth mode, which is just like Assassin's Creed. Which is cool. But it's a really crappy version of it. And for some strange reason they just forgot some basic things. Example... say you climb all the way up a tower to kill a archer. And you want to turn around & jump to the tower that is right behind you. And it could be almost touching you back. The ledge is within a arm's reach. But there's no way to turn around & jump to an object. Like someone just forgot about that. Also the game is very, very repetitive. I just hope that they fix these things. Because because it could be a half way OK game.... if they fixed these things. And if the got rid of the last stand crap. But if they did fix all this stuff,you might just be able to play this game & have a little bit of fun slicing down orc's. Yeah it's repetitive but chopping heads off for a little while, could be fun...right?

Here goes...

I'm very on-the-fence about this game. 

I've gone through many of the areas of the game, and to be honest, it all starts to look identical. Caragors, Orcs, crumbling tower ruins - all basically the same. I get that this is Mordor, but even with great graphics, animations, and production design - it gets very boring to look at. Even as the map opens up to the next one, it merely replaces the blackened ground with lush grasses, cliffs, and steppes - the ruins feel pretty much the same.

Much ado was given about the Nemesis System - but so far, all I've really seen is a revolving door of Orcs that, much like the scenery, starts to blur together into a long chain of interchangable Orcishness. I kill a few, they get replaced by others. They kill me, they get promoted. Sometimes they run away, or survive my antics, only to pop up later for the cycle to continue. Not exactly as revolutionary as it was made to sound. Even got to kill a few more than once. Which was a little weird.

The combat is very reminiscent of the Arkham Batman games, to the point where I found myself using many of the same tactics - and fought enemy types that were also cut-and-pasted from the Arkham series. I eventually started calling Talion ""Batmanigorn"" because, aside from gliding/grappling around, I sort of felt like a sword-wielding Batman and not a Ranger of the North. I don't mind this type of combat, but after 3 (soon to be 4) Arkham games, I started to feel like playing more Arkham Asylum/City/Origins, rather than Shadows of Mordor.

Some of the Lore-changing/additions are interesting, a few are not actually possible (I'm looking at you Mr. Elf wraith!). And what could've been a great plot-twist concerning the origins of the Wraith Talion is bound to (which I won't reveal), advertising/promotion has largely spoiled. 

That being said, the game looks good, runs well, controls are fairly tight (if you use a controller), it has a good musical score, and excellent voice acting for the Orcs.

Do I like it? Yes. 

But not so much that I think I'm going to be playing it in 6 months. 

In my opinion, there could've been much more story and drama injected into this game's beginnings - but it largely feels lifeless, and a bit uninspired. I don't really have a sense of Talion's pain, nor his Wraith companion's. If I'm rooting for anyone, it's Ratbag. He actually has some kind of personality, direction, and sense of humor. Talion is mopey, bland, and needlessly gruff. The Wraith is an arrogant know-it-all (which is funny for an amnesiac). Why would I want to play these guys? Why would I want them to succeed? And in the grand scheme of things, does it even matter if they do?

All-in-all, I just don't feel like I'm playing in Middle-earth. It feels a bit more like playing in someone's not-quite-fully-fleshed out fan-fiction. 

And then there's the lack of content. 2.5 months and the only real additional content are Runes, 2 character swapping costumes, and a few Warband missions that drop piddley-ass runes. The Warband missions don't even deviate from the basic hunt-the-orc-chief-down quests and add nothing really to the game. Charging people for this is shameful. 

As of right now: 6/10

Good, but not great. All these professional reviewers squealing in girlish glee over this game are on hallucinogenic drugs. This game isn't anywhere near the stream of 9+/10s I've been seeing.

The graphics, music, art direction, and Orc voice acting elevate what is otherwise a game that borrows extremely heavily from other sources."
3390,3,0.4926,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Kind of Meh. It's not a bad game just overhyped.

Gameplay: A lot of the cool hyped mechanics don't unlock till after plot points.
Movement/Stealth: Nearly on part with Assassin's Creed.
Meele: Really repeative but relatively smooth until berserkers show up...
Ranged: Very smooth.

Difficulty:
It's a lot like the dynasty warriors franchise. The difficulty is mostly from the waves of nameless fodder you have to kill while also killing the named one. It can be brutal before the mentioned plot point and is quite easy after.

Nemesis:
So much potential that sadly doesn't seem like it’s going any place in my play through. I was blessed with two. Zog Jitters a woulderful little scamp that kept showing up to jump me at big fights. Then there is the coward that ran from every defeat. Both have sadly been absent from cut scenes that it would make sense to have them in.

It's certainly not a 10/10 game like many have touted it to be, I'd give it more a like a 5.5 to 6/10 which isn't necessarily bad just average and I am still strangely glad it's done well for Monolith but it's just really repetitive and boring once you go past the first 8 hours or so which are great.

Compared to the two common mentioned games this is clearly influenced by it's missing the two main things those game's have going for them. The Arkham series has am interesting story / characters and variety in each of it's missions and environments while Assassins Creed (namely Black Flag) has a breadth of fun repetitive tasks in varied and beautiful settings in an actual open world / sea and has genuine wow moments.

I think if you don't mind the repetition / grindy feel after the honeymoon period then this is a great purchase because most things work good to great at the least but if your the type of person who likes do more then constantly button mash 5-10 enemies every time, variety in: enemies (although the Orcs do have much variety in their looks), missions / tasks, loot and locales this may disappoint you as it has for me.

First 6 hours play:
Can't really add anything new to the praise that has already been bestowed upon this game. 6hrs in at time of writing and I'd agree it's a mix of Assassins Creed (Stealth and free-running), Far Cry (Towers and setting creatures on enemies) and Batman Arkham series (Freeflow combat right down to the Y button being your counter).

It's unique selling point is the Nemesis system which well make you heavily think twice about just 'dying' almost in a Dark Souls (not that you lose anything specifically) kind of way because ultimately your death means benefits for your enemies (literally any Orc that kills you) and new strategies required to take them down or out.

I'm not sure it's a 10/10 status yet because the map I'm on at the moment seems quite small in comparison to the games it's inspired by and they could be potential later on for uncanny value or over-repetition (maybe, too early to say) but it's definitely a strong 8-9/10 game for these first 6 hours, a good buy!

Now we just need Alien Isolation & The Evil Within to be great and get similar glowing reviews and we'll have probably the strongest month's gaming / releases this year!

(NOTE UPDATED: I have a GeForce GTX 750Ti with 2GB RAM and the high texture setting works good at 1080p so the 3GB they said was required for high texture quality is BS for the most part although you may have to restart (or stay on medium, noticeable but not hugely) the game if it starts to get start and stop after a while playing per session. I imagine the same will be true for The Evil Within which reckons 4Gb minimum, couldn't run Ultra though (many say differences are minute) and bear in mind the Ultra texture's is another 35Gb download for you to enjoy if you aren't on Fibre!)"
3398,3,0.603,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well",Alright so I went and bought this game and played it a ton. This game isn't what you might be thinking it is. I personally expected a lot out of this game and didn't like it at all. First the fights are fun at the start but over time the repition of the fights get old. Using the same moves and same things they say it gets old really fast. For graphics wise its amazing and has very good features there. Another thing that is with this game is that the diffculty vaires a lot. First off you start as really good then you progress and you get to a point were its almost impossible to win without dieing over and over. After you get past that part it gets super easy and when you get to the very ending there is no difficulty at all. It gets very boring no real excitement in the second part of the game at all. The final boss fight is extremely depressing. It is basically just a button sequence boss fight. It prepares you to face this ending and your like oh no this fight is going to be tough and then its just button squence. Such a lame ending to a game honestly. Overall I give it a 5 out of 10.
3399,4,0.3495,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","The game is well made and I guess it could be entertaining. I felt that the combat was too easy. The game basically plays itself for you. You're just kind of along for the ride. Its chalk full of quick time events which I detest.

Buy if you want a good story and some fun action. 

Avoid if you're looking for an actual open world RPG with depth in the gameplay or a challenge.

For everyone telling me to put more time into the game - I'm not going to bother if the game can't draw me in the first few hours of playing. The game is incredibly simple to cheese: 

- Stealth sprint around and 1 shot everything except for the captains.
- Right Click when prompted to auto block and counter.
- Press F to instantly kill your target with a finisher
- *yawn*

If you die you mouse into a target area and push the displayed button to counter the enemies finisher. That's a quick time event in my book.

The game is nothing more than a watered down console port that caters to a generation of gamers who do not know what gameplay and challenge are.

Update: Destiny agrees with me, watch as he slaughters enemies with his monitor turned off by mashing left and right click: http://youtu.be/6AV9W2ZdmjU

This looks and feels like an AC ripoff. The parcour system, the battle system, it's all the same. The hierarchy system for the Uruk Hai is a nice gimmick but bores so easily. I have reached the point where, as soon as I get in combat at any given point, at least 2 officers will pop up in the same minute and just jump into the battle. As soon as there are more than 10 enemies, it becomes so easy to lose oversight (again same as AC) and having to dodge the shielded ones while my character is still going through the previous 3 attacks that are already queued always results into getting my ass handed to me. The open map bores extremely easy, seeing you only visit each area once thoroughly for the hidden things (fun fact : use the map to set a waypoint to these 'hidden' things and they will lead you right to it, you don't even need to do any effort into locating them).

It is a fun game if you like AC but don't expect a real immersive game. I have been looking forward to this game since it was announced and I feel extremely let down... There was so much potential here but WB just decided to copy AC and leech of their success..

3402,3,0.6161,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Despite it being fun as hell, and very exciting to rise the ranks of your orcs I do not recommend this game. IF you do get it buy the bundle with expansion pass. This is a HIGH DLC baited game ending. You will feel the breath taking beginning, and middle story type feeling, but that is where it leaves you. No good ending that leaves your mouth tastless. I really want to recommend it because the gameplay itself was full as hell. You feel there is so MUCH TO DISCOVER, but it is all closed off for DLC.

NOTE: The reason the game is fun is the nemesis system, but after you collect, and complete all side missions the game becomes BORING. Reason why I keep going back to the game is because I felt the story was WAY to short and unsatisfying. They rushed that last 2 boss battles. One boss battle all you do is the drain the guy 5 times, cutscene of him dying by your hand while you don't get to do anything. Then the last boss battle is you using the ""last chance"" mechanic 3 times. Game is over. The whole story is based on you killing 5 warchiefs in 1 area, branding 5 in the other, boom story over with a little bit of characters introduced and disappeared here and there. I would go into more detail, but this is a review, not a spoilers. When everything is 100% and nothing more to do all you find yourself doing is playing around with the Nemesis system killing orcs, branding warchiefs, rekilling them all so you can do it again and again and again."

3404,4,0.4647,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","Unfortunately I cannot reccomend this game.

The game ive very well made but it is extremely repetative. The repetition starts from the very get go, its just chase down each captain and kill them. If you die to many times the captains starts to roam in packs, thus making it harder (which is a good and bad thing). I've managed to kill 3 out of 4 Warchiefs so far. The last being the most difficult, because every single Captain showed up with him.

The gameplay itself has alot of good points, the combat system is kinda fluid, the travel system is good etc, if you want to compare this game to something else, it has to be Assassins Creed. Although the combat system is fluid, its is very.. bleugh, you have to depend on getting a hit streak built up before you can technically kill anything (without hacking and slashing it to death, or spending 5 seconds executing it on the floor).

The hit streak is the real problem for me in the game, I feel like its holding the potential back from killing creatures, the diversity of Uruk comprise of Thrown Spears, Crossbows, Bows, Swordsman, Spear and Shield and Berserker. Each one has to be fought in a different way, so when fighting in a stronghold there are typically all typing in a big group around you, thus making it impossible to keep the streak going without breaking, attacking a berserker with noraml attacks get parried, attacking a shield does not add stacks to the streak, the ranged indicators which come up on the screen to dodge the missiles are very vague. I just feel that this is holding it back, and if you want buy a game that requites you to go stealthed or loud, jumping around building with lots of aggrovators around you, then I reccommend Assassins Creed.

One final point on the repetition and the nemesis system, overall I feel the nemesis system is very good feature for the first hour of gameplay, but after that it becomes very repetative and pretty much redundant, much like the gameplay as a whole. In my game currently, there is an Uruk Captain which is and Elite Captain, it turns up at every Captain battle then either runs away or one shots me, when it runs away it gains ranks, much like when it kills me, and now I am only 6 hours into the game and this specific Captain may aswell be a 5th warchief, it is level 20 and immune to every spell/attack I have and is becoming a hidnerance to the rest of the game.

TLDR: Nemesis system good in the beginning, combat extremely repetative and slow, free-roam aspect good, missions are too similar and boring, Captains can get stronger than you very quickly, overwhelming amount of Uruk in specific places making it hard to really play.

3415,3,0.5703,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Its a good game and very well polished. However, I don't know if I can recommend it. Its kind of boring and a bit monotone. The Nemesis system seriously doesn't do anything, at least in my game's playthrough because the game was so mindnumbingly easy. I rarely EVER failed to kill an NPC that I wanted to kill so I never really see it being a big issue. (Note: I literally killed the warchief and all of his bodyguards without the whole backstabbing/dominating/etc. In fact, I killed ALL the warchiefs without even having to dominate a single person.)

The good:
The game is very well polished and it shows. The combat is excellent. Its very much like the Batman series. Counters, combos, etc. Its very smooth and fluid and is a pleasure to play. You feel epic and powerful when you do the things correctly. The characters are well sketched out, predominately the orcs that you play against and the voice acting is literally some of the best work I've heard in a long, long time.

The cape is nice?

The meh:
The Nemesis System isn't that impressive. I get what they were trying to do and it is a good foundation, but it is not nearly where it should be or what people think it is.
               - Let me get to the point. The nemesis system is the selling point for this game and it doesn't sell very well. It is hardly memorable. The problem lies I guess with the game's core/fundamental failure which I will get to in a  moment.
The graphics are good, but they're not spectular. Honestly, its sort of like Batman or Sleeping Dogs with HD Texture packs.
Nothing groundbreaking from a high-end gaming PC perspective.

The bad:
The biggest failure of this game is the game is too bloody easy. Literally. On a scale of 1-10 with ten being the most difficult game and 1 being easy, I rank this at a solid 3. I plowed through this game with minimal effort. The game has no harder difficulty setting that I could find.
I mean I guess I could intentionally die and power-up the orc chiefs/captains/warchiefs to get stronger, but I feel like that's a cop-out. Really, I should be rewarded with playing well, but the game gets way too easy. I died maybe 3 times the ENTIRE game and that was because I was being stupid and running around blowing up barrels to see what I can do in the middle of a fortress with the ENTIRE fortress coming down on me.
The fact that you can buy the last level powerups (the sword, bow, and dagger, unlimited executions without a skill tree requirement or prerequisite) basically meant that all I had to do was save up for that single powerup and then the game went into mind-numbing easy  mode.
The music was also very bland and forgetable.

Also, the storyline is simply forgetable. (I am aware it was intentional so that people who have no exposure to LOTR may play the game and like it and LOTR fans will like it also because of the nodding of the head at various plot points.) However, the game's script and pacing is just boring and awful. Eventually, I felt like I was just plodding through the game just to finish. I could care less about the ending or what happened. The voice acting may be top-notch, but literally the writing is god-awful. Sleeping Dogs had a MUCH better script and storyline, in my opinion.
I forgot to mention, I think I know why the game's story was so boring. Basically I thought about it today after work and came to the realization that the majority of the major storyline is basically GIGANTIC tutorials. They simply are tutorials on how to use a skill. Case in point a lot of your skills are locked until you progress through the story/mission and all of them can be named as such: (1) How to tame a gaugr; (2) How to Poison Grog barrels; (3) How to Brand an Orc; (4) How to Dominate an Orc; (5) How to Make an Orc a bodyguard; etc. There is no real emotional development or plot/story development, which results in you not caring because in the player's mind its ""Oh another tutorial, time to zone out and follow directions/instructions and just do what the button queues tell me to do.""

That is hardly a good way for you to make the player engaged in the story when you train them to think that the storyline is basically a tutorial. 

All in all, the game is well done and well polished. I think its an excellent entry/new IP but honestly, its only about 60-70% of the way there.

I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.

Updates for comments/clarification:
I am not saying the game isn't fun or it isn't a good game. I'm saying for what the game producers and makers goals and what they were going for it isn't simply there yet. It is sort of like the very first Assassin's Creed vs. Black Flag (which I believe is arguably the best title in their series). Black Flag or AC Brotherhood was a much better polished, developed, and I guess more matured/well defined game. This game is an excellent IP don't get me wrong, but the bar it tries to reach wasn't reached in this game.

I think its worth a buy (but honestly not at its full price at the moment). I got it on sale because of a screw up at $29.99. So yes. I think its still worth a play but not at the full price at the moment.

Finally, I am not a 15 year gamer. I'm just a veteran gamer? So basically, a game should have a good curve of fun/difficulty and I should feel like I got value out of the money that I spent on the game. Currently, I feel that the fun/difficulty curve is too shallow and the value I got out of the game is moderate to mediocre at best. The fact that the game doesn't have a difficulty setting that can be adjusted makes me kind of cringe. Yes you could manually try to make the game harder, but I don't see the point in intentionally dying. (I already have the HUD turned off...)

Final Update:
I played this game to 100% completion (I.E. All survival missions, all hunting missions, all outcast missions, fully upgraded, etc.) I would recommend this game if it was on sale. Its a good game and overall I would recommend people to play it but not at the current full price. There's way too many things that make this game a good game and not a great one. Granted, its probably the best currently in this new generation of games, but I would say its simply a good game and not a great game and stand by my review at 3.5 out of 5.

The TL;DR version to clarify on why so many people might be upset that I played this game throughly and still wouldn't recommend it at the moment.

The game is fun and is good, but there is a serious problem with the game overall. 
The game's primary selling point is the Nemesis System. The game's reward curve and overall lack of control/customization on the difficulty level of the game, results in an over-abundance in rewards and a lack of challenges. This results in the game no longer being challenging, which causes the player never/rarely to die, which in turn causes the game's PRIMARY SALES POINT (the Nemesis system) to be a secondary characteristic.

Basic questions I asked.
Why did I buy this game? Nemesis system and how it looks.
Is the game fun? Yes.
Should you play it? Probably.
Is it worth the hype and the money for the Nemesis System? No.
Is the Nemesis great or impressive? Don't know, the game's difficulty level (or lack thereof) made it pretty much a non-existent factor in my playthrough."
3416,3,0.7263,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Looking at this from the strict standpoint of a Lord of the Rings (and Tolkien and Jackson in general) fan, I would not recommend this to you if you are looking for an adventure in Middle Earth. More than anything, the story is highly generic. The gameplay is probably good to decent for an open world game, but there is nothing trying the gameplay back to the world of Middle Earth. 

The graphics are disappointing in my opinion....Mordor looks so subdued. You don't see fire everywhere like you'd imagine it to be. Which Mordor it a desolate place in the books, it is still supposed to be buzzing with lots of Orc and Uruk activity.

Also, the story has you playing as a lone ranger within Souron's Mordor, and it is completely fictional with respect to what Tolkien has written about Middle Earth. 

Again, if you come in expecting a great story and a travel back to the lands of Middle Earth, I recommend you staying away. If you want an open world action game with a nominal Lord of the Rings/Middle Earth skin, then yeah, perhaps this would suit you. 

Naturally, since I bought this for the story and narrative more than anything else, count me in as disappointed with the game."

Im done. I have had enough. The controls in this game are some of the most unresponsive in gaming history. Iv played plenty of games in this genre of action ranging from Creed ro Arkham and back again. This is beyond the worst.
The control scheme is perfect. The responciveness of the characters actions on the other hand, are useless. 100% console controller required(not tested, so maybe even that doesnt work).

-Install size is a lie.
-Easy to get whip lash going back and forth between stupid hard and mind numbingly easy.So no balance. At all.
--I mean you can get boss orcs that can resist knocks, melee, stagger, leaping over them, dodge ranged attacks and immune to stealth attacks... leaving bow attacks or having to detonate like 100% local area effects. Some of which they can also be immune as well. Like animals, some will instantly kill hostile animal spawns you set loose.
-No way to cancel out of horrifyingly long animations. Specifically the one that locks onto targets when you hit space(dodge) and tries to jump over them. But if you know they are immune... ofc you dont wanna do this. Fine... games got a garbage targetting system.... SO LET ME CANCEL THIS IN THE LIKE.... 1.5 seconds of my character running across the batlefield. So stupid design.
-Any reasonable part of the game is a solid 5-10 hours in. What kind of bs is that? The whole first 5 hours are almost the exact same game materal as the later content without the one skill that makes this game unique... and entertaining. Second playthough, couldnt even get through the grind.
-Camura zooms with different abilities and combos... so you cant see what the mob around you is doing. great fucking game design there assholes.

Its just extremely frustrating to try to handle this game. To the point at which it ruins the fun after a while... if your lucky enough to ignore it for the first play through.
This is impossibly infuriating to a level at which the game feels like the only challenge in it at all is overcoming the lack of character control."

A bigger issue at hand is the simple fact that monolith did away with directx9 support and so any hope of running this game is gone because you cant download or fix an issue of an outdated card.

It shows a lack or quality in the developer and just how out of touch they are with the world.  Most people arent buys a new pc every year and infact most make due with 5-8 year old pcs.  that monolith completely screwed anyone with a old pc is just frustrating and bad on their part.

The reviews are positive and the game seems to be getting a good approval except that OVER HALF OF CASUAL PC GAMES CANT PLAY THE DAMN THING.  If you are thinking about getting this game THEN DONT.  Most people cant run it and cant even start it and unless you have a very very current pc or one you have poured lost of money into fixing up then this is just a waste of money and dive into frustration and anger.

As a result i want my money back and i hope to never support monolith again and i would urge anyone who got fucked by this bad developing to do the same.  Just because you dont have the money to pour into a $2k pc whether is because of financial reasons or other dosent mean you should get punished and be unable to play.  Am i wrong?

Take this review for what you will. It's an ""okay"" game but not worth the 50 dollars* I paid for it. And yes, I have a bunch of downthumbs, but what do you expect? It's a Lord of the Rings game, people are going to praise it no matter what. I don't expect any LOTR fan to validate my opinion.

I'm kind of happy I bought this game though, it has taught me one thing, do NOT pre-order games. 

Overall: 6.5/10, and no, that isn't a harsh score, I honestly think I'm being lenient.

edit: Everyone thumbing me down are blindly staying true to the LOTR series and battle through this game, even if they don't enjoy it. I'm not going to do that, if a game is bad it deserves to be given a negative review, I don't care if it's my favourite series in the world. (LOTR comes close to that.)

2017 edit: It's been almost 3 years so I decided to give this another crack and low and behold, all my complaints are still completely valid. I would like to add that the game throws you into the deep end instantly without really any story buildup or character progression. You aren't able to upgrade your character for quite a while even though it keeps prompting you to open the upgrade screen and the controls feel clunky as hell (that is my biggest gripe.)
