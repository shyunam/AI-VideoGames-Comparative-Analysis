0,2,0.4008,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","Well I love survival horror and I LOVE Alien franchise ESPECIALLY first film so I so wanted to love this. But this game has no rhyme or reason. Missions are completely murky and not explained. The map is HORRIFIC and gives you no idea where you are going or why.
Items are so sporadic and then they make it next to impossible to craft something.
Robots can kill you with three grabs and it takes 18 melees to take them down. Wopeee this is so much fun.
Also, love the idea of 80s look, but it is wasted here . There are endless corridors that go nowhere and have nothing. There is almost never a reward for going off track, and the game does a terrible job telling you what track you should be on.
Story is really lame. You are on a ship with angry humans and an alien but no explanation is given for who these people are or how the alien got there.
Really poor poor   story telling.
The characters have zero color or personality.
The game can kill you whenever it wants with no logic.
I don’t understand positive reviews on this one . It’s like banging your head against the wall over and over.
Hard pass."

3,3,0.4719,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing",Decent atmosphere and good graphics for its day. But over-rated imo. The **** enemies just kill you in one second and I would have preferred more combat and not just stealth all the time. Repetitive structure. Good for a few hours but frustrating after that.
4,3,0.5496,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Played it in 2023, graphics keep up with dignity and the atmosphere is quite cool. Mayor issues with the gameplay, though. The worst I've played this year to be honest. The game mechanics are completely broken. You see the alien through a window 20 meters away, turn around and in one second you have it at your back. Sometimes enemies see you 100 meters away, sometimes don't notice you 2 meters away. You have a gun but can't kill with it even an android. So what's the point of it all? Playing it becomes really tedious. Making a difficult game is not about making it random, nor unfair. I deeply regret having bought it."
5,3,0.3697,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","A very contrived game that is kind of immersion breaking due to the Alien parts. The Alien doesn’t work in an Alien game. It moves all wrong on hind legs like a Tank and no wall crawling. It’s a one hit kill monster with god mode infinite health that cheat teleports all over the massive space station. When ever the Alien(s) appears it’s very contrived and immersion breaking.

Don't get me wrong it is cool to see all the Alien the movie style of analogue tech in a computer game. The game is is ok when facing off against humans and kind of fun when facing off against androids. At least the player has a fighting chance against those foes they can be killed/destroyed.

The clunky UI makes the player move like a geriatric. Yeah I get the limited save options at certain points was to create a certain amount of extra tension. As opposed to save anywhere at any time, but I found it just time wasting annoying and cheap when dying to the instant kill, god mode, cheat teleporting Alien.

Every games seems to need the obligatory crafting element these days, but it makes sense in a survival game using makeshift gear. Just throwing the very limited survival resources at the invulnerable Alien in god mode was a pointless drain. I only found the flametrhower the best quick fix to shoo the gawd damn thing(s) away anyway.

A missed opportunity for a really great game let down by really bad and cheap Alien game design."
6,3,0.854,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","The fact that the alien is there for 10 hours chasing you makes me think that this game is a bit repetitive. But for the rest, graphically it has aged very well since 2014. And the sound is incredibly good, as well as the setting that makes you feel horrified during the 15 hours of gameplay"
7,3,0.6669,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This may seem harsh, but when the weakest part of an Alien game is the Alien, that is inexcusable.  Seriously, you could remove the Alien from this game and it would be better.  There is nothing random about the Alien.  He is going to be close to you no matter what, the Alien doesn't obey the rules of the ship.  He gets to move in vents that you can't access.  It's really dumb.  Even when you know the scripted moment they put you in a dead end so you have no choice but to set off the scripted event.  Killed the immersion factor.  It's a linear game trying really really hard to make the Alien seem life like but it's just a SOLID FAILURE.  This game is still playable, just don't expect much from the Alien.  This game should should be called Isolation: ignore the Alien.  I was terrified when the Alien showed up, but not for long.  Sorry, I can't get over the terrible AI."

Having to construct supplies took getting used to, but it's a very creative and cool choice. The story was great, the cut scenes being better than some of the actual ALIEN films. ISOLATION isn't perfect, but if I've ever played a perfect game, the amount is less than 5, so that's not really a slam. The ending is shocking and impactful and awesome. The graphics are questionable at times, even in the remaster, but those are mostly great, too. Sometimes, the Alien is so difficult that it gets frustrating, but for the most part it's fine. The facehuggers are scarier than the Alien. They're frickin terrifying. ISOLATION definitely brings the horror, though, with one of the most all-around well-made games in existence.

If those mechanics are in place, then ""survival"" is based on your learning -- patterns, stealth, strategies, resources, etc. In Alien Isolation, you just die. You don't know why you died, or how to avoid dying the next time. You just die. Over and over again. If you survive, that survival is more likely a result of luck, not skill, not reason, not logic."

I like stealth games. But when enemies start to see you and say you make a noise when you were well hidden and standing still is really frustrating. I appreciate the fact that your human ingame and not invincible but you die way too easily. The fact you have to load a past save and cant save anymore is so frustratingly dated that its a wonder it was even used. The game is too unforgiving for little mistakes you make (and dont make) that doing things that took yoh a long time over and over when you get caught by the Alien makes it not very fun at all. I do not reccommend this game."

Alien Isolation is not what you are expecting it to be,The gameplay is stressful and unstable with a mix of repetitivity,The AI is
unpredictable which may cause some problems during gameplay,Save points are very poor systemized when you need to travel from point A to Point
B just to save!they should've added checkpoint autosaves.

The single player campaign is good lengthed but it's poorly told with no excitment at all it's really slow you'll get bored of it after an hour or two and you'll be wanting just to leave the game
ASAP.

The envoirment here is running on closed space ship and there's not too much left for the player except for those closed places in that ship IT'S REALLY
BORING ATOMSPEHERE.

Final Verdict:
It's another hyped game like Destiny,it may be slightly better than Colienil Marines and it's def. not worth your money and time,it could've been better but unfortuntely it's medicore
soundtrack and graphics may help to rise the rating up a bit but still it's not worth wasting your time."
28,3,0.5393,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","From my playthrough, the game was quickly showing it's hand as trial and error stealth. The atomsphere and attention to details from the movie is a nice treat but doesn't carry this game on it's own. The alien is also a nice thing to observe but it gets really boring hiding from the threats for the millionth time.

I've played many stealth and horror games and so far this game is all just set dressing and not much substance underneath all that neat art direction.

Then after watching some playthroughs I think I made the right choice ending my playthrough when I did, I'm definitely am going to get sick of this game only a few hours in. I do not understand the glowing praise around the game even having seen Alien movies myself."

It's a great game and definietely gives you a sense of dread with the alien following you around and you have to stay on your toes to hide. But.. when you lose 30 mins of progress because you can't find a damn save terminal and have to do it ALL OVER AGAIN.  I just lost interest at that point. I want to play this game, I think it has great atmosphere, but for a Dad like me, I just don't have time to keep repeating stuff over and over. 

One last thing, I SWEAR that alien is tethered to me. Even if I feel like I escaped without a sound or it knowing, it ALWAYS showed up in the next area no matter what. It just felt like the alien always ""knew"" where I was.  bummer

Attempt to crouch out of the room and hear the thing going back towards you. Get back to the locker, watch the alien sniff the room again, hold your breath, get out of the locker.

It has a good sense of style, and manages to capture that retro ""Aliens"" feel
The horror aspect is also handled well, and the game demonstrates good pacing in building tension/suspense during play

However, for me, it overstayed its welcome
There were a number of points within the game that just seemed to pad the runtime, with the next objective always being ""close but so far away"" and often for fairly whimsical plot reasons
While the game play was enjoyable, at first, the Alien quickly became a mere obstacle, and then simply an annoyance that stopped me from getting on with the story

Spent an hour+ trying to beat the first alien section, had to turn the difficulty down. Unbelievably tedious, absolutely killed the immersion set up in the first hour of the game.

Yet as the game continued it was the same button prompts, the same ""Oh they stopped you now do this"" or ""Oh no, you got captured not you have to return."" The game could've taken at least 5 hours worth of content out and it would've been fantastic. The aliens and androids lost their shock too soon.

Some good stuff first:
• Great graphics, they hold up well.
• Great atmosphere (first few hours).
• Responsive controls.
• Interesting narrative in the first half of the game.

What it completely fails at is maintaining a good balance between tension and cooling off time. Any horror classic or even just your average well made horror game, the loop is typically that of the atmosphere building some sense of dread, then you get monster encounters/ chases or scares and then you have your cooling off sections where you can roam around, find stuff, learn more about the story and the world, do puzzles and whatnot. That is an essential part of good horror games, at least for me.

In Isolation, either I got extremely unlucky and the xeno AI really had it out for me or that loop is entirely absent. Couldn't move anywhere without crouching or at any moderate speed or the creature and its insta-kills showed up immediately. Insta-kills, as countless poorly made horror games (mostly indies) have shown over and over again, absolutely destroy any semblance of immersion. After getting caught by it several times, I got so over it that I just turned indifferent to any kind of scares, I found myself playing your average keyhunt indie ""horror"" experience and the only reason I continued on with it was for the 100%.

Also, the game drags on incredibly hard after the first 5 hours or so. It feels like half of the game is just padding, like it should end at around half the playtime you can get with it but it just keeps going on.

For people like me that value a scary horror game over an overly stressful and even exhausting one, I would not recommend Alien: Isolation. Buy Outlast 1 or Amnesia: The Bunker instead, they are better than this game in every possible way."
52,3,0.4989,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I'm a big fan of the survival horror genre, stealth games like the Thief trilogy, and immersive sims like Deus Ex, System Shock 2 and Prey. Alien: Isolation should have been right up my alley - it captures the atmosphere of being on a ship like the Nostromo, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the game.

Imsims are about player choice - finding ways to solve a solution that even the developers didn't realise was possible. A good example is locked doors. Most games, you can only progress by finding the key to the door. With imsims, you can find a key, blow up the door, trick someone into opening the door for you, or find a way to bypass the door altogether. With Alien: Isolation, you turn on generators and find keycards - that's it, and it is very repetitive.

After three hours of this repetition, I finally came across a threat: the survivors trying to open a door who open fire on you. The stealth is not like other stealth games. Expect to be hiding in vents a lot, while the alien kills everyone for you if they fire their gun. 

I've read lots of complaints about the alien too, that it is always on top of you, so you die a lot breaking the immersion. This isn't good for survival horror. So the solution is to play on easy mode or install a patch that makes the Alien A.I. behave differently. This is not good when hard mode is touted as how the developers intended for the game to be played.

The game is also way too long. Even the biggest fans of the game agree with this point. Outlast - a very different kind of game - can be completed within 90 minutes when you know what you are doing. Sometimes short and sweet works better for horror than to drag the game on and on. Alien: Isolation should have been condensed, especially considering the gameplay is very repetitious.

If you are a big fan of the alien franchise, buy this game on sale. Otherwise - don't believe the hype."

*REPETITIVE - going a to path b solving a puzzle pushing a button to activate a door (your gonna do this the whole gome) nothing interesting

*UNFAIR - trail and error more than a survival horror game - sometimes ur gonna die unfairly because the alien spawns behind u or its right in ur path I died easily like 70 times or more on medium difficulty.

*UNNECESSARY LONG - Why creative assembly make this game so long ? there's isn't much things do to or experiment this has no sense this could be easily a 9hrs game with no rush again for being super repetive doung the same thing again and again.

ENDING WAS DISAPPOINTING - the only reason that I managed to complete this game is because I wanted to see the endinng a final epic cinematic not gonna spoiler but I thought I got the bad ending so I looked at youtube for the true ending and I just realized that was the real ending lol

FINAL THOUGHTS 
overrated game I attribute this because we  never had a decent alien game and that is why people liked but it is not at a 10 out of 10 game it could be 7.5 - 8 if u ask me.

A better alternative to this game if u wanna experience a real survival horror game: DEAD SPACE

Removing the alien for effectively 1/3 of the game killed pacing and almost made me quit. Human and androids just aren't scary. Threatening. Or fun. Except in the android graveyard room and they fumbled the bag by not having more jumpscares.

Gun combat is so terrible it should be a war crime. Enemies don't miss and shoot through objects, while shooting an enemy who is standing still - clips invisible walls.
The androids were great, but literally not even a threat. You can out slow walk them. Fuckin lol.

The game started out so well and was visually pleasing even today almost all the way through
The decisions to not include music late game during emotional scenes fully knocked the game down several pegs in ranking.
The space walking scenes? ARDUOUS and uninteresting for no reason.

From what I read, the only REAL ending is in one of the DLC's - And just re-uses the main ending... Pathetic guys.

66,2,0.5006,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","The game has all the hallmarks of a compelling stealth survival horror game, but it's undone by insufficient designer signposting which leads to ""die and retry"" immersion-breaking repetitiveness.

This game is a departure from the rest of the Alien/Predator video game franchise, as it's a slow-paced, careful game with heavy emphasis on collecting resources, avoiding combat, and exploration to find smart solutions not violent solutions. There's a crafting mechanic, as well as a focus on line-of-sight avoidance. Amanda Ripley's own backstory with her missing mother Ellen is wonderfully told, and the opening sequences let the player experience an interplanetary longhaul cryo-journey from Amanda Ripley's viewpoint.

The game is fairly linear, with set pieces in its NPC encounters and pacing. For the most part, this is a good thing, as the game tends to limit the chances for barking up the wrong tree, simply by its linear design (""this food kiosk that you just opened up when you restored power, has the key to your next progress, although you may need to search around a bit inside"").

However, one problem with linear design and scripted confrontation bottlenecks is, if the designers make one encounter a bit too obscure, it can bring the entire narrative momentum to a screeching halt.

I had a game-ending problem fairly early in the game, around Mission 3, where the game channels you into exploring a large stairwell foyer area. A scripted sequence features a woman firing two shots at you. Then an item pickup will trigger a manhunt for you, with the manhunt being quite unforgiving if played on Hard difficulty (the game's own recommended difficulty setting).

The scripting for this encounter is fairly pedantic, somewhat arbitrary, and I think perfectly encapsulates the game's limitations when it comes to encounter writing. These facts I largely found by Googling and watching Youtube, after learning that many other gamers had this problem at this point in the game:

1) I never realized that the game gives you an artificial grace period: the enemies will actually wait until you pick up a certain device before they start looking for you. After dying and retrying a few times, I came to believe that they'd look for you immediately after the woman runs away. With this belief, I favored retreating and trying to lure the humans out into the T-junction, which isn't a good tactic. At one point I believed I was actually sequence breaking and trying to finish an area incorrectly when I had missed something important, like a gun or door opener or something. This was not true either, and some better narrative signposting might have helped.

2) I never noticed the rewire nodes in the main stairwell, because - as mentioned above - I thought all the humans were coming after me immediately after I was detected and therefore discounted any exploration solution in favor of an urgency solution. The furthest I ever got was up one staircase and into an iris vent, but that just leads to another locked cargo room with a few unhelpful supplies, further reinforcing the ""designers don't want you to do this but there's no clear indication what they DO want you to do"".

3) The game recommends playing on Hard difficulty, so I did. This encounter might be a lot more reasonable on lower difficulty levels.

Eventually I caved and looked up the solution online, which seems to be very particular (""hide exactly here, go there at exactly this time""). Basically the designers expected you to read their mind for what solution they thought you should stumble upon, instead of provide any in-game indication of what they wanted.

I realized I was having more fun watching the Youtube runthrough than I was actually playing the game, and at less than 3 hours in, I've asked for a Steam refund and I'm just going to watch the game on Youtube. If the designers put an unavoidable bottleneck challenge into the game's main plot arc, and numerous people found this unreasonably difficult, it's probably better to just save yourself the cost of this game and watch somebody else play it for free.

(In its defense, watching somebody play this game will still probably make for a better movie experience than Alien Resurrection.)"

Coming back to it every year just to be disappointed. Makes me really sad.

First 2 hours are great, awesome atmosphere, an audiovisual masterpiece, but then you realise something's really wrong. And you notice just how awful the design is. 

Boring, annoying, repetitive. 
What really stings is the bad story comprising of endless fetch quests.

Alien AI is scary for the first 5 minutes. Then it just becomes annoying. If you try to play it stealthily you will die 20 times to complete a level and you will bore yourself to death. Trust me, I spent a few hours like this, googled tips. tried various gameplay styles and the conclusion is - this is NOT A STEALTH game.

The best way that every Alien:Isolation fan recommends is actually... cheesing the alien AI with gadgets. Forget stealth. Move around like you own the place, occasionally check where the alien is, throw noisemakers to attract the alien to unimportant locations. This way you will die only 5 times per level, but is it fun?

If the best way to play the game is contrary to the narrative premise... that means the game design is really bad. This is why most players stop playing after 1-2 hours. We were promised a suspenseful stealth game, but this is not it."

74,2,0.5275,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","Specific Problems: 

1. It is possible to infinite death-loop your save file.

2. Loading a save file does not clear enemies from the immediate area. See problem 1.

3. Nightmare difficulty mechanics are poorly thought out (You have to give up your whole save file and restart all progress to change difficulty setting. 

4. Nightmare difficulty makes it impossible to kill synthetics under its own game logic. Bullets and craftables are required to kill a synthetic. Bullets and craftables have an absurdly low spawnrate across all levels. This makes problems  1, 2, and 3 way worse.

5. This game is often praised for its AI. I have to disagree. The AI is indistinguishable to any other game in the genre (see assassins creed, splinter cell, outlast, ect.) There is zero noticeable in-game ""AI learning"" even on nightmare difficulty. 

Summary: 

Bottom line is this game does nothing exceptionally well. All of its mechanics have been ""genre norm"" since Penumbra Overture (Released 2001).  Its a horror game that slacks on the horror, its a stealth game that forces you into combat. The highlight honestly is the music and the overall art style, neither of which are unique to Alien Isolation, as they pre-existed in the on screen Alien universe."

And it really is at first. This game feels like you're living in an Alien movie for awhile. Soon enough, it becomes repetitive and frustrating, to the point where almost all of the suspense is gone. Once you get past how cool it is that there's an intelligent alien that could pop out at any moment, it feels like you've seen all the game has to offer. I'd find myself needing 10-20 attempts to clear a single section very often, even though I'm being careful and taking my time. I get that ""one screw up and you're dead"" can add to the immersion, but after enough attempts, it stops being scary and starts being annoying.

My issue may have been that I've been playing on Hard. I could drop to Normal, but the game itself states that Hard is the intended experience. You might be thinking ""you're probably trash."" Maybe you're right; all the other reviews seem to love it.

But it just sucks that I love horror games, stealth games, and Alien, yet I don't enjoy it despite everyone else liking it. I normally make a point to beat every game I start, but I had to uninstall this. I'll retry again in the future, and I'll change this review if I change my mind on it.

I died twice just figuring out the route (+20 minutes) I got to the next area (+10 minutes) and before I could get to another save location the alien cornered me, waited 3-4 minutes to find me, and killed me.

85,1,0.3587,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I regret buying this absolutely archaic garbage. My few points of contention:

1. The *you can only save in X location* is outdated saving design and should have stayed in the 2000s (if it had to exist at all). Losing time treading old ground without any actual reward if you had to restart for any reason is disrespectful to people's time. 
2. It has a slow, dull opening, which was also very far removed from being engaging. ""Prey"" did it so much better just 4 years later and is better bang for your buck now. 
3. The praises for its ""immersive level design"" are absolutely ridiculous. It's designed around going through a predetermined complicated path because you seem to lack any reasonable motor functions. No, you cannot just hop over a 30cm hole in the ground, you need to climb through 5 air vents, 2 shafts, and maybe slide down a trash chute to reach the opposite side. 
4. The puzzle of ""activate power"" being delivered twice in 20 mins and being the exact same button mash three times told me all I needed to know about the ""engaging"" pace breaking. 
5. And, what is both the most YMMV and most significant issue - it seems to have some really stupid limitations on new hardware (RX6800 and i7 10700 in my case) and bugs that shouldn't be there. Exempli gratia - I decided to alt + tab for a moment to check something else, jumped back in, and my frametime spiked by around 1000 %. Basically, I could only move extremely slowly. This is an issue that was resolved by exiting the game and going back to the main menu... just to be thrown back to a save point twenty minutes in the past. 

I absolutely regret spending money on this, even if it wasn't too much, there are way better games in this day and age and all the hype this game has received is beyond me. Nostalgia lenses, most likely. Come on guys, I know Ripley was hot, but she wasn't *that* hot that the mere memory of her under dressed (something immediately easter egged in the start of the game, as if it was not one of the cringiest aspects of the movie) shouldn't be enough to make this game feel like a dream come true."

87,3,0.3035,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This review is going to be very long and detailed, and contain spoilers. Read at your own risk. Bottom line, only buy this game if you are a diehard alien fan and understand its problems. Let it be known that I am no stranger to difficult games, I have played and 100%ed every soulsborne game, and play games like stalker gamma in my spare time.

This game is incredibly painful to review. From a production value standpoint the game is amazing, it really sells the atmosphere of the alien franchise extremely well and is generally graphically impressive while remaining optimized for older hardware. The sound design is also on point, staying true to the franchise while being technically impressive and enjoyable to hear. There are moments in this game that are genuinely scary, tense, and exciting, these standout moments will remain in my memory for years to come.

So why don't I recommend this game? In short, the gameplay. The alien ai feels unfair and is almost always tethered to the player, making for an unimmersive experience as the ship your playing is is quite large yet the alien is almost always somehow next to you. Using lockers seems to only be a bad idea 95% of the time, despite the game telling you to use them through the environment. The best strategy in dealing with the alien is either being extremely slow and methodical, only moving when you know you are safe to, or beeline it to the objective and hope for the best. While this may not sound bad in theory, using the methodical approach is EXTREMELY slow. This is because it is rarely obvious when it is completely safe to move, even when using the motion detector the game often fails to convey when you should or should not be moving. The game will also throw in occasional moments where the alien is guaranteed to know where you are,  throwing out any hard work and time you may have spent remaining undetected. 

The limited gameplay based around other enemies feels extremely undercooked and boring to engage with. While it may seem that you're always supposed to use stealth, there are several points in the game where you are supposed to kill all the minor enemies. The most egregious example being when you have to clear a very large room of cyborgs. The most effecient strategy is to use the shotgun, in which they take 2-4 hits to the head to defeat. They move very slowly and generally offer no challenge to defeat, just an amount of time that feels way too long. The cyborgs also almost never lose you when chasing,. Even though they walk at a snail pace they will know where you are for at least 3-4 rooms ahead of where they are even if you sprint away.

The alien's ai is famous in this game, but I do not feel as though it deserves its reputation. As previously stated the alien is almost always at most 1-2 rooms away from you, even if you have made no noise and it shouldn't have any way of knowing your vicinity. Despite almost always knowing the area you are in the alien will often not see you even if you are standing right in front of it. This happened several times in my playthrough where I was in reaching range of the alien while it was staring at me, but somehow didn't see me.

The game is too long, it took me about 14 hours to complete. This may not seem egregious but it is problematic for two main reasons. The gameplay variety is extremely limited, and there is a copious amount of backtracking. You are basically always doing two things in this game, stealthing and combat with smaller enemies. Stealth is very simplistic, you either crouch or slow walk to your objective while timing your movement to stay out of the line of sight of enemies, and you hide behind or under cover. Generally if part of you is behind something, the alien will not see you even if the cover only covers your knees (but for some reason human enemies can sometimes see you easier). Using lockers is usually suicide, the alien will often just camp outside your locker until it finds you or forces you out at a bad time. As previously stated combat with the smaller enemies is too dumbed down and simply not fun. Human enemies will walk in patrols, and shoot at you while standing still if they see you. I've had bullets go through walls and damage me multiple times. Cyborgs walk slowly at you and grapple you, and will somehow almost never lose you even if you sprint away. Facehuggers are reaction based, you either see them and shoot before they one hit you or you don't. There is at least one facehugger spawn that feels extremely unfair and creates a sense of trial and error, facehuggers often serve the purpose of forcing the alien to find you based on the sound of you shooting it. 

The story in this game starts decently strong but misses many of its most important beats later on. Side characters arrive and depart often in an unsatisfying manner and often feel like red herrings to the plot. The worst sin of the story is the ending, the last chapter of this game lasts about 2 minutes and ends on a complete cliffhanger. Seeing how this game never got a sequel I assumed the dlc would answer some questions about what happens next, but no, the only story related dlc's are prequels to the game. This leaves a bad taste in the player's mouth as there is absolutely no payoff for sticking to and beating this overly long and often tedious game.

This game shows an incredible amount of potential, especially in the first few hours. Unfortunately, this is let down by the game's execution in both gameplay and story. If the developers were given more time or perhaps a stronger direction then I am sure this game would have approached a 10/10. As it stands I cannot recommend this game for anyone who isn't a strong alien fan, and would advise much caution in those who are. In the end I do not regret committing to beating this game, but I am unsure if I will ever touch it again."

Instead of feeling disempowered and helpless at the hands of a stalking villain, you feel predisposed to solving the puzzles in order to escape rather than following a linear narrative that has horror elements involved. It's like endgame Dead by Daylight without any multiplayer elements or survivor choices. You can explore anything at any point, but the game doesn't do a lot to steer you in the right direction, making the experience aimless and feel full of a lack of any substance.

Most of my play time was spent waiting for the alien to give me even the teeny tiniest minuscule iota of a chance to do something without magically knowing that i've moved. There are noncancellable animations to accomplish something, which is when the creature teleports next to you and starts stalking toward you.  I never had immersion in the game because the first encounter with it was just comical because of the Xenomorph's ineptitude to notice me 2 meters from it.

The first few missions in the game are quite good, but at some point the game devolves into a really bad FPS game. That is to say, you will run around the different missions and not understand what the game wants you to do, all the while either humans, androids or the alien are chasing you. The AI ​​in the game is a joke, the androids only slowly advance towards you and still manage to catch up even if you run yourself. When it comes to normal people, you run around like a fool and try to kill them with your weapons while the alien doesn't care about them at all. The alien itself is also a joke, it's scary at first but after a while you just get angry when it's around. Since it can kill you with just one hit, you need to play carefully when it is in the same room. The problem is that it either knows exactly where you are or it gets stuck in a loop and doesn't know where to go. Once you get some weapons that can actually do something against it, it's not scary anymore. The game is also way too long, it should have been like 7h max and not the 16h+ that it took me to play through. In the end I just ran through every level because I wanted the game to end.

I tried so many times to love this game and finally ""get it"" but sadly I've come to the realization that it just fucking sucks. I understand that this is a stealth game, but the actual stealth aspect itself is absolutely horrendous. You can't move more than 5 feet without being detected, you have to pretty much crouch through the entire game or you're going to get ass blasted every 30 seconds, even on the lower difficulties. Once you are detected you have to find a locker and sit in there forever as whatever enemy you triggered patrols the area as thoroughly as fucking possible. These motherfuckers inspect every room, every corner, every surface, every crack in the wall and make sure every dust particle is undisturbed before they give up. The sheer amount of bullshit, out of my control moments this game punishes you for is insanity.

126,1,0.4619,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","This is one of the most boring games I've played.  And the root cause of it is, unfortunately, the xenomorph itself.  The game is designed to be slow, in an attempt to make it more 'strategic' or 'tactical'.  That means even basic things like reloading a weapon require you to hold down a button while your character loads rounds one at a time.  That in itself isn't bad.  The game is paced around that when dealing with human or Working Joe enemies.  However, in order to balance that around the indestructible xenomorph, they made it lumber slowly through hallways, stalking the player like it's Jason Voorhees.  Something no xenomorph in the movies ever did.  They are fast, agile ambush predators.  They hide in vents, they climb walls, they hang from dark ceilings waiting to strike down at unsuspecting prey.  They DON'T walk very slowly through circular hallways while the player hides in a locker.  That wouldn't prevent them from finding you anyway.  Another issue with the game.  Things like a slightly foggy room are enough to make the xenomorph unable to see you from 6 inches away.  Apparently this xenomorph hatched from Mr. Magoo.

If the game used the xenomorph sparingly, used its presence to punctuate tense areas, escapes that made you have to figure out how to distract it, disable pathways, and run to an exit into another area where you lose it for another good portion of the game, when you're then forced to deal with the humans and Working Joes again, it would be a significantly better game.  Instead you get prolonged areas of an hour or more where you're just playing hide and seek with lockers as the xenomorph is always no more than two halls away from you, and you have no way of knowing if it's safe or not to come out of the locker.

The story seems interesting.  I love the main character, Ellen Ripley's daughter who's also a mechanic and thus uses various tools she picks up to open areas of the station bit by bit.  But the overuse of the universe's dumbest xenomorph and the incredibly boring hide-and-seek sections where you spend most of your time staring at the inside of a locker door just kill this game for me.  When Colonial Marines is not only more entertaining, but even with the broken AI has more accurate xenomorphs, then your game is just not worth playing."

135,2,0.4769,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","This is a decent game, but sadly I often found it more annoying than fun. The plot, characters, environments, enemy design, sound design, and music are all solid, but there are major gameplay issues. 

The gameplay has some major problems that drag down the experience. The general controls and exploration gameplay is great. The problems arise when it comes to enemy AI and the gameplay around them. There are three types of enemies in the game with some variation in each category. Humans, Synthetics, and Aliens. The gameplay with the first two types works great. Fighting them is exciting and the stealth mechanics are mostly solid, though I encountered a couple issues with them seeing me through walls or them getting stuck in place. It's a lot of fun getting these two types to fight when you can or luring the Aliens to the humans. The Aliens aren't hostile to synthetics and as far as I can tell there isn't a way to make those two groups fight. It would've been nice if there were a way to provoke conflict between them, but that's not a huge deal.

The real issues are with the Alien gameplay which, unsurprisingly, is at the core of the game. All the Alien enemies can instakill you immediately on contact and there are no QTEs or escape items to save you. That's a very risky approach when it comes to a stealth game. If everything isn't right on point, it can get frustrating very quickly. Sadly, the Alien AI is very buggy and they behave in ways that make no sesne. Multiple times during a single play through I had an Alien glitch through a solid wall or floor and instakill me. I also encountered times when the Alien's tail would clip through objects or walls resulting in the alien catching me even though I wasn't even in the same room. Glitches aside, the Alien AI hovers around you and camps your objectives in a way that makes not sense for the context. Why would the Alien know to camp a specific switch? It doesn't know what the switch does and there's a huge map for it to patrol so why does it just walking in a 5 foot radius around my objective? There are some weapons/items that can scare the Alien away, but supplies can be scarce so it's very annoying to need to waste them scaring off a Alien that's stuck in an AI loop (for example jumping in an out of the same vent dozens of times in a row) or is camping an objective.

These issues are exacerbated by the save system. You can only save at set points and those points are distributed very illogically. Some sections have long sequences with no save points, while overs seem to have a save point every other room. If the devs consistently used one of those approaches, I would think it was intentional but the fact that they flip flop level to level makes me think that it's just poor design from devs that didn't know what they wanted to do.

There are a few levels in the game without the Alien and those levels are excellent. You get to fight the humans and synths and use all the fun weapons you picked up. When the Alien is around using a weapon summons it, so it usually isn't worth the risk of instakill. Which make one wonder why the game gives you all these weapons when they are basically useless for 80% of the game? Eventually, the glitchy, bad AI mess that is the Alien comes back and the game becomes a chore again.

Due to all these issues, the game also dragged terribly and felt far too long. The horror elements are also very weak, so I wouldn't recommend getting it for that aspect. 

Overall, if you like the Alien movies, this game captures them quite well from a visual and audio standpoint. It's just a shame that certain parts of the gameplay are some broken that they drag down the whole experience. I would give this game like a 6/10 for Alien fans, mostly for the visual, audio, and plot elements. If you don't mind dealing with all the jank and resulting frustration, there is some enjoyment there, but know what you're getting into. I recommend only getting it on deep, deep sale.

If you aren't already an Alien fan or a Stealth game fanatic, I would probably pass, since this game is largely a love letter fans of those movies and has many issues weighing it down."

This could have been fantastic if it was more like Dishonored controls. One of the most limiting actions is no Jump facility - I mean just to jump over desks (not 10 feet into the air!).
I find it extremely disappointing because I can see that with a few less key strokes and more intuitive control this could have been amazing - such as sliding past androids etc.
Personally I am not a fan of ""save stations"" - like others have said I like to be able to save and come back to the game later (I do have a real life!).

Some synths are hostile, some aren't, and there's no way to tell until they grab you or start chasing you down. For whatever reason, the alien completely ignores them, even though you find them ripped in half presumably by the fucking alien. Save spots are hit or miss. One minute their spoon feeding you one after every 15 feet, next thing you know you gotta go through multiple levels and flip a bunch of switches all in one shot. Game is just a hot mess and I do not get how it got such good reviews from so many people. I should have returned this instead of hoping it would get better as I progressed."

You know, I was genuinely enjoying this game until Mission 5. The alien (even on easy mode) is still incredibly challenging to avoid. I've tried distractions and even still it just instantly targets me. I personally think the game needs some balancing, but I understand that people don't really care about that.

The controls are extremely awkward and slow to respond to input and no I don't have a slow PC. Being stalked by the Alien Xenomorph quickly becomes boring. You find yourself creeping around hiding whilst it marches around like an angry parent being forced to participate in a game of hide and seek with a disobedient child.

The game is also buggy as hell. The androids get up to all manner of physics defying shenanigans, which ruins the look of the game. The automatic plot points don't always activate, even after reloading and so I'm then forced to restart a level from scratch.  The game's capricious physics, ham-fisted controls and buggy androids became so extreme in the level where you're trying to access the Apollo core that the game became just too frustrating to play.

It's a damning indictment of an expensive game when someone who's spent the last 30 years playing video games walks away in disgust 85% of the way through the game and watches the end few levels on somebody else's play-through on YouTube.

[spoiler](the Alien supposed to be dead, I send him out into space with the whole station. I don't know what will happens now, seems now is survival against humans and malfunction androids)[/spoiler].

The game is slow and very linear. You may explore other rooms, but why? You'll only find a death end, maybe resources, maybe you can find a shorter path, and if you are have luck the Alien may down from the vent to hunt you, now what? You need to wait to return.

After you first encounter the Alien, he will stick with you almost entirely, running and screaming in the vents, even if you travel between stations or use elevators. Any weapon is pointless, the game is about seek, stealth and hide (but not quite, sometimes the Alien just found you), you'll never run, you only crouch during the entire game. If you use the flamethrower, the Alien will become very aggressive, and you will never move forward. The Alien is not scary as other people say, only the first couple of levels, after that it'll be usual.

I'm not sure if I'll finish the game, I bought the game years ago in a sale because I'm a fan, however this game is not for me. I can't find the game good but neither bad.

EDIT: Still playing, four levels of boredom, playing 16 now. The only weapon you will use the most is the flamethrower against the Alien. Every mission from the start is to reboot or power something on the ship from one end to the other, when you finish something, something else needs power or gets damaged somehow, and you need to go to the other end of the ship to turn it on, then repeat throughout the game.

EDIT2: I force me to finish the game, if it is not now, I'll never finish it. Overall the game is very bad, bland, annoy, and fu-ck-ing long, you crawl all the game, to move from one locket to another with wait in between until the Alien go away, and you always need to power something during the entire game, on top of that the game is slow for everything, to walk, to run or when you do some action like open something.

I know there are people that like the game, but this game is not for me. I prefer to think when I play, I prefer action, puzzle, logic, tactics, but in this game you found nothing."

It looks great.  Quickly you figure out your character moves with agonizing slowness.  Everyone is a jerk.  Spent a long time clunking around in the dark with agonizing slowness.  Finally took out one of the jerks with a melee to the dome.  Jerk drops his revolver and ammo all over the place.
Search him.  Get all the ammo.  The revolver clinks along on the floor, ungrabbable, unselectable.  Other jerks coming down the hall to get me.  Manage to bash another one's head in.
Now there are two unselectable revolvers clattering around on the floor.  I can kick it and step on it, but I can't pick it up and use it?
Get shot by the third jerk because apparently I'm too stupid to pick up a revolver and shoot him first even though I had like a good thirty seconds of screwing around before he showed up to do me in.

167,1,0.7688,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","7th hour - just completed the 5th mission (out of like 20?). I had to find a keycard in a medical facility patrolled by the alien. The medical area is a large circle with locked doors. Unlocking a door opens up another section, and opening another locked door there gives you another large circle with lots of rooms to hide in.

Unfortunately the alien has been programmed to stay near you, or when it wonders too far, return to you. The alien never patrols the areas you leave as you expand its and your access. It's always near. So the whole process is slow while you sneak room to room with your scanner out always looking over your shoulder.

Considering it walked by me multiple times as I hid and it never found anyone in the medical facility (until scripted later), doing circles over and over, you'd think it would give up its search and let me explore freely. It is a game but it kinda broke the immersion for the sake of ""now you will just sneak around for hours till you unlock that last door"".

The area before the medical facility had patrolling androids to avoid by sneaking around. That was more fun to deal with. More like the gameplay of Dishonored and Hitman that I enjoy. I expect the game has more of all of the above but I've stopped playing. A more forgiving save system may have saved it rather than the specific save points.

I'm a fan of the movies. In the movies people hide and stay still. The alien leaves the area and they can come out of hiding."

I know nothing about the Alien series and haven't watched a single movie but I think Amanda was supposed to die from the beginning... Which for me personally it feels like a slap to the face to sit thru 20 hours of surviving and especially dying just to have what I feel was the only good character (not saying much since she was the protagonist) just get shit on by an alien. Beautiful game, cut scenes were rlly low-fps for some reason. The Alien itself and all other NPCs were done very well. Except for the human/companion NPCs they did not act real at all. In the campaign mode, I feel like it almost gave you a little too much freedom, or could've made the paths a little more obvious. Because at times I found myself looking up gameplay videos just to find where to go next, and eventually I found that the motion detector guides you to where you need to go in the ladder-half of the game (which pissed me off) but I feel like the game relied too heavily on it once I did discover it."

-When you hide in a locker go get a snack because it takes 30+ seconds for the alien to leave. It's immersive and scary peaking out the locker slats waiting for safety the first time - very boring the 50th time.

And don't you dare get impatient, for the save states are few and far between, meaning one hasty pinky extended outside the safety of that gum-encrusted desk space before the alien is good and ready to let you go means you'll be set back half an hour of riveting ""watch paint drying"" action

As an aesthetic experience, it's doing interesting, high-quality stuff. As a videogame, it quickly grows frustrating and boring. I quit less than halfway through and watched the rest on youtube.

If you get spotted, you die. This kind of first-person stealth just isn't fun. To design a 20-hour game around this mechanic is really wild. I applaud Creative's ambition, but I don't think they solved that core problem. 

It's a beautiful moment when the alien first makes its entrance. My nails had never been more raggedly bitten. But, a few hours later, I had seen every death animation ten times each and just didn't care anymore. I was sick of staring blandly at the inside of locker doors, waiting for the footsteps outside to go away so I could get back out there and fiddle the thingy.

It's possible my frustrating experience was partly my own fault. I first set the game to Hard, identifying as a capital-G Gamer and lover of sci-fi horror. I wanted a more visceral, edge-of-seat experience. But the danged thing can get into the vents on hard mode! As my frustration grew, I thought about starting over on Normal, but the damage had been done. If you play this, don't make the same mistake I did, and keep things easy. Instant death mechanics are punishing enough.

All that said, I would love for Creative to try this again. This game has atmosphere in spades. If they can find a way to fix the problems with first-person stealth, or just diversify the gameplay more, something like this could easily become a mainstream classic, rather than just of the cult variety."

The opening couple of hours are exciting, being able to explore the ship and the grand build up to the reveal of the alien were really fun and tense. Yet once the Xenomorph becomes your stalker enemy, things really got tiring and fairly frustrating. The game became a mixture of hiding and luring over, and over again.

The graphics while good, they are not as impressive as they were when it was released. The gameplay is repetitive and monotonous, with the player spending most of the time hiding in lockers. The AI of the alien is often inconsistent and can be easily exploited. The game's story and characters are uninteresting and poorly written. The game's save system is unforgiving and can lead to frustration. The game's lack of variety in enemies and environments makes it feel like a drag to play. Overall, I would not recommend Alien Isolation to anyone, there are far better survival horror games on the market that offer a more satisfying and terrifying experience.

237,1,0.4845,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I really wanted to like this game. It has everything that I'm looking for in a horror game, including a space-based setting, multiple different enemy NPCs (alien, android, and human), and a tense atmosphere. 

Unfortunately, the game falls flat in most dimensions. 

For starters, the game is extremely mundane. The game loop following the following pattern:

1) You start at location Y and need to retrieve X.
2) You get X, but can't get back to Y using the path you used to get X. 
3) You need to find a new way to get back to Y. 

As of this review, I've played for ten hours and I don't feel like I've made any more progress. By that I mean I feel like my character is just as far-off as she was when she first landed on the ship (and I've completed 50% of the game). 

Moreover, the controls feel jerky, and the weapons are virtually useless. No weapons work against the alien, and the androids are indestructible until much later in the game. I've collected a bunch of items, but haven't used any of them (other than a single heal). What's the point of weapons if you don't use them?

As for the fear factor, it's almost non-existent. Yes, the music picks up when the alien is near you, but the primary threat against your character (the alien) doesn't scare you after you've been conditioned to dying. It's also not only boring, but also frustrating. Dying doesn't feel like you've been outplayed, it feels like the games' AI just happened to work against you. By that I mean that the alien rushes in a random direction every now and then, and if you just so happened to be in its path, you die. Also, I noticed the alien hangs around for too long sometimes. By that I don't mean that it's hanging around because it detects you, I mean that the alien is clearly programmed to just stand around you when you're hiding. I was in a locker for around 5 minutes while the alien was strafing back and forth in front of me. 

What's more is that save-stations are scarce and I find myself back tracking to the save location several times before continuing to the next objective. If you are four objectives into a mission, and die, you'll start at the beginning of the mission if you haven't found a save-station, as native saves initiated by the game are scarce. 

As you travel throughout the ship, you'll read through logs written by crew members before your arrival. Due to the game dynamic, where the alien can come out of any vent, it becomes hard to focus on reading the ship's logs when you have access to them, as you need to keep an ear open for any sounds you hear. I found myself reading a single log four times just to internalize what was written since I was preoccupied with not dying.

Overall, I feel like this game is a drag at this stage. I've pulled myself to mission 9 (out of 18) and don't plan on continuing because it feels like I'd be continuing not because I'm enjoying myself, but just because I want to finish. I got this game on sale for $7.99, and put in ten hours (so, in a sense I got my money's worth). But in hindsight, I got caught-up in the YouTube review hype and pulled the trigger on this game when I really shouldn't have. At least I did not pay the full (non-sale) price of $39.99.

Based on my experience, I give this game a 4/10. I'll be holding off on space-horror until the Dead Space Remake."

Its bad enough I have to move at a hindered movement speed since infinite sprint takes away from the realism and ""tension"" horror games try to convey but here, all does is pad out a shallow, boring and frustrating escort mission with a character i literally could care less about from a responsible 5 mins long section (which i would argue is already way to long) but somehow this game managed to stretch it over the course of an ENTIRE CHAPTER! Its like the game is literally brainstorming ways to make the beginning as miserable and painfully tedious as possible as to artificially inflate how long the playtime is with so much needless padding for just the beginning two hours. Why would I want to keep playing a game where your only objective is to sneak from one chapter to the next with barely any gameplay, unless you somehow count hiding in a locker for 10 mins at a time as innovative and fun from an enemy who is completely IMMUNE to all your attacks but a flamethrower that you don't get until what 8 hours into this snoozefest? The game really wants me to just walk around sneaking and ""pretending to be scared"" which SPOILER it isn't unless you count cheap B rated jumpscares and ""Spooky sounds"" as scary like GTFO here. The real kicker is when you finally do meet the alien after such a shallow and boring intro that you would think you'd see him longer than a whole 4 minutes but no instead. you just load into the next area where you do the same boring crap you've been doing for the past two hours. If i wanted to just walk around for hours on end with no gameplay in between i would have gotten a game like death stranding or just gone outside and touched some grass than play this. Game is just beyond boring literally zero desire to ever give it another attempt much less go any further."
242,1,0.4184,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Tedium the game. 

I tried to play through this game on several occasions and came to the following conclusion. The designers of the game made a few fatal mistakes and in so doomed the game to be boring. 
1. There's not much going on for a lot of it. Of course you could make the argument that it's supposed for you to soak in the atmosphere and the graphics help. Have you played Dead Space? System Shock? Yeah, you've already soaked in the atmosphere. 
2. Alien worked on multiple levels because at the time, the story was novel. Not only do you **not** get an exploration of an alien planet (which would have been fun), generic space station orbiting Jupiter (I know it's not but c'mon), is also unremarkable. You have human enemies, humanoid enemies, and the alien. The alien is implemented competently, the humanoids are implemented not too terribly, the working joes are implemented well. But two decisions: one to have save stations, and two to not have any checkpoints mean that if you're not giving the alien's braindead AI the berth to fuck off and the RNG gods are against you, you have to go through all of what you did before. And you can't really go through it quickly, because the game punishes you for ""running"", a speed which I would describe as a 100kG asthmatic's attempt at a brisk walk. Incidentally, it also makes ""noise"" which means that you have to mainly either waltz through rooms, or crawl through them.  

If it's your third reset in a row, because the Alien is a one hit kill that refuses to go away and you didn't buy ""sitting in a vent the game"", you start noticing that the design decisions are bafflingly stupid. 

3. The ""plot"" is paper thin. In this game like in Soma and in Amnesia, you have mostly walking sometimes crafting, hacking minichores, the scavenging minichore, and the ""wait for alien to go away"" minichore. So the person playing this game should be interested in what'll happen next. If you had characters, interactions and something to the effect of interesting stuff happening it's not a problem. I remember being very emotional once I beat Soma. Amnesia was equally entertaining, though the plot there is a little less deep. Alien isolation by contrast thinks that rehashing the films (badly I might add) is worth the game's price. 

4. The animations to any minichore. I'm all for animations, but as long as they are used properly. The one thing which could have been animated without much impact on gameplay (picking up objects) is not animated. Being forced by the game to go into hiding in a room with one exit and waiting for the A""I"" of the alien to go away is animated. Getting out of it is also animated. Going into vents is animated. And often an ordeal that could have been you just pressing one button comes down to you pressing one button, having a jarring pause, pressing another button, having another jarring pause, and waiting until input is enabled again to produce yet another input. I know what they were going for, and if the save spots were put in more places, or the alien wasn't a one hit guaranteed kill if it sees you, I would have said, yeah, imeersion. But no."

Turning off every video option and switching them on one at a time revealed that the DOF option is the issue.   What a stupid option, but OK, maybe some people enjoy playing while looking through glass smeared with petroleum jelly?  It's like playing with your eyes open while under water at the pool.  Whatever.  For me, it was so blurry it made my eyes water and gave me a headache. 

Regarding game play, after some opening cut scenes explaining the context, you get to ""walk"" (slow as a snail-- even the shift key for running is slower than an old lady with a walker) around in the dark while trying to figure out how to get through some locked doors.   If you enjoy these types of ""puzzles"" in  games, maybe you'll enjoy this.  For me it's like one of those Hallmark, chick-flicks where nothing actually ever happens, but the scenery is nice-- only in the dark while moving like a sloth.    

Maybe it gets better later on, but apparently to get to the good part you need more patience than I possess.   After an hour of searching in slow-motion in the dark with nothing happening, I'm done.  Maybe I'll give this another try if I run out of other games, and I'm really bored.  (I mean REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY bored)."

The working Joes are creepy, the humans act as you would expect. However ..., everything else is garbage.

After four hours I had to give up. Played on Hard mode as the game recommends it, but the Alien AI is garbage.
It doesn't want to leave you alone, it doesn't leave, the motion sensor doesn't have enough range to detect the Alien at all. By the time it appears or you hear it, it will be too close because it moves fast. The first two sections where it hunts you broke me. Completely pointless. The Alien is tethered to you so even if you manage to distract it, it will get close to you in about 50 seconds. So you die and die again. Eventually you stop caring much about looking around and just wing it and start walking to the objectives. You may or may not die when, but at least you get where you need to.

Not worth the time. Life is too short to finish fetch quests by trial and error, because you don't have the tools or the options for much maneuvering. Not to mention the horrendous mini-games for opening doors etc.
Just a waste of time, as it is.
If the Alien wasn't artificially so attached to the player it could be great, but this way... Forget it."

247,3,0.7029,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I will say, I overall enjoyed my time with this game, but I still kind of don't recommend it. Its definitely not what you might think the game is, its main focus isn't just being solo and stalked by an alien, like its a good bit of that, but if that's what you think the whole game is, its not even close. Its almost resident evil-esque, but not that far as you cant kill things that easily.

The material of course is great and the aesthetics and everything is pretty awesome. The graphics still mostly look pretty great and the lighting can be fantastic. With low light and great lighting, games can look like real life sometimes, and that definitely happens here in Isolation.

Now onto the bad stuff...

Glitches. 
Game is 8 years old and there is so many glitches, its like its a day 1 release for games that come out nowadays. A lot of glitches were sound glitches. Like doing a kill animation and it goes dead silent and then just has a weird shuffling sound that wont go away unless you reload your save. The weirdest one is a really weird slow motion glitch which I haven't seen in any other game. The game just goes into this slow-motion movement with your character like a scene out of a movie, but its not epic or cool, its really annoying.

Now onto the worst...

Saving is horrendous, dying makes you redo a lot of things that could of taken a long time and just makes it frustrating and not scary. 
There was one part in particular that took me like 30 tries because of something stupid like a person aim-bot flick shooting me once, when they didn't even see me while androids are attacking them and its a pretty long section. It was just so infuriating and made you wonder if anyone even play tested this crap. That was honestly the worst part of the game and its crazy that they didn't think of changing it in any way.

Lastly, the ending was pretty disappointing to me. Not satisfying in any way and I just wish they would of committed to something more meaningful, or anything at all."

Alas, there is not, so I'm forced to round down to the red thumb. This game has great atmosphere. It has great ideas, too. Sometimes it has great execution. Other times it has incredibly poor execution, and that's ultimately the reason why I'm siding with the red thumb here. Also, while there are no spoilers in this review, I go into enough detail that you will infer certain things about the game (at the very least things that will affect how you approach it mechanically) by reading it.

To cut a long review short, the overwhelmingly greatest issue is that the game is about 4-6 hours too long for its own good. The last 1/3rd of the game is a total mess of poor pacing, frustrating level design and multiple -- a good 3 or 4 -- points where the game could (and should) have ended, but did not. It all feels like a very long, climactic ending sequence, except the climax goes on so long it becomes physically painful. I'm not kidding; I finished this game with a splitting headache, glad that it was over and done with. Before that point it's a pretty good game, though.

My main complaints aside from the last 1/3rd of the game would be that many of the mechanics aren't explored very well. In a metroidvania-like fashion the game teases you with areas that you can see but don't have the tools to unlock yet, but none of these actually contain anything particularly interesting in them. There's no New Londo shortcut here, only some rooms you can go out of your way to backtrack to in order to get some extra loot you probably don't even have the inventory space to carry.

There's also an incredibly wide variety of gadgets, but I never actually found a use for most of them. The game gives you a plenty of loot, at least on Hard, to use these gadgets very liberally, but there's seldom any reason to do so. I didn't throw a single flashbang or smoke bomb or pipe bomb. I tried to use the noisemaker distraction gadget, but half the time it would bounce off a wall (sometimes an invisible one), land at my feet and attract the alien to me. I used the EMP and molotov exactly once. Also, apparently you're able to use most of these gadgets as mines to set traps, but there wasn't a single point during the game where I found any use for this mechanic.

Finally, the alien AI can be frustrating. The alien is on your arse nearly all of the time, and when you successfully evade it, it'll [i]just so happen[/i] to decide to move away from the area you were previously in and into the area you are currently in. There are also times where it just refuses to stop patrolling through the area, stopping you from doing your objective. Distracting it is usually unreliable at best and suicidal at worst (and more often than not, the outcome is the worse one). There are a couple of very bad spots like this early on, but most of the awfulness regarding alien encounters and level design is in the last 5 hours of the game. Tiny, cramped levels consisting of 2-3 rooms where the objectives force you to walk back and forth multiple times with the alien on your tail all the time.

Anyway, as far as movie games go, this one isn't bad. In fact it's probably as good of an Alien game as anyone could've hoped for. I just wish it knew when to stop."

The save functionality... sure it's cool but it's also way to punishing and having to do the same part over and over and over again is the worst. You're gonna spend most of your time crouched in the game because sprinting is useless. You cannot out run anything so have to slowly crawl your way through each level. There are some good elements like graphics (except cut scenes all human faces just look goofy), the hacking mini game, and strategically turning off and on systems and other electronics to make your escape. But none of it makes up for the terrible AI that just hovers over you like a helicopter parent so you can't make any progress and the terrible combat that is useless and doesn't even need to be in the game.

There are also quite a few logs to read and audio logs to listen to, which I would've enjoyed but for the fact that the game doesn't pause for you to do that, so I started just ignoring them, which further increased the blandness and frustration.

262,3,0.4538,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","To make a long story short:  not going to give this Alien-themed game a thumbs up.

Too slow a burn with the creep around gameplay.  6.5 hours in and I still haven't seen an Alien, just a bunch of other humans trying to kill me.  Whack one to death with a wrench, only to find out I can't pick up their gun lying there on the floor.  Of course, I'm ""given one"" a few minutes later on a table.  Far too obvious a gate, and totally immersion breaking.

Part of the attraction for the Aliens series was that the aliens were hunting the humans, not ""everyone hunting everyone"".  The sense of betrayal among humans in this game is overwhelming, and not at all realistic.  I was actually disappointed in the way the narrative pushed the humans around.  Felt even worse than Survivor on TV with the absolute denial of any rationality at all.  

Object placement in the world for materials is bland.  Crafting is bland.  Shooting is bland.  I get the feeling I'm still playing the tutorial when most games would be several hours into full-swing.  And it's not at all stressful; there's not a hint of tension or fear.  Guess that comes in from hours 10-20.  So perhaps the second half of the game is better than the first?  I may not keep playing to see it, which is unfortunate for someone who's seen Alien and Aliens perhaps 40 times combined.

I get the point it's not a shooter-looter.  It's supposed to keep you as ""the prey"" and scared.  It's a horror survival game.  But in my opinion (having played the Alan Wake series), not a good one.  Bored is how I'd describe how I feel after six and a half hours.

Unless you get this on a fantastic sale and can't wait to see the interior of a ship that vaguely resembles those from the series, give it a miss and save some money."

As some have said, it's way too long. [/spoiler] Healing taylor and helping samuels is just useless forced side-quests [/spoiler] The spacewalks are to slow. and you can't skip cutscenes.

The Alien goes from scary to annoying due to long gameplay (thank god for the flamethrower). Gameplay is good but it gets repetitive, and in a 14h game or so, that's pretty bad. Quite a few bugs as well.
The story is also pretty simple. I wish we could have gotten better npc interactions, but what we get are text logs.

But closing off the game by making it hard to find tools needed to open up other areas of the game is not the way to scare me. It just bores me.

You've got all these items, gadgets, and cool interiors to explore...but then the game constantly forces you to move at a snail's pace. It's worse when you're following story NPCs because the game literally forces you to walk--sprinting is completely disabled. 

I guess it's my own fault. I shoulda done my research, but this is not what I want from the Alien franchise.

One thing worth noting is that the game runs amazingly even on my outdated 1660 Ti. I'm sure that's due to the proprietary engine the developers created."

This game has so much going for it although the story is full of the usual Science Fiction horror cliches.
The Alien franchise, great environment design, good sound, interesting survival horror gameplay elements.
But it is all ruined by confusing stealth mechanics and the omnipresent Alien that will always (!) gravitate towards you.
You will spent 20 minutes sneaking around the Alien, distracting it, getting past it to a new area...just for the Alien to suddenly pop up right next to you again. Then you die and now you can do the 20 minute sneak section all over again.
Problem is, the second time is no longer fun but just extremely tedious and the atmosphere is gone. Also, this time you already know that the Alien will pop up right next to you anyway in the next section which makes it even more frustrating to carefully sneak around it again for 20 minutes. Overall an extremely frustrating experience.
There are mods that address this issue, making the Alien less omnipresent and all-knowing. I would recommend playing the game only with one of those mods installed. 
Another problem are the many scripted encounters with the Alien and other survivors which just seem a bit off. The stealth mechanics are not that good either since you never really can tell if enemies can see you or not. Sometimes crouching in a bright room behind a chair is good enough, other times you crouch behind a table in a dimly lit room but you are spotted instantly. Since the game seems to also be way too long for its own good, I decided to not bother with it anymore."
271,1,0.634,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Holy crap is this ""game"" insulting.

It doesn't respect the player's time AT ALL. Everything is suuuuch a chore, Jesus Christ.

The atmosphere and graphics are really good for the first few moments, until you meet the alien and the ""game"" just makes you feel frustrated and annoyed.

The aliens' nest was the best part. Shame it was near the end of the game... Guess how long it took? About 15-30 minutes! Yay!

Why am I sarcastically celebrating? Because this ""game"" never ends!, and when it finally ends, its sooo underwhelming.

Not worth playing. Unless you're an Alien superfan, but even then that's a stretch. If you DO decide to play this, don't explore at all, unless you're a completionist, but be warned, you'll be so sick of it before you've reached the middle part of the game. There's NOTHING to find. Also, once you get the movement sensor, use it all the time, because it shows the exact path you should take to the next objective. If it doesn't show anything, it's because you're close enough, or haven't triggered a voice line yet. Believe me, you'll thank me later.

Actually, start with the DLC. It plays just like the best parts of the game and it's really short.

Overrated junk, as usual. At least it's better than Outlast."
272,1,0.382,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","So got to a point in the game where I was constantly killed.  Sometimes only a few seconds after the save, and once well beyond the save to a point I'd never been before (or since!). I've been killed so many times I've lost track.  I've read through guides for help on tactics and such and still can't survive using their tactics or advice.  Have lost all interest in playing the game now and have no desire to start over. In spite of this, graphics are fantastic for such an older game and the atmosphere is faithful to the movie.  It's just that the entire game is a scavenger hunt while you're playing hide and seek, and you don't get to play the seek part."
273,1,0.3925,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Alien isolation, the game where nothing works. Apart from mood.

Reading the other reviews I don't know if we've even played the same game.

Of course the positives that everyone can agree on, are the fatefullness to the franchise and the mood. No other alien game has captivated the mood of the movies so well. The locations look good, the characters are pretty believeable and the alien looks as good as ever. That's where the positives end.

Then there are the negatives:

Controls: 

Apparently this is a bad console port because looking around with mouse has a terrible delay and it seems that there is some mouse acceleration happening when you rotate at a direction. It gives the feeling that the main character was drunk or on some sedatives all the time. I don't know how ppl can control the game accurately with this. 

Also running always seems to trigger the alien... Apart from the scripted scenes when you have to run... but in this one scene dont run under any vent because in this part the alien doesn't hear you running but he is in every vent simultaneously and will grab you if you run under any of them.

Sneaking is good idea. Unless it isn't. Some scenes are scripted so that sneaking does no good and the human enemies see you from a far and shoot you on sight so there's no sneaking aroud them. Luckily they are idiots, so you can go to a room behind a door and bang the wrench so they come in the room and you can hit them in the head with  the wrench one after another. They don't mind that their friends lay in a pile on the floor at the exact spot they are walking into. Talk about immersion.

In addition of controls feeling laggy the key settings are most counter-intuitive. Exit buttons especially. You enter the options menu with esc and also return back to game with esc. That's a given. So when you open an inventory, you also exit with esc? No. There is 'Q' that exits the gadgets and computers but doesn't exit the map. No The map is exited with the TAB-key it is also entered with. When the alien is coming and you are on a computer or a gadget, the challenge is to find the key to get off the computer before it sees you. Also browsing the computers feel clunky, the buttons to go in and out folders and activating them are just weird.

For some reason the items work so that you have to hold the right button to wield the item and then press left to use it... unless you want to use the wrench in which case it doesn't matter what item you are wielding, you still activate the wrench with the left button.

These controls can be changed, but only partially and some buttons are hardcoded so that you cannot bind them at all.
Different switches and wrenches and handles also open a hint for unintuitive key combinations to use them, which are not bindable or even inspectable (to my knowledge) anywhere when not performing the said action.

Talking about the 'Q' key that exits stuff, it is also used to open the radial menu if you hold it. Handy... The radial menu is also strange. With one mouse button (don't remember which one) you choose an item and with the other you craft it. The crafting menu is sometimes bugged so when you try to press the buttons with mouse, nothing happens, but when you press somewhere around near the button in the crafting menu, it triggers the action.

Items and weapons:

Ok, so the controls suck. But at least the items and weapons work? Well. Not particularly.

Scanner? I'm not sure, but I think the scanner beeping actually attracts the alien. Correct me if I'm wrong. But if I'm right, using the scanner is kinda bad, so you'd rather just listen and look around where the alien moves.

Medi-kits? Well, they replinish your health but encounter with the alien is pretty much instakill and let's be honest. Even the full health bar doesn't help for many seconds either against humans or androids. 

There is an electric rod that feels to be just the thing you stick into an android to disable it? Well, it doesn't even hit him. It's like you were prodding thin air. It's also no good for the alien.
Firing weapons kill people and anrdoids ok, but because the drunk controls I mentioned earlier, you cannot hit a thing. Also one would think that the alien would recoil from a bullet, and maybe even go around you to attack you from a different angle. But no. He doesn't seem to care at all if you shoot him. He just comes and eats you as always.

Molotov coctails? I'm gonna tell you a story: Came out of elevator, saw a group of hostile survivors nicely grouped up so I threw a molotov coctail at them. It was super effective! Everyone burst in flames and died. Immediately the alien dropped down from the vent in the middle of the flame explosion without caring about the fire and runned to kill me. Tried to do this couple of times even throwing another molotov to the alien, but it still just ran to me and slaughtered me. Useful item.

Flamethrower? This is actually useful and I've got no bad thing to say about it. This must be the exception that confirms the rule.

I havent got around to using smoke bomb or pipe bomb or emp mine. Noise maker seems to attract the alien well enough but the player seems to attract it better so at least I have only been able to bring the alien to me with it.


Stealth:

So if the items are mostly no good then there is hiding. Ducts are good news. Maybe even too good. At least the difficulty levels I've tried, the alien never came to a duct of heard me crawling, so they equal invisibility/invincibility.

The closets are no good. Why are there even those things when the alien seems almost always to check the closet when you hide in it. Also there is button combination to hold breath in the closet but I'm not sure it does anything else than build tension.

So the game is mostly sneaking around hoping the alien does not come your way - because sure as heck it does not come to any npc's way even if they made noise. Other than scripted kills, it might attack an npc if it's on it's way when it is pathfinding to you.

Final thoughts:

All in all I've tried to force myself to play this piece of garbage in small portions with weeks long breaks because ppl tell me there is a point where it gets good.

Fat. Chance. But I'll at least try to finish it so I can't be told ""don't judge it when you haven't even played it through"""

You cannot sneak past the alien.

Anyone who pretends the monster isn't total garbage is just not paying attention I'm afraid. Space Marines kill it with far less lethal methods in the lore alone, yet a single Xeno can take shotguns, revolvers, flame throwers, and instagib you even if you shoot it in the head, which again, lorewise would would INJURE IT SEVERELY AND MAKE IT RUN AWAY, but no no, let's inflate the difficulty by pretending it's an unkillable being of impossible preportions with clairvoyant abilities.

Aged like a decade old cheese: Stinks like hell, has no taste, and needs to be thrown away in the garbage. An absolute disgrace to the Alien franchise. The mobile game that came after was 10 times better.

Oh the speedrunners can be it in less than 6 hours? Don't care, didn't ask. If you are speedrunning, you literally studied the wiki, and every single mechanic of the video game, and every single location of every single item with every animation memorized down to the frame. It is such a lame excuse that people try to cope with, by using a third-party who literally studies the core mechanics like a religion as some sort of hard fact that 'if they can you can'.

This game is completely unfair, completely artificial, and nothing about it is possible. If I left the comments on, so many people would embarrass themselves by claiming that you're just not moving quietly enough (crouched all the time), you don't even need craftables (k so don't ever use a noisemaker lmao), how you to be careful fast (this is called an oxymoron and it cancels one another out), and that you just aren't playing it right (but they never tell you how hahaha.)

The rest of the game is opening doors by doing captcha like puzzles that are all the same. The sound effects and music are good but the gameplay is tedious and repetitive.

I was excited to dig into a game which I read by first-hand anecdotes from players as well as reviews from gaming news sites described as if the xenomorph was its own player that had such advanced AI that it was almost as if it was playing the game with you, with its goal being to kill you. Perhaps it was my fault for getting so hyped up, but this game made me yawn and gave me headaches more than it did startle me.

Pros:

- Gorgeous graphics
- Accessible UI with easy to adjust settings
- Stays true to the aesthetic of the original movie while allowing liberty of modernization through both environment and unlockable additional story content throughout the game via audio tapes and computer entries from previous workers on the station
- Beautiful soundtrack and audio design, perfectly timed fade ins and cut offs during cutscenes

Cons:

- Predictable AI that loses its fear-inducing quality fast as you progress. Once you get the basic mechanics down (avoid drool spots, don't go to the same hiding place twice, crouch and don't run), the game slows to an agonizing crawl as you're forced to repeat the same mechanics (replaces fuses, find the hidden item, flip switches, etc) over and over, all while the xenomorph seems to be nowhere to be found because once you get good at predicting how the AI works, the entire game is ruined. The only way you can get jumped is if you intentionally run, make loud noise, or otherwise purposefully trigger it.
- Jumpscares are repetitive, boring, and predictable. The jumpscares might actually land if you couldn't tell you were about to be jumped. Even if you can't hear or see the xenomorph behind you, as soon as you can't move and are stuck in a cutscene for a couple of seconds and can hear the ""thud thud thud"" of it running towards you, you're already ready for one of the three or four scenes you've already seen. Jumpscares are meant to be sudden. Even a second of a flash of an image can get you if it's timed right. I can think of dozens of indie games that have scared me far, far more than this big-name, highly acclaimed game has.
- Less of a survival horror as it is a puzzle/strategy game. When I think of survival horror I think of either very isolated one-on-one (or one-on-few) games (Dead Space and Resident Evil: Biohazard come to mind), or the typical ""survive X amount of time against X amount of things""/""reach X goal before X thing gets you"" (FNAF series, classic Resident Evil, etc.)
- The other enemies detract from the immersion. Frankly, this game would have been so, SO much scarier if it was literally just you on the station that has been infested by xenomorph (or even just the one!), but when I first played and met the first human I was deeply disappointed. I had gone in with the mindset this would be a heartracing, fast-paced survival trying to outrun the xenomorph and get in contact with my mothership. However, the presence of other people makes this feel more like Fallout/Bioshock/Borderlands in which your main objective is randomly interrupted by combat that does nothing to add to the story and only really wastes time (and ammo!)
- Extremely, and I mean EXTREMELY slow paced. As I said before, you are quite literally crawling through this massive ship doing the same thing over and over again. The first time you have to hide from androids it's anxiety inducing, but after the fourth time you're really just ready to blast them with the flamethrower and mow through them. (Which you CAN, because you never see the damn monster you're supposed to use the flamethrower on.)

Didn't finish it (got very close, I think I was on the second to last chapter), don't have plans too. Maybe I'll get drunk with some friends and play it on the hardest difficulty because the only way this game could be a real challenge or could actually be scary is if you're seeing double and have a bunch of drunk idiots screaming behind you. I bought the DLC as well (again, huge Alien franchise fan so I was really expecting a lot considering the reviews!), don't plan on playing it. This game just left a bad taste in my mouth and after nearly a full 24-hour day playing it, I can assure you from one horror fan to another this is one you'll want to skip. Over-hyped, not worth it (bought it during the summer sale thank goodness), and all it will do is drain you mentally and physically as you keep waiting for the one jumpscare that will get you but never comes.

What really got me was that after playing this for six or so hours getting frustrated at the lack of real substance or progression, I loaded up Fallout 4 to play and unwind. A fucking mudcrab jumping out of the sand at the same time I was running past scared me more than 22 hours of this piece of shit game did. If you love horror, this isn't for you. If you're an idiot, maybe it is. Don't waste your money, or more importantly your time on this game. Good graphics can't beat a good scare."

[*]Flashlight battery duration: I understand it must be short for the ""scaryness"", but they are pushing it too much.
[*]No jumping, makes a bit silly that you can't walk/jump over a small object like a suitcase when the alien is chasing you, so you get stuck on it.
[*]Inconsistencies: Enemies can't hear you when you slam the locker door to hide, noisily drag your feet when sneaking, or loudly open doors, yet they hear you if you just walk slowly.

[*]Bloom effect from all the blinking lights is blinding you so you can't see what's right in front of you, while it has no effect on the enemies' vision (No option to turn bloom off).
[*]Starting over the same area 15 times because there are 6 people in a tiny area covering the whole area camping at the entrance is not fun. I'm a fan of stealth games but after 2 hours and zero progress, starting over and needing to go back where you were 15 min ago at crawl speed every time, I really started to feel like uninstalling. If there were manual saves it would help but I'm not a kid anymore with plenty of time to start over and over. Got a job, a family and other priorities so I don't want to spend 2 hours re-doing the same level. This is not fun.
[*]A human NPC opened a door and I could not get in while sneaking because there was invisible wall. What the hell???
[*]Often there are no places to hide in an area with a single entrance and exit, you got to walk in plain view and stick to the corners where they see you anyways.
[*]Humans have the same night vision as the alien. They see you across the room while you are standing still in the dark, while you can't even see them. Had to boost the gamma to the maximum to see them, set difficulty to Novice, still ended up rage quitting
[*]Supposed to be a scary game but it's mostly a ""raging against hobos with guns"" game, did not even get to the part where you have to hide from the alien, the part to find data cell was enough to make me uninstall.

300,3,0.3795,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I was incredibly excited to play this game- I was looking forward to getting scared and enjoying a good time on stream with my chat.

Unfortunately this game is so poorly ported to PC that I've had to deal with various glitches, poor lighting guides, rigged death sequences, and multiple crashes upon death.

While in some aspects these have been very funny, majority of the time it's frazzling or downright aggravating. I just wanted to play a fun spooky game, not spend over 4 hours in one sequence ""just trying to get through this part."" That ruins the entire goal of being immersed, and the devs who left it as such should entirely be ashamed.

Yes it's very difficult to make a game, yes this game is a few years old. I cannot ever judge a game dev for making a game because I don't think I could ever do so. But I paid very good money to Finally play this game, on the goal of being spooked and startled, and all I've had was a comparison to Dark Souls in level of head bashing my head against the wall because it keeps crashing or Xenomommy / Daddymorph keeps killing me after it LEAVES THE ROOM.

Not to mention, I've gotten lost for HOURS because the game straight up never tells you any of the controls! I learned that I could lean back in the locker AFTER I DIED. It gives you 0.00000001 second to read the instructions before killing you. Same with holding your breath.

I didn't even know I had a MAP until I was a good SIX HOURS into the game. And my chat had to tell me. The game never mentions it.

The goals are only mentioned once on screen, so I had to spend a very long time trying to remember what I was doing because I didn't know the map existed and it had your goal on there. It's utterly ridiculous.

I cannot in good conscious suggest anyone play this unless you're willing to put up with the problems I've mentioned above. I keep playing it because I want to finish it and not feel like I wasted my money, but at the same time, it all ready feels like I have for a product this unpolished. I just want a dang horror game that works, damn it. :("

306,3,0.4796,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I really, really, really want to give this game a good review...but, I ...just...can't.  

I want to, though.  It has good parts.  First off, the captured the atmosphere of a 1970s sci-fi movie perfect.  The art was great.  The atmosphere was great.  There are plenty of amazing moments.

But at the end of the day, overall, it just wasn't fun.  

For one thing, as many others have said, this game overstays its welcome by a lot.  For this to make sense, you have to understand how absolutely and repetitively tedious many of the tasks are.  

There are two types of enemies in this game...everyone else...who you can mostly kill one way or the other...and the Alien, who you can't.  He's immortal, and he one shots you, which isn't bad, really, but it gets overused to the point where it's just boring and tedious, and for the last 3rd of the game, I was basically hate-playing it.  

This all has to do with the AI, which they were real proud of.  There's a director that controls where the alien is.  The director knows where you are, of course.  The director has two modes.  Either he has the alien nearby you, crawling around in the vents, and it won't bother you unless you get its attention.  Or, the director tells the alien to be constantly right up your butt.  (The third parts of the game don't really involve the alien and are really just filler because you have tools to kill everything for the most part).  OK, so, when the alien is told to be right on top of you, the director sends him to the room you are in.  Then, after a while, tells him to disappear.  Then, typically, tells him to reappear again pretty soon after.  

Here's is where the design functionality breaks.  This is also a story game where you are supposed to, like, read e-mails and listen to audio logs and stuff.  But, in many parts of the game, you just, can't.  You are doing everything in your power just to avoid it's absolutely relentless search for you, and if you stop to read and e-mail, you're going to die.  Most games tend to put something in there so that players can enjoy the plot uninterrupted.  They should have put all the plot parts in the non-alien parts where you can kill everything and search and read and listen in peace.  Every other game does.  By the way, this game doesn't even make the save locations safe!  (Oh, yeah, you can only have one save slot at a time!  Good luck with that!)  

So, the above design breakage is pretty unforgivable.  If you have this relentless search AI in certain parts of the game, that's great.  But, don't overdo it to the point of boredom, and don't let it interfere with your other design elements.  Just think about how the player is experiencing the content for a minute, and you'll see why this is a bad idea.  

Also, the Alien's constant obsession with you and awareness of your basic location, as provided by the director, eventually becomes more humorous than scary.  Also, why I'm here, why do the aliens kill everyone except for androids but not bother to eat them?  If it were a bio-weapon designed to kill and kill, it would kill androids.  If it was killing for a reason like hunger, then it would eat people.  But, they never do.  They're huge and use lots of energy, and they don't need to eat.  The only possible explanation is that this is this way because the script says it is this way.  Or, in other words, bad writing...but, I digress.  (Remember in the movie, you didn't ask this question, because you rarely saw the thing.  It was horror...not sci fi.  And, in horror, such strange inconsistencies are forgiven.  Face huggers hug faces because the idea of having that thing on your face is scary.  That's why!  Get it?  Anyways....

There are bugs.  Some are funny, like the time when I'm under a table, and an android is kicking me while I am shooting him with a shotgun.  The alien comes in and patiently waits his turn behind the android.  Like a true gentlemen.  

Some aren't that funny!  I slammed an elevator door on an android once, and the elevator was moving for about five seconds, and the android walks right through the door.  There are open vent shafts that disallow movement through them randomly.  There are a lot of clipping and non-clipping issues generally, probably more than I've seen in a AAA game in a very long time.  I'm shocked that QA didn't find them and more shocked that they're still there over a decade later.  

Anyways, I wanted to like this game.  Some parts were super cool.  The story was good, even though I stopped caring long before the game ended.  The first few hours were fantastic.  

Overall, good effort, but this ones a miss.  Buy it on sale.  They say there is a mod that disallows the director from knowing your location.  I'd highly recommend using that so that you can actually read the story elements that are available.  I think I found, maybe half of them.  The other half of the time, I was hiding in a locker."
307,3,0.4872,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","[EDIT] - Some times, when life's getting me down, I like to come back to this review to cheer myself up.  There's so many brilliant ways in which strangers try to tell me my opinion, what I have, is in fact - wrong. Remember children, it's okay to be different and not to like something. I also don't like pizza, reasons for this may include me not understanding the pizza, the pizza being too intimidating, not being a real food lover, me not finishing a pizza so being able to express an opinion on pizza - I've not yet worked it out. I'm off to leave a review at Dominos, see what happens. [EDIT] 

First off - this is a brilliant game.  I'd go so far as to say iconic. There are elements in this game which are genuinely as frightening as you would expect from a big budget horror film.  But it's just not for me, I could not recommend it, and for my own preferences in gameplay, this is why.

I'm halfway through the campaign as I write this, I started by being excited by it and eager to experience it's legendary atmosphere, I had a massive smile on my face of terror, which was clearly an attempt to calm myself, it was a slow burn to get into but the controls and story tuition eased me in, it built really nicely up to the unveiling of the xenomorph, and that moment was fantastic - but then what followed were session after session on the computer just hiding from things.  I have nothing against 'hide and seek' but after how ever many hours its taken me to get half way through, I checked online and I was smack bang in the middle of the campaign, I have a flamethrower, I have a lot of gadgets I can make, asking myself ""do I want to spend the same amount of time slowly crawling from one filing cabinet to the next?"" - sadly I don't.

If I could simply summarise the negative.  I found the lack of variation to the game play prevented me from being incentivised to go back to the game to finish the other missions, which by all accounts don't vary in location, style, threat, improved equipment, to any significant degree.

The last negative review I left was met with comments that sounded like I really hurt some peoples feelings - I hope that's not the case here, please don't take it personally.  I am clearly in the minority here as there are a huge amount of positive things to say about this game.  The atmosphere, the entry into the Alien mythology, the way in which the game has a really ""grown up"" premise that doesn't rely on macho gun crap, the well documented AI of the Alien creature - there is so much to love.

But sadly for me, a massive Alien (C) fan, it didn't keep my attention enough.

You might have more luck than me."

First off atmosphere, it is amazing. It really immersed me into the game, the sounds and environments really add to this too and they are by far the best part of the game.
The graphics also still hold up to this day in my opinion, the game still looks really good, especially the Alien however...

This game overstays its welcome for waaaay too long, the last 8-10 hours are awful and the entire time I was just nothing but mad and annoyed, because of many things biggest offenders being: Your Arsenal, mainly the flamethrower literally removes all tension from the game when you can just blast the Alien away as soon as you see it. The pacing is pretty bad too because it goes from slow tension filled  build up in the first half of the game to FUCKING RAMBO, *EXPLOSIONS* *GUNSHOTS*  ALIENS EVERYWHERE GOTTA FIGHT EM ALL OFF!
Yeah as you could probably guess the last half of the game is mainly where my a lot of hate comes from.

Overall I give the game a 4/10, Looks really good and immerses you in the first half/4 hours of the game, but after that it just overstays its welcome by prolonging the game for no bloody reason"

Game is too repetitive,  Lost interest after first the coolness wore off after few missions because of frustration, slowness, and lack of anything new.  Game play is either super slow or super fast, nothing in between.  While this can be good for adding tension, not great for casual play on easy mode.  Move, wait, repeat.  Controls are clunky when it comes to interacting with some things and slow to respond to some commands.  

Seems like it would be a fun world to just explore, but there really is no option for that after the first mission.  Then it is a matter of just trying to get through a mission and then how much time you want to waste reloading and trying to get to different parts.

Steam deck specific review - a lot of text in the game is far too small to read on the screen.  I wear bifocals and can't read anything on the map unless I take my glasses off and hold the screen about 6 inches from my eyes. 

I really want to like this game, but in the end it is not fun to play after the novelty wears off.  I get no sense of accomplishment or reward when playing."

Otherwise the skill checks go right past you and explode before you were given any chance to hit said skill checks.

QTE worked fine when the game console designers remembered to adjust for screen delay on TVs for console play, but not fixing it for PC and faster monitors than TV make this just as bad if not worse. BUT if you have a gaming monitor with less than 1ms response time [delay lag between PC and Monitor], MAYBE this game could work near to what it was supposed to play at. I assume that Steam does not adjust delay lag due to monitor response time, and game companies do not have veteran devs to fix this common issue, which they need to do.

I bought this on sale for $1-3 dollars, during alien week or something silly. I think the entire DLC and game came out to around $8. At that time I would have said to avoid this game due to being unplayable with QTE."

The game shouldn't have been 18 or something missions, it should have been 12 or 14. Several bits could have been cut out to vastly improve the late-game pacing.

[spoiler] For example, why bother going to the APOLLO core? The area was cool, but I did all that work for something that essentially could have been an email on a computer, or a voice recording?

I mean this is not your usual stealth game deal, the game is trying to fuck with you non stop. it gives you the illusion of stealth but the truth is you will die constantly in the cheapest way. Before i quit wrote this review I died crouching out of a room where the alien was nowhere near because the game decided it would just insta kill because i walked under a vent.
BEARING IN MIND I HAD BEEN SNEAKING AROUND UNSEEN FOR 10 PLUS MINS
SO THERE WAS NO WAY IN HELL HE KNEW WHERE I WAS.

I'd chalk it up to a bug or something if it happened once
but it happens constantly.
Also some of the areas you have to ""sneak"" through are literally just 2 ft wide corridors and empty rooms
so the smart idea would be to wait the alien out
hide somewhere and wait til he goes somewhere else
BUT HERES THE THING
he wont
infact if you wait around long enough, you will fucking die instantly. Regardless of how well hidden or where you are.
Honestly the best way to play this game is to cheese the AI
because you can't fight the motherfucker or run from him
And the stealth is honestly SUPRISINGLY DOGSHIT

For the first idk
couple hours
it has amazing atmosphere, you can feel the decay and terror.
but that all becomes trivialised because you're constantly thinking 
OH FUCK OH FUCK I HOPE THE SUSSY XENO GUY DOESN'T PENETRATE ME WITH HIS TAIL AND FORCE ME TO REPLAY THE LAST 20 FUCKING MINS OF CROUCH WALKING THROUGH 2 FOOT CORRIDORS WHILE I HOPE THE GAME DOESNT JUST RANDOMLY SPAWN THE ALIEN IN FRONT OF ME (YES THIS CAN HAPPEN)

AND DONT EVEN GET ME FUCKING STARTED ON LOCKERS
THEY. ARE. A. JOKE.
HIDING IN A LOCKER FOR 5 MINS IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEAD BY DAYLIGHT
BECAUSE THREE AFK CROWS ACTUALLY GIVE YOU AWAY LESS THAN YOUR PHYSICAL PRESENCE INSIDE A LOCKER IN THIS GAME

don't believe me?
Look at the guides
They all say to stay away from lockers
entering a locker is the equivalent firing a gun off and screaming COME AND FUCKING GET ME
Leaving a locker, Amanda fucking kicks the door open and long jumps into the centre of the room.

Do you want a crying in fear (not out of being jumpscared, but out of having your time wasted and losing progress) whilst crawling around at the speed a baby moves only to die anyway because this whole game is RNG simulator 2069
well 
Get this game!

The gameplay is identical to every other generic survival horror game. Learn the monster's pattern, sneak past it, monster's pattern changes, repeat. It soon becomes more annoying than scary.

The story was a fun, albeit generic, horror movie plot.

I enjoyed the game for a while, the alien starts off as a rare threat so it's exciting when it appears. I enjoyed crafting items to deal with different threats. I also enjoyed the collectathon aspect. But by the 6th mission I was tired of hiding in a locker to study the alien's pattern, sneaking past it and then having to do the exact same thing every other area of the mission. Maybe the game gets way better, I don't know. But by the sixth mission I was not having fun."

This game has a plethora of context sensitive controls, prompts, and QTEs that are difficult to remember because you only use half of them 1/4 of the time.  It also doesn't do anything to convey why they're important or useful.  Conveyance is a massive issue with this game.  This game is extremely linear, why I am I so confused trying to get around?

Finally, the stealth/combat is absolute trash.  Enemies are dumb as a rock and far more annoying than frightening.  The only stress and anxiety I had playing this survival-horror game was the frustration of figuring out system hacking mini-games the game hadn't told me about earlier.

I am baffled at how highly regarded this game is.  It has a massive following that I don't think it deserves.  The gameplay is trash.  The story doesn't matter, and it's an eyesore to look at.

In the end you have an unkillable alien, a few cheap deaths which necessitate replaying the same parts of the game because of the limited save system.

* Has to run at 60fps for input to work correctly (if you do run at 144fps you will have issues)
* Deadzones when using the mouse (wtf?) this a pc game not a console game, remove the damn deadzones!!!

And some issues with specific game design, one very key one being that the alien is very predictable in its pattern. If you are in one area it will always stay VERY close to where you are, not leaving a like 50m radius of the player, this is a fundamentally bad design as it ruins immersion since I know exactly where it is going to be at all times.

For me, the game is 8/10, however the PC port issues bring it down to a 4/10 as it is borderline unplayable with the deadzone/60fps being enforced.

If you have a controller that you can use on PC, use that, as trying to use KB/M on this game genuinely feels like getting a lobotomy.

Shame on me for not knowing this going into it but I guess I expected a better storyline and more action.  As it is, I think its kind of boring.  The messages on the terminals spread throughout the game don't contribute much to the story (insofar as I've played it) and the story itself is not very memorable to say the least.  The music is melodramatic in its attempts to be reminiscent of the movies and most of the game just feels kind of a like a headnod to the original movies as well rather than having anything unique or original to contribute.  The graphics are pretty cool, you can tell the designers put a lot of work into the environments but that is pretty much the only thing I like about this game.

Back in 2018 I got the game, picked hardest difficulty and breezed through to mission 5 (you need to go through a medical ward where you meet this new NPC doctor)

Upon getting the codes to open a door the area goes into quarantine and the Alien comes out of the vent.

The Alien, all the way back then, would start screeching when it entered from the vent and finished the animation. Then it would randomly dart off somewhere and out of motion range.

Still sneaking I would make my way to the door, cover to cover and ensuring it was no where near when I entered the code.

Either right after entering the code (when it is not even on my pinger) or immediately after exiting cover from its entrance and had darted off (where it was out of ping range) I would suddenly get killed from behind (which is amusing as I hide under a bed next to a wall, meaning the Alien has to be in the wall to get behind me).

The kicker? 
Here I am four years later, 2022.
There is no where else to hide on this scripted entrance. I tried planting a flare before grabbing the codes. A good way aways from the bed I am hiding under, the Alien would go over to look at the flare, the second I move it would TELEPORT back in-front of me and kill me.

So, I try a new save after deleting my cloud save. Get all the way back to the EXACT same spot on the same difficulty in Mission 5.

The exact same stuff.

So this tells me two things. Either the devs want us to find a way to cheat as they made a nearly impossible scripted part to pass. Or they just do not care about their game.

A quick Google search tells me I am not the only one with this issue too.

I may try it on a lower difficulty so I can beat the game after four years, but I cannot in good conscience recommend a game with a scripted auto-failure feature on the hardest difficulty which cannot be bypassed without cheating it somehow."

355,2,0.341,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","In space, no one can hear you scream in frustration.

This game reminded me of: Bioshock and Phantaruk (and not usually in a good way) and the movie THX 1138 (in a good way). And the movie Alien of course.

In its default/official and unmodified state (as it was originally installed by me including the official game and its official DLC content), I rate Alien Isolation 2/5. A good idea executed poorly. The way this game has been designed, the Alien’s AI effectively ruins the whole gameplay experience (at least once you get to the point in the game where the Alien starts hunting you). 

EDIT: But I should mention that stealth games are really not my thing and I get bored hiding in lockers and staying completely still for several minutes at a time waiting for the alien to go away.

The alien’s supposedly dynamic hunting behavior gets incredibly repetitive and frustrating, causing the player to die over and over again as the alien hunts down and kills you. The alien can often find you no matter what you do and if you hide, the alien will not usually leave your vicinity anyhow, killing you the moment you finally come out of hiding 

EDIT: (but it has been said that this is totally untrue and has not been everyone's experience, see comments to this review)

Contrary to what has been canonically established in all other Alien games and the movie Aliens, it is also impossible to harm the alien. Shooting it only makes it angry such that it immediately kills you with such speed that you cannot get away. In the movie Aliens, Corporal Hicks kills one at close range with a shotgun. I shot one with a pistol (it looks like a high-powered Rhino pistol which should be more than adequate) and I died anyhow. I fired 2 shots into its head, 2 into its neck and 2 into its chest and though the game showed the shots hitting, the alien wasn’t damaged anyhow).This game gives you powerful guns and lets you fire them at the alien but the alien is invincible anyhow and this situation makes no sense.

Until you can acquire a flamethrower (later in the game) which will frighten the alien away temporarily, you must rely on various items which provide temporary distractions, blind luck and gross repetition-

EDIT: (or perhaps use more patience than I had while playing this game) 

-to survive to the next place where the game will let you save your file before moving on the the next frustrating segment. As in the survival-horror game Phantaruk, dying is scary at first but soon becomes repetitious, frustrating and boring. 

EDIT: (But maybe I should have been more patient while hiding in lockers and such while the Alien was nearby).

The act of dying and reloading your game from previous save points over and over again also completely breaks the game’s sense of immersion; no longer are you in the story trying to figure out what you can do. Instead you are merely playing a game trying to figure out what the game designers want you to do so you can get to the next place where you can save your game again. Maybe I should just give up and go play Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy instead? Oddly, this awful situation is made even more frustrating by the fact that there’s so much else that is fantastically good including incredible sound and great graphics.

But what if this game effectively had no alien? At least not one which actively tries to hunt you throughout the course of the game? There are still other hazards to avoid and dangers to face along with a detailed plot. What if the alien almost only ever appeared during scripted events which were necessary for the story to be told?

Soon after beginning this game (before getting the flamethrower) I felt stuck and was very close to giving up on this game altogether. So I went online to see what I could do and I found this discussion thread:

https://steamcommunity.com/app/214490/discussions/0/620695877286051362/

Alien successfully removed from game

“After a few hours trying I finally found a way to remove the Alien from the game for those players who wants to free explore the Sevastopol without the constant threat of the xenomorph.
The way to do that is making a little mod on the file ALIEN.BML that the game uses to set the alien attributes.
At the end of the file there is a line that sets the alien behaviour with ""alien_behave"" and I replace it with ""NoBehaviour"" so the alien still is there in some vent but doesn't make anything. It is freezed.

For those who want to edit that .bml file must be with an hex editor. I recommend to backup the whole folder before making any changes.
There's a link to download the modified .bml file https://www.dropbox.com/s/zfl7obl54wp8e2a/ALIEN.BML?dl=0

First of all rename the original ALIEN.BML in Steam\SteamApps\common\Alien Isolation\DATA\CHR_INFO\ATTRIBUTES\ to ALIEN_BACKUP.BML or something like that, then paste the downloaded file in that folder.

And thats all! Notice that humans or androids still can kill you! Be careful!

Thank you, thank you, thank you Lebowski of Spain! 

(I always scan files carefully for viruses and stuff after downloading (but before using) and I’m careful about using links I find anywhere. I certainly wouldn’t recommend clicking on any links inside Steam (including reviews like this one). I copy and pasted this guy’s link into google’s search and tried to find out what I could about it before actually going there. Be careful out there. The Internet (even Steam) is like Gotham city without Batman. Sure, there’s cool stuff (art museums, libraries, theaters, etc.) but try not to get kidnapped and held for ransom, mugged, etc.).

Anyhow, this fix doesn’t exactly remove the Alien. It provides a modified AI game file to replace an existing file so that any hunting Alien which appears will effectively have NO AI. This just freezes the Alien in place so it won’t move or attack no matter what. Almost always this means that the Alien winds up stuck in some unseen (and never meant to be seen) air vent in the ceiling, remaining out of sight except for a few rare situations where it will stand in the middle of a hallway or in a room. 

Scripted events which involve the Alien will still occur and be animated as normal. All other game entities will remain unaffected. You can play without the frustration of dying over and over again (but you still have to overcome the numerous other hazards this game throws at you). Parts of the game do become similar to a walking simulator (a walking simulator with occasional obstacles) though some enemies remain but at least they don’t represent a totally insurmountable, frustrating and perhaps buggy challenge (at least not on the easiest difficulty).

With this modification I can rate [strike] Alien [/strike] Isolation 4/5. Good. But I cannot generally recommend the game as it exists on Steam. This fix (or something like it) should have been originally included by the game designers as an optional experience.

It doesn't give the foreboding ambiance of the Aliens movies. Silly green screen monitors give a bad 1980s vibe, they don't have any nostalgic feeling. Character models are superior to previous Aliens games but other than that everything looks so average so bland. Environment always feels like a simple lab simulation of a space ship. Character movements slowness and aimlessness of the character doesn't give you any motivation.

You don`t fight the Alien, You fight mechanics.
Environments and art were wasted for that kind of a gameplay. 

Spoiler! One part of the game always ends in Your failure - where`s the Games concept and User-influence in it?
Developer wanted to make an interactive experience from a linear movie and programmed everything for the User, leaving attraction of going from A to B.

Cinematics are very poor (camera, light, editing) and missed the film mood and style.
Game developers often think they can ""direct"" - no, They can`t. Too much camera movement (!), no pace, chaotic editing, lack of understanding of the lightning ""on set"". Even huge projects like this one have poor cinematics because of this. Hire professionals. 

And mechanics. There are those magical moments when You escape and try to aim properly to find ""E to Open"" on the airlock - it won`t work if You are to close, You have to back up a little and aim carefuly, then animation of airlock opening and all that with the Alien breathing on Your neck... You know what I mean.

It looks very good, sound reflects the film but I was bored by poor narration, cinematics and mechanics and lack of understanding of the Alien films. And it comes from a hard core original trilogy fan. I don`t count that French-Alien incident.

And it's beautiful too, I notice attention to small graphics details in this game, that's very cool. But still, playing 20+ hours of this game feeling mostly frustration is just not worth it."
370,3,0.4689,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Wow this game really blew my expectations out of the water! At first, I thought that when I played American Walking Simulator 2016, it couldn't possibly get better than it. I was definitely proven wrong. Not only do I get the privilege of walking around for the first 20 minutes of the game doing absolutely nothing while shitty ambient noise plays, but I also get to PAY 60 dollars to do it! Its like the Funky Pop (Cuckold Simulator reference FYI) of the video game world! I tip my fedora to you, SEGA. You've truly exceeded my standards and have changed my view on this world. My only complaint is that since I'm really strong in real life (like I could lift probably 20 guys on a bench) the alien isn't all that scary to me. If I were on the ship, I could probably kick his ass easily. He's what? Like 5'10? Well I'm 6'8"" and I would snap that twig POS in two easy peasy. Another complaint I have about this masterpiece is how the main character is a woman and she's really stupid and weak. I don't care about her or her stupid ugly pug-faced mother. She's also not hot so how in the world could I feel related in any way, or to be in the shoes of, to this character? I remember back when I was a boy, games like these would have never been made. Games used to be so much better. You ever heard of Free Realms? Those were the days. I remember back when that funny little orange charicature would hop out on the screen on the television and tell me to play that damned MMO game. It was probably my sexual awakening when I was younger but its okay because it molded me into the person I am now. Compared to good games like Big Rigs, Free Realms, or Pirate101, this game really gets outshined by the g(old)ies. The alien kind of reminds me of Ghostfreak from Ben 10: Alien Force but not in a bad way. Ghostfreak had a lot to do with my sexual upbringing as a child as well as several sex scenes as described in many of Stephen King's novels. (i.e. Imagining women turning their heads completely upside down and outstretching their jaw but in a sexual way). If we want to delve into the realm (free realms reference!) of newer games, I'd say Fortnite is probably better than this. In my opinion, it represents the main antagonist and protagonist of this franchise far better than any triple AAA title could do. 


TLDR: Game sucks, its boring, not even that scary if you're not a total whiny coward, and a walkfest. I could put on a pedometer and walk around for an entire week and still not have as many steps as I took in this game in 20 minutes. That's how much walking there is."

373,3,0.3533,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Played through the game in 29 hours on Hard mode and looking back, overall I did NOT enjoy this game. 

This game has a very unforgiving save system, you constantly have to keep in mind where the closest save point is, you constantly have to move back and forth between save points just to be on the safe side and for good reason.

Vague directions and guides. I was forced to look up walkthroughs on so many occasions it's actually not even funny. I got stuck on so many rooms just wondering where to go next and the 'spacebar' tracker even though the game tells you it's a lifesaver never truly gave me that much information on where to go since there's a map you know, and the tool never gave me enough help on the whereabouts of the creature and the bots, since the bots and the creature always know where you are in contrast to the humans and they will ALWAYS pop up anyway, so the general 'guide' i truly had was to just crouch-walk to my destinations everywhere.

Yeah, the AI mechanic is trash. The AI in this game makes no sense from a logical perspective, why is the creature ONLY interested in you and not the other people on the ship? Why does it seem to want to follow through the entire ship only after you. Why do the people suddenly turn into packs of hunter groups that shoot all humans on sight, what's up with that? It makes no sense, and why are they carrying guns on the ship in the first place if they have no prior knowledge of an alien race in the first place. Why does the AI always seem to know where you are, so you're forced to use the crafting system to avoid detection. Sometimes I was left in situations where I was forced to rely on spamming the load latest save button just so I could escape the creature or the people narrowly and you bet I got stuck on so many missions for so many hours just because of the horrible mechanic.

Why are the computers from the 1980s and equally slow if the game takes place in 2137? Seriously, what is up with that?

Literally I only played this game with the mindset of: When is this over, when can I see Ripley leave alive? But t just felt like an endless stepback after stepback and I didn't enjoy that, it felt like my progress was constantly being taken away from me and it felt like the devs just wanted to make an endless puzzle game of corridors, hacking computers, getting through doors, powering up systems etc, that's literally 90% of the gameplay and it wasn't fun. The visuals at first seem really good until you realize how many assets they re-use and it truly just made me feel like the devs just wanted to make a long game for no reason, it didn't have to be that long honestly.

I can't even begin to explain how many times I just felt like uninstalling the game or punching my monitor throughout this game. It's not even scary, it's annoying most of the game.

Side notes are weird floating item bugs, and after every save my flamethrower keeps making sound even though it wasn't equipped. There are also a lot of lighting related bugs like with barrels, they can't handle 2 light sources so when the lights flicker it just looks unrealistic and annoying. Also, since there are so few people, why was everyone using the transit suddenly at the end of the game? The flames were still lit after I returned to the hall at the end of the game, and most of the time I was just wondering why a ship made out of metal can burn so much? Why are the vents that big in the first place? If the vents weren't unrealistically big like that? There are just SO many questions I have and so many things that I feel enraged about from a logical perspective on why things weren't made more realistic it just didn't make the entire experience feel good, also the keybinds for the computers are just trash, I kept exiting out of the computers with Q too soon on so many occasions, just please.. the computer speeds are so annoying and the save mechanic speed too like I mentioned... also, I remember at that one marshals station where everyone gathered, the working joes came and killed everyone right? You can hear that guy shocking and then when you return you find everyone dead on the floor or the benches, how is this logical? Before I was in the room, I tested this and shot once in the air, I shot 1 of them as well and everyone panicked and ran around, you'd expect them to not just sit there and get killed by rogue androids right??? W H A T....... Like please please make a game where you think more realistically about things?

Was the story progression good? Nope. I still do not understand why the androids went rogue and why there were still some rogue ones alive, how is rewiring of an android even possible. Why was the entire station sold to WY? Why did the androids attack humans and not try to fight the aliens? How did the aliens get onboard the station in such quantities anyway, you'd expect them to take safety measurements and not storm into an alien ship like that right? Parasite? You'd have some scanners prevent that.. like the year is 2137, come on, I refuse to believe humans are actually that irresponsible and dumb, especially with designing illogical space station layouts. I would've hoped the story had a better connection with Ripley and her mother, like I wish they would've found her instead and more of the people would've survived etc etc but no, it's even unsure if Ripley herself survived. And just the fact that one of the creatures got on board Torrens as well, that just makes no sense, and it certainly makes even less sense for the creatures to be able to function in perfect vacuum."

The game itself is pretty boring most of the time. The titular alien is cool the first time it shows up, all other times it's just annoying. There's few mechanics to engage with, none of them develop past the first encounter, player tools are useless (except flamethrower) - just hide under a desk until the alien goes away, move a few rooms towards the objective, repeat for 10 hours.

The environments are incredibly boring too. Not just stylistically - there's huge chunks, series of rooms just copypasted between levels. There's like 3 variations of ""desk with computer"" throughout the entire game.

The last few hours are just filler. Made up random reasons to backtrack through levels (which are already nearly identical) just pushing buttons the game tells you to, playing the same stupid little QTEs.

I actually found it kinda boring because of this, I just really wanted to finally see the alien and then when I did I never saw it again :/ I’m not sure if it’s because I’m playing on easy mode or what, but I do wish I would run into it more often, cause for now it’s been like a walking simulator for me and I’m bored out of my mind. I only really put it on easy mode so I could be immersed in the story, which isn’t bad! It follows Ripleys daughter who is now an astronaut searching for her mother from the OG movie. I’m like 50/50 on this game and I’ll play it some more to see if anything changes with the alien, it’s too late for me to return it anyways :(  for now I can’t give a solid recommendation, so it’s a no from me.

1) Areas are too tightly made - you can hide under desks, tables, etc. but you'll find that you can't sneak away from an encounter when the alien is anywhere near you because its walking speed is faster than your sprint.

2) The alien doesn't ""learn"" like the game touts. The A.I. very clearly just knows where you are at all times and loosely follows you. If you lure it to one side of an area so that you can search another, it will inevitably follow you within the next 15 seconds.

RUN.  Away.  
I so badly wanted to love this game.  It has all of the elements for the Alien game we've all been waiting for.
Despite it's numerous and game-breaking flaws, the Alien still startles me.  

The good:
For it's age, the graphics are till wonderful.
The feel and look of the movies are here.  All of t.
The tension is very well done.
The levels are interesting, challenging, and fun.
The sound is literally award winning.

The bad:
This is the single most glitchy, buggy, steaming pile of **** that I've ever played.
It was a chore to make it to level 10 (out of 18).
The Alien AI is sometimes idiotic, and sometimes you'd swear the Alien can see through walls and floors.
Most of the time any weapon that produces a flame will cause the screen to either freeze, go completely white, or somewhere in between, but it's unplayable.  The only solution is to reload your last save.
However, once you reach level 10, you're done.  Everytime you encounter the Alien, which is about every 30 seconds, and you try  to protect  yourself, the game freezes.

For anyone doubting anything about what I've shared with you, I'm a programmer, computer and IT tech, and have tried EVERYTHING to fix it.  EVERYTHING.  Uninstalled & reinstalled twice.  Changed every single setting, in every combination.  Tried on a lesser, but still capable gaming rig at work, with the same results.
I've spent 11 hours this past week just making changes trying to get through Mission 10!

Asus Prime X470 PRO, Ryzen 7 2700X, 32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4, Nvidia RTX 3080 (F.E.), EVGA 1000W PSU.
I run Cyberpunk 2077, all of the Far Cry games, Detroit: Become Human, Crysis 3 Remastered, the original Half-Life, etc, etc, etc, without any issues.

This games is just awful.  Read the reviews from people who were invited to play the demo before it came out.  Most of them didn't even finish the demo.  Because it's absolute garbage.

And I'm probably so upset, because it has so much potential!  I can't even force myself to uninstall it, even though it is literally unplayable.  I just want it to work.  I want to finish it.  I want to like it.  I just can't."

396,2,0.4691,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","[b]Alien: Isolation[/b] is a thematically beautiful game that follows the art design of the Alien franchise masterfully, but is wrapped in a borderline frustrating, unrewarding, relentless exterior. The narrative is weak and unenjoyable, with characters acting unrealistically or even against their own interests; AI that is often absent, or bugs out and breaks, with enemies that feature hitscan weapons and unpredictable hitboxes and attack ranges; and level design that revolves around returning to the same 5 or so locales numerous times throughout the story, with the only difference being how many new enemies and objectives you will be forced to solve before progressing ad nauseum.

One of the main appeals of the game, the alien and its hunting-based AI, ranges from a mixture of annoying to stupid to outright frustrating. The alien will stalk levels, for the most part, and alternates between two modes, where it lies waiting in vents or otherwise off-screen until a loud enough noise or event trigger sets it into its next phase, hunting. Here the alien actively looks for the player, and thematically it looks wonderful. Seeing the alien’s tail as it slinks unnervingly by the desk you’re hiding under is an incredible experience. Having the alien single the player out exclusively in a room full of other humans, and target only you, while having unavoidable, instant-kill attacks, is not. It is impossible to reliably defend yourself against the alien; most weapons do nothing, at least I never saw the revolver or shotgun have any real effect. Your only defenses are fire, which revolves around molotovs and flame throwers, and otherwise stealth. Fire does not kill the alien, either. It will run away and hide for a few seconds, which is actually a detriment since it guarantees that the alien will return shortly after in hunting mode, dead set on killing you. So the flamer is relatively useless, yet as the game progresses you will find yourself using it more; not as a last resort, but rather to avoid the alien entirely as you traverse the same halls as hours before, the alien having now become more of an annoyance than a real fear.

It is puzzling in fact that CA added guns at all, since they are so utterly ineffective and useless. On the game’s recommended difficulty, enemy humans can kill you in a few shots, or maybe instantly if you’re unlucky. Yet when you turn the tables and engage them, you’ll find yourself using weapons that require multiple shots to kill a single target, while dropping scraps for ammo. The revolver is the worst for this, since it has a windup time for accuracy to increase since Ripley is otherwise incapable of aiming down the sights. The Working Joes (synthetic androids) are similarly not worth fighting, but fortunately by virtue of being slow, you can outrun them on most levels, treating them as nothing more than another compounded annoyance.

As I spoke about earlier, level design is another major let down for the game. You return to the same five or so levels each time the narrative requires you to, and the levels are generally the same with maybe a new room or two accessible now. The only real difference here is the inclusion of further, harder enemies and the alien hunting more often.

I will not include spoilers in this review, but the climax of the game comes around 2/3rds through it, and the game should have shortly ended after. Instead it drags on, with slow, arduous segments requiring you to spend 15 minutes avoiding every hostile in a level so you can walk from one hallway to the other. In the place of tension during these repeat segments, [b]Alien: Isolation[/b] is rife with quick-time events, none of which serve any purpose (and one causing you to reload a save from minutes before).

The only real difficulty here comes from a combination of level design, enemy placement, alien AI and the horrible save feature, ripped straight from [b]Resident Evil[/b], but lacking in generosity or an ability to reasonably defend yourself. Save stations are scattered around each level, and at first are plentiful and easy to reach, but as the game stretches on they become more and more spaced out. Each level eventually becomes the same: you slowly creep through a series of hallways, avoiding the alien and whatever other enemies are, and hope that you reach a save station before making a mistake.

Generally the only real threats in the game are the alien and gun-armed humans. Bugs also plague the experience. I encountered numerous times where the alien or a Working Joe would throw me into an attack animation despite being clearly multiple feet apart. When the AI wasn’t taking advantage of this, it was utterly ineffectual; often I found myself sneaking right in front of enemies and somehow remaining unnoticed.

The only good part of [b]Alien: Isolation[/b] is the theme, as I said earlier, which takes masterful advantage of the Alien franchise in order to bring you an authentic experience. The 80s-style tech and retrofuturism is ever present, but I feel that it is done a disservice, since the majority of the Sevastopol Station’s levels look virtually identical.

In summary, I would only recommend [b]Alien: Isolation[/b] to the most diehard of Alien fans. For people looking for a similar experience that is done better in mostly every single way, I would recommend 2017’s [b]Prey[/b] from Arkane Studios.

1) Forced Interaction with the Xenomorph
The Xeno AI and mechanics can be insanely frustrating and just make the game a slog to get through. More specifically, the entire medical wing level where you have to play hide and seek with it just got on my nerves so quickly. With each area in the medical wing, I took my time, made as little noise as possible, but the Xenomorph would still pop out randomly and for seemingly no reason. It would patrol the area I was in with seemingly real reason to be there. I get that there has to be a threat in an level devoid of human or android threat, but -forcing- an interaction like each time I had with the xeno and dying for an arbitrary reason just frustrated the hell out of me. Why, when I am hiding perfectly still and making no noise, would the xeno jump out of a vent, walk around for a few second, jump back in the vent and wait a few second, only to jump down again. This was all in a 30 second span where I did not: make a sound, move, or do anything to draw its attention. My friend experience the same issues as above, and completely pulled her out of an otherwise great gaming experience. Now she does not seem to be able to get immersed back into the game. 

The Xeno mechanic only starts to feel good after you link up with the marshals, and they give you a flamethrower to discourage the xeno from killing you, but even then, the it may randomly kill you, regardless. That really made me sad. All fear and tension was lost. My only thought was ""good, now I can mitigate some arbitrary bullcrap and forced tension...""

2) Android and Humans?
The androids are just annoying and not really scary. They are just resourse sinks because half the devices you can make are not needed for the xeno, but more for the android and humans of the station. Not to mention the Apollo androids in the core and server area are just frustrating. I get that there suits would insulate them from your little stun baton, but an EMP mine? Maybe if it was full shielding, but their faces are clearly exposed. It just baffles me. 

The human antagonists are just as annoying. Many a time a xeno would be in the area I would be hiding, and so would a human AI. They would see me, forget about the xeno and yell ""GUYS! OVER HERE! AN INTRUDER!!!"", and start shooting me. Excuse me, what? Should there not be a script that says when xeno is in the area ignore PC due to wanting to survive? Guess not... I am the bigger threat (which realistically, yes the PC is), but the lore and immersion wise, the xeno should be a WAY higher priority. So that would bring the xeno over, kill them and me, or I would waste flamer fuel... yay...

3) An Overstayed Experience/Sequel Bating...
The last hour of the campaign is just so unnecessarily prolonged, it is painful. While trying to link up with your Verlaine (your ship captain that dropped you off on the station), you have to run through a habitation center, avoiding the xeno while reactivating an emergency escape passage. You get all the keycards, active all the right equipment, and get to the override on the door, and surprise, surprise the generator blow out, forcing your to treck all the way back to the beginning to restart it. Not surprising, there is a forced xeno encounter that you can either stealth through or Rambo. Being fed up with the section, I chose Rambo to speed things up, wasting so much fuel. Still tacked on an additional 10 minutes to the bloated final act. After that, getting all the docking equipment in place, and heading to your escape ship there is a FORCED XENO ATTACK where it grabs you and pulls you to its next. WHAT THE FUCK?! You were at the logical end of the story, everything was only slightly bloated, and you dropped the ball. So, now you have to get back to where the ship was supposed to pick you up, an other 10-30 minutes depending if you stealthed or Rambo'ed (Rambo'ed obviously because I was frustrated at this point, again). Once back to where you were originally a new issue has to be solved because the ship you are escaping on is trapped to the stations docking mechanism. GREAT! One space walk later, unnecessary reference to Ripley setting the Nostromo to blow later. You get on the ship only to be ambushed by a xeno that found its way on board. You fling yourself and the xeno out into space, only to be spot lit by... some ship? The sequel bating is so HARD with this, it is sad. 

Why the long unnecessary final act? Sequels baby! Is Ripley impregnated with a xeno? Who knows? *Wink, wink*, *nudge, nudge*. That is the only reason I can think of for that lame, half-assed ""Ripley is captured and cacooned"" gameplay extension... fuck me that was unnecessary. Especially, canonically, Amanda Ripley dyed at age 65-67 in Aliens. It could be the WY making up bullshit, but still. Why the unnecessary end hour? Goddamn...

Overall 6/10, but I would not recommend buying it. If you get it as a gift, or for free, yeah, play it. Go watch it on YouTube..."

I've played a lot of games, and while stealth isn't usually my preferred type of action, I'm no beginner and Alien Isolation was counter-intuitive on several occasions.

- Sometimes gravity turns sideways
- Sometimes the collisions between random objects bug out, getting stuck clanging together loudly and dropping you frames until you relaunch the game
- Sometimes you will float through the ceiling or fall through the floor
- Sometimes an enemy's hit will make you spin in place, unable to move
- Humans are only susceptible to flashbangs when they feel like it
- Sometimes Steam doesn't give you an achievement when you earn it. I've killed an android dozens of times with the maintenance jack and it still never recognises it.
- Crashes to desktop occasionally
- Sometimes when it crashes it takes explorer.exe with it

You can get stuck near the end around Mission 17 if you use too many items and ammunition. This mission really requires them because the Allan will come straight at you multiple times, if you've run out then that's just too bad I guess. The flamethrower's fuel consumption is outrageous.

The Allan itself is scripted mostly well and the only gripes I have are that your tip-toeing is enough to alert it while other humans can shout all they like without attracting it. It's also on an invisible tether to you rather than free-roaming, which I don't know how to feel about.

I have a sneaking suspicion the game has been updated to feature a ""harder"" alien AI as pretty much all of the youtube videos I've seen have the alien failing to make an appearance at all, or simply walking past the player whereas I can be crouched behind an object half a room away and it goes full agro. And this is on medium compared to ""Nightmare"" that the walkthroughs claim to use. Perhaps my save file has glitched out and the alien is stuck on maximum, the game is riddled with low level bugs so I wouldn't be surprised.

Played it on Nightmare difficulty and the alien was pretty much glued to me, which led to a lot of deaths and me being annoyed of the alien's presence rather than scared. The alien also ignores other humans and guns straight for the player whenever other survivors attack you, which is really stupid. On top of that it is incredibly hard to hide and avoid the alien because it detects you way faster, leading to more annoying deaths. All that aside though, you could play it on an easier difficulty, but then you will have enough resources to trivialize any alien encounter, leading to boring gameplay and essentially running back and forth between objectives without any threat. 

To me, the potential of the game was especially apparent during the very few creepy sections where they utilized sound+ambiance to scare the player. I wish they utilized that more.

At the end of it, I don't think it was worth it personally. It's a decent game, but it isn't scary and you don't get anything out of the story by the end of it."

437,2,0.463,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","As someone who loves the Alien movies, and enjoys both horror and stealth games, it's frustrating that I can't recommend this game. The ambience, the music, the ship's design, it's all top notch. Ripley's ragged breathing and muffled screams amplify the tension you feel in every nearby sound; was that noise sparks from that nearby severed wire? Or the xenomorph scuttling around behind you? I was filled with excitement and dread for the first few hours of this game, and the buildup was masterful.

So it's a shame that the game can't rely on gravitas forever, because as soon as you get to the actual gameplay (stealth) you realise how terribly made it is. Enemies will spot you behind cover, in the dark, fifty metres away, while you can't even see them on your screen. I crouched basically everywhere, but I probably should've just run because enemies always detected me no matter how safely I played.

This silly stealth design is how the game justifies its inventory/crafting system. You can make flashbangs, smoke bombs, flares, etc, which are interesting ways to avoid or distract enemies, but don't mean anything if you're good enough to sneak past enemies without them. Thus, the game makes its sneaking horribly ineffective to force you to use the items, which (if you use them properly) essentially just let you waltz past the difficult encounters.

Not only is this frustrating design that removes strategy and nullifies stealth skill, it exacerbates the game's trial-and-error problem. Some enemy encounters are so pathetically easy to avoid you definitely don't need to use items, whilst some are so absurdly unfair that you basically have to use items, and there's not really any way to know which is which until you die and think ""ok, gotta use an item there."" The game is basically long stretches of no real threat until you die, reload and use an item at the part that killed you.

Alien Isolation has a really cool premise and great atmosphere, but it bungles it so much with gameplay that I can't recommend it unless you really don't mind this trial-and-error faux difficulty. If this game had less items and more logical stealth, it would have been a slam dunk. Hell, the motion sensor alone is a really cool and well-implemented idea. But it's hard to enjoy those wins in the face of this game's glaring, shallow stealth design."

441,2,0.3902,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","Alien: Isolation is a really strange game that can't seem to decide what it wants to be. On the one hand, the almost constant threat of the alien forces the player to run and hide, carefully managing scarce resources and getting out of harms way as quickly as possible. On the other hand, hundreds of scattered collectibles, audio logs, and emails around the station encourage exploration to get the most out of the story. As a result, the game fails both as a survival horror experience and as a story-driven exploration into the Alien universe.

The only emotions the game consistently manages to evoke throughout the campaign are frustration, rage, and boredom. Lack of a save system and the random nature of the encounters, means that the player is forced to repeat the same sections over and over until successfully getting to the next checkpoint. Considering there are countless items to scavenge and collectibles to find, the experience is more akin to playing Edge of Tomorrow than an Alien game as the player is eventually trained to disregard the alien entirely in favor of exploring, dying, exploring some more, memorizing the layout, and eventually succeeding at navigating the area successfully, collecting everything on the way, and repeating the entire process in the next mission. This removes any feelings of suspense and causes endless frustration instead as even interacting with terminals is a constant source of deaths because enemies are all too eager to sneak up on Ripley while she is busy checking emails or listening to audio logs.

The first few levels actually do a very good job telling an interesting story and keeping the player on the edge and in suspense. But it all goes out the window the moment the alien first appears and is pretty much all downhill from there as the story is very predictable and lacking much sense, especially for the last few missions. For instance, aliens, apparently, like to patrol their territory, walking room to room, occasionally stopping to ponder the meaning of life, and then resuming their patrol. With the exception of a few scripted sequences, they don't stalk their prey or setup ambushes. They just patrol hallways. Aliens also, apparently, cannot be killed. Not with shotguns, nor with flamethrowers, or even pipe bombs and molotovs. They don't even bleed when shot. In fact, there is not a single acid burnt surface in the entire game. And considering that everything kills Ripley instantly, that most enemies can be avoided entirely, and that resources are in abundance, it really begs the question of why items like medkits, flash and smoke grenades, and flares are even in the game.

Considering that most items are useless and that audio logs really do not shed much light on the story, the entire exploration aspect becomes redundant and boring, offering no reward whatsoever. And that's the problem with the game in general - none of it is rewarding, but all of it is frustrating. The aliens are lame, the ending is lame, and even the DLCs where the player gets to play through some of the iconic scenes from the original movie are lame. Both missions are so short that the developers couldn't even be bothered to add save files for them, forcing the player to finish them in one sitting or start from scratch. And the majority of time is spent trying to figure out where to go in the labyrinthine layout of the Nostromo, which makes no sense as Ripley should be familiar with the layout of the ship. Which reminds me... Despite downloading every single map I could find throughout the entire space station, there was not a single area for which the map was usable.

Like the missing maps, the entire game is one huge missed opportunity. You get to watch Ripley push every kind of button, pull every kind of lever, and hack every kind of terminal imaginable, but things like putting on a space suit, flying a shuttle around the space station, or even escaping an exploding ship could not be animated for some reason. If the game was more story-driven, more cinematic, and more scripted, it would have been a very different and much better experience, but it tries to do everything at once and misses every mark."

Then it became a snooze fest... move, hide, wait... move, hide, wait... and that is all you ever do. Sure you have weapons or noisemakers or flashbangs, but all those do is provide more time to move, to find a place to hide, to wait...

The movie did a great job with this same situation, but that was a movie. It was an hour and a half long, and even when someone died the movie progressed. Getting caught in the middle of a 20 minute hike to the objective, and bouncing back to 20 minutes ago only to have to move, hide, wait, in the same area you already moved, hid, and waited, just makes for a dull experience. 

Eventually  I just started sprinting by the dumb AI androids, and if the Alien jumped out... well, at least I didn't waste 20 minutes, and it was only 5 minutes of redoing...

Not to mention I know of a few 4 developers of games who know how to properly design a females body but ultimately they all suck at when it comes to proper design of female body. I truly believe that the only people who have the brains and smarts act creating proper females body are modders and not the game developers.

I've watched all the alien movies and as I recall they had more weaponry not just shotguns, pistols (which were used as a secondary last resort weapon that the developers of this game screwed up on really badly), but they also had assault rifles, mini guns as well as turrets that they can deploy.

To make it even worse about this game is that you can't kill the alien in this game that is stalking you (the player) because in the movies and books they can be killed but in this game you can't. Kinda reminded me of Resident Evil 5 where a giant zobie guy or what ever they called him in that game basically could not die the player was forced to run basically for his life completing or trying to complete objectives after a few thousand times of death before he finely dies via scripting. Don't know what these developers where thinking going off book like this but its pure stupid. Players don't want and need to die a thousand times or have to use mods to save themselves, the developers should have thought of this matter first and considered the fact hey maybe if we just add a few thousand aliens that can be killed that stock the player that way they can kill them and escape and not just run for they're lives and eventually quit playing the game.

I also think that they should have worked harder with the overall item use such as the med kits that the player can craft. For instance in a player comes along seeing an injured person that they don't shoot first but rather allow the player to choose to help them first by giving one or two or how ever many the player can spare to heal the wounded with those, not to make the player think ""oh well they're dead anyway move on now"". Have these developers not watched the moves at all or am I the only person with a brain the aliens don't attack when people are together unless they have enough of them equal or more of them compared to the humans. Even a 2 year old well more like a 7 year old would know this and figure this out.

I think this one is kinda down grading both the developers of this game and the movie directors of the films but the ships that they have in Alien series can hold more then 8 people Alien 2 movie it should the military cruiser and the hangar bay with only 16 people operating the entire ship that includes the marines on board in the cryo pods. That is truly sad for a ship of that size that only supports 16 people more like pathetic and what the hell are these screw ups are thinking. Ships of those sizes should hold at least 5 thousand people on board, the crew is around 2500 or 3000 where as the marines are the rest. Cruisers most people might not know this originally are bigger then battleships but with fewer gun emplacements then the battleships and were typically 2 times larger focusing as command ships and specialty in subsystems. Kinda sad playing through this game you could not see any marines in action or watching them deploy in the station, but no the developers wanted a Resident Evil outlook on things they should have stuck with making the next Resident Evil game that I don't play at all and had someone with a proper brain make a better game in they're stead of Alien."

453,3,0.7381,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Okay so this is a weird one. It was recommended to me to play the hardest difficulty, which is something I wouldn't typically do, especially on a first playthru. I honestly think that it overall negatively impacted my opinion of the game, which I had trouble pushing myself to get all the way through. 

My biggest issue with this game is that due to the saving system, you can lose lots and lots of time worth of progress for making a mistake. This made some sections and encounters truly a slog, especially with how little rope the game gives you at the highest difficulty. At a certain point I am not afraid of the alien anymore, I am afraid of all of the time wasted.

Another weird side note, I think I had some technical problems with sound. Something about it was off-timed in many cases, which would really suck the suspense out of what should have been an intense moment. 

There was plenty to like as well, but I don't really think I enjoyed myself overall when I look back on the big picture. Giving this a thumbs up or a thumbs down is a tough call for me. I think if you're a horror fan or an Alien fan this is kinda a no brainer purchase. If you're not one of those two things you really gotta ask yourself how much of a stealth game fan you are. If you're not a fan of stealth games either this is really not for you. 

I don't typically like to be negative if I don't have to be, but I can't in good conscience recommend a game that I didn't really like, so it's gonna have to be a thumbs down from me. Just know that my experience might not be the average players experience and I'm also not really a horror fan, so take what I say about it with a grain of salt."
454,1,0.5923,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I don't understand why this game gets so much praise. It is one of the worst stealth games I've ever played, their is nothing worst that bad poorly thought out sneaking when that is suppose to be the main mechanic. The Alien seems smart at first till you realize it can teleport when ever the game feels like it and pop out in front of you as you slowly crouch walk through the same damn hallways. So The entire game is find the thing open door, then find the other thing to open another door. No real puzzles to keep you thinking you just stumble around blindly till you find the thing that opens the door. Not to mention every area has other locked doors that require a blowtorches or plasma cutters, which foreshadows all of the backtracking you'll need to do. The main game loop is open door, get killed by the Xenomorph while you trial and error style search the room for a thing to open the next door, knowing the next room is going to be the exact same thing plus or minus android and humans. To top off this cluster-fuck the game is amazingly boring, I watch two of the Alien movies (Alien, Aliens) while playing just to keep me interested, but alas it didn't work. Snooze time for sure. I'm sorry I can no longer slog through this. Apparently I don't love Aliens as much as I thought. I played on Hard not the Hardest, that's the recommend setting according to the developers but from what I've read most player choose to play on the easiest setting and seem to have a blast, but I still don't see how. The game just sucks.

I did manage to finish it and well, yeah it SUCKS.

Too the Developer:
You deserve no praise for this, I regret buying it. Also you realize the android in the first movie was take down with a single blow from a fire extinguisher to the face, so why do your android take endless revolver head-shots with out flinching? It knocked his Ash's head clean off by the way."

When I first got it, it had some bad performance issues so I sat on it for a while until the bugs were worked out.
Fast forward to this past week. I reinstalled the game. Not far into the game I got stuck in an area where the alien kept killing me. I restarted it and put it on the lowest skill level thinking it was just me.
Nope. Kept getting railroaded in the same area and the last time I got killed, the alien had come up from behind me in a small room I was exiting. When I returned to that room I looked around and there was no possible way the alien could have gotten in that room behind me. No vents, doors, mouse holes...nothing. It just either blinked into the room or clipped through the walls.
I really wanted to like this game and I might try again from time to time, but I'm let down that, after all this time, the game has such idiotic bugs in it like that which suck the fun right out of it.
So...I can't recommend it in good conscience."

I'd rather this game lasted for 4 hours with superb quality than this over extended ""story"" 

The ship where it takes place is so massive yet it looks so repetitive after the initial part. The Ishimura is boring, most of the time its just corridors and rooms all the time, one after another - thanks to the map you can navigate it because without it that would be impossible.

The xenomorph chase... its just annoying most of the time and the AI is just bad. How come the ship is so damn big yet he is always behind us? We don't know if its always the same xeno but still it makes no sense. How come human NPCs are around the ship knowing theres xenos around and act like nothing is happening...? You can get killed by it 2 meter away from an NPC and they just dont even care lol most of the time they rather shoot you instead of the alien.

You are supposed to sneak and not make noise yet the main character makes a lot of noise everytime she hides inside a locker or makes noise when playing videos/audios on computers.... Really? Makes no sense and breaks the atmosphere.

This game does exactly what a hundred cheap/f2p horror games on steam does but under the Alien IP and all the economical push it has. It has nothing special to it.

461,1,0.7938,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Unfortunately, Alien Isolation is a slog. An hour of walking before anything happens. I looked up some gameplay because I wanted to know when the game picks up after I just spent an entire hour walking around the base with nothing happening. Im shocked how boring this game is.

Most doors and interactable generators take 10-20 seconds before the opening animation finishes. Keep in mind doors are very frequent, so you can easily spend a lot of time waiting around for the animation to finish. Other doors require you to play braindead ""Mini-games"" like match the symbol or line up the circle, absolutely no challenge. If these mini games sound boring, Do not play this game as 90% is walking to the next door to play a minigame or watch a 20 second animation of your character taking a lock off a door. I would get it if you had to avoid the alien or Droids during these long processes, but there is only a 30 minute section in a 21 hour game where opening these doors has any sort of tension due to nearby enemies.

Stealth mechanics are inconstant, sometimes people walk right by you and they don't notice you, other times they spot you immediately. Stealth consists of hiding behind boxes or in lockers.

The only thing I like is the atmosphere of the ship.

The game devs wanted to make an alien game, but forgot that the game needed to be a game, not a door opening simulator."

465,1,0.4491,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Played on normal difficulty.

Start of the game looked promising. First few levels have a good game design (minor spoilers): you are alone, then you meet a friendly guy, then non-friendly humans (and you get past them with the help of the friendly one), then you have to deal with humans and androids by yourself. That's progressive difficulty while providing a tutorial, in a way.

Alien comes in play. Since the first level with it (medical bay), the game just sucks. Ok, I get it, the AI is good, but level design is beyond terrible. Imagine the devs: ""We designed an area that player needs to get across and back to deliver a medical supply. Can we make it larger? Neah, it would take time. How about forcing the player to go back and forth FOUR times in order to pass the level... Oh, did I mention, you need to deviate from the route by a lot in order to save your progress? Brilliant!"". The level forces you to go North, South, North, South and so on, and the save point is in the West side of the area. This level is not just an example, there are more levels like this through the entire game. The game no longer is terrifying anymore after flamethrower, it just becomes frustrating. Everytime the alien senses you, you can just burn it a bit. OK, I know, I played on normal difficulty (that's how I usually play games for the first time). I guess on harder difficulty the player needs to be more stealthy, but still same frustration will appear.

Besides the terrible game design, there comes the poor story. It is unreal for a human to survive that long in a real scenario. In the end (SPOILERS!), [spoiler] after ALL you've done to keep bitch Riley alive, she sacrifices to save the Torrens. SHE COULD JUST BURN THE ALIEN INSTEAD. Ok, she was in her space suit, she couldn't use flamethrower. WHY THE FU*K SHE DIDN'T TAKE OFF HER SUIT WHEN SHE ARRIVED ON TORRENS?? [/spoiler]"
466,3,0.3858,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Everything you have been told about this game is a lie - the story is terrible and it isn't one bit scary. It is the absolute worst game I have ever played. I will never understand why there are so many positive reviews or why it seems to have such a following.

The game throws you into itself with very little guidance or training as to what you can and cannot do. This is so bad that it becomes a chore figuring out how to reload your guns and how to use a medipack, and so google is the only option. It is also near impossible to know what you are meant to interact with at times and so you have to hover your mouse over nearly everything in order to see if it glows or not. The endless backtracking is also god awful and the level design really is monotonous and pedantic.

That aside, the game is not one tiny bit scary. The only fear and dread that you will experience is that the overly sentient Alien or overly powerful androids will kill you instantly, and so you will have to retrace the past 30 minutes from the last checkpoint for the 20th time. That is all the horror there is to it. Your weapons are virtually useless because shooting immediately attracts the Alien, but shooting is the only way to deal with the annoying androids that will get in the way of you making any progress. Also, spending the entire game crawling just so I could progress really isn't my idea of fun. I tried switching difficulty settings from Normal, to Easy, and even to Novice, and it made no difference - the game remained beyond annoying. 

A lot of people have said that the story is great and would make a good movie - hell no. You get almost no chance to really care about your two friends whom you have to save later on in the story, and the ending is extremely unsatisfying after playing through such a nightmare. What is worse is that the game is not only you vs. the Alien but also you vs. countless NPCs, so I did not feel very isolated during Alien: Isolation. 

The only saving grace this game has is that the music and atmosphere are both good, hearkening back to the original 1979 Alien movie of which I am a big fan. Everything else though is an unplayable disaster. I don't like games that continuously hold my hand - but come on: you have to give us some training and understanding of the mechanics (plus ways to actually defeat and navigate all the hostiles) that isn't just based around endless trial and error (plus luck) due to the Alien's randomized behavior. If this game had been made by an Indie developer, I could turn a blind eye to some of the bad choices it makes. Instead, it is a horrendous gaming experience, with zero replay value, and not scary whatsoever. Utter flush-able excrement saturated garbage."
467,1,0.8307,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back",This game can be summed up in one sentence. Flip the switch to open the door so that you can flip another switch to open another door but oh wait some random issue means you now have to backtrack and start a generator. And you do this for hours on end all the while your crouching around hiding and moving through vents because there is always some enemy in the way. If you want to experieance the game just watch someone play it. Save your money.
468,1,0.3527,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I say this as a major fan of the Alien franchise and basically all of the crossover games, including the AVP RTS game that came out on console over a decade ago. This has to be the most broken, and fundamentally unplayable game I have ever experienced. I am on nightmare, and the game has 0 tension. Not because the game has no atmosphere, or that the game isn't scary enough. This game is broken. Every mission I have been on has had at least 1 section that requires a restart because the section won't load a cutscene when I am at the correct point, or my personal favorite, it spawns the Alien on top of me as I load my save. I make no noise, slowly crawl around in the dark, and guess what? The AI doesn't give a fuck. It knows where I am. And this is where the game is laughable. The AI CAN'T see me when I full on sprint up to a group of people with guns, and loudly bludgeon them to death and they just casually watch as I walk up to them and so the same. Worst part, these are the same sections of the game I get ""stuck"" on. I have put in 10 hours so far, and I am not kidding when I say that about 80 percent of my game time has been spent on 2 parts of the game, because the AI is so broken I can't go through the sections, stealthy or not. Only purchase this game if you want the experience and pain of slamming your head into a wall until your skull cracks."
469,3,0.4784,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This is more of a neutral review. This is by no means a bad game, and if you like survival horror genre and/or Alien film series (especially the original 1979 film), you will most likely enjoy it.
I really wanted to like this game - I liked the attention to detail and how the atmosphere and aesthetics of the original Alien film were recreated, but the game for the most part wasn't really enjoyable or scary for me, but in a word, annoying.
The level design can be confusing at times - more than often I had to check the map to see where I'm supposed to go, and the goal marker doesn't show you on what floor your objective is. Even in small areas, I had to double-check the map to see what I need to interact with. I think I wasted at least 2 hours on numerous instances of aimless wandering until I decided to look up a wakthrough on youtube because it's not always clear where you need to go or what you need to interact with.
The save terminals weren't a big issue for me, but the game would've been better if it had a checkpoint system, in my opinion.
I understand what the devs were going for with the Alien AI, and overall it's pretty good, but it's often inconsistent with its behavior - sometimes you can sneak near it around a small table or a box, and it won't notice you, but sometimes it will charge at you when you're behind a wall and you didn't make a single noise. Working Joes can also be very annoying, and by the section where you're forced to give up your firearms to proceed, I seriously considered ragequitting the game.
The game can also become a buggy mess at times - I often encountered instances of: 1) voice lines or audio logs not playing, 2) mission objectives not updating, 3) objects floating in mid-air, 4) working Joes and human enemies standing still when they should be attacking, 5) corner tears with visible sky box, and such graphical glitches, etc.
The plot was interesting at first, because you're playing as Ripley's daughter, and finding Nostromo audio logs was nice fan service, but the more it went on, the more it felt like a drag, and I didn't have the feeling of involvement that much. If the game was shorter and characters such as Axel weren't killed off too soon, it would've been a better experience, I'm sure. Also, I didn't like the ending much; even Aliens Colonial Marines had more closure than this!
Maybe survival horror genre just isn't for me. I do like shooting games more, and as a fan of the Alien films, whenever I replay Aliens Colonial Marines, I'm having a blast (maybe I'm a bit biased, as I like Aliens and Alien 3 a bit more than the original Alien). Alien Isolation is not a bad game, but I have no desire to replay it, unfortunately.

Survivor Mode DLCs can be enjoyable for those who liked the base game, but Crew Expendable and especially Last Survivor DLCs are a must play for the fans of the original Alien film, and it was really nice to hear the original actors once again in this (but I have just one gripe - as far as I know, Jonesy the cat is nowhere to be found in these DLCs (even though the box Ripley was carrying him in the film is present), and even Aliens Colonial Marines had Jones as an easter egg in the Nostromo map for Survivor mode)."

But there was something in the AI of the Alien that just didn't sit right - it felt like it was targeting the player, not like it was a wild creature in a human environment. Examples: why would the Alien ignore soldiers shooting at it to attack little old me crouched in the corner? And why would the Alien only ever seem to circle me like a goddamn fly despite other NPCs being clearly audible nearby? Parts felt difficult but fair, others felt cheap and ridiculous - the game bends its own rules, I suppose, in the name of making it ""scarier"" but it just ends up frustrating."

1. the nonexistent and/or opaque stealth system. A lot of the game revolves around evading the alien. However it is never clear how to do this successfully. Hiding under tables or in lockers are a coin toss on whether it works or not. Throwables are also dubious in their usefulness. It feels like an underdeveloped part of the game, but you're relying on it a lot, or else you're getting instakilled by an area and doing the same area over and over until you get lucky.
2. the game is just too long. The game has too many false climaxes, and combined with how frustrating the stealth aspect of the game is it just wears out its welcome long before its over.

A better tuned stealth system or a shorter game would have been sweet. This just became onerous before I could finish it."

481,3,0.5825,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","""Kill Androids: Isolation"" is a long and interesting game that features an alien every now and again. However, it is a shame they decided to make an interesting game instead of a good one. For the most of the game you fight Working Joes and get to enjoy all the jank they offer! Also in later stages they even respawn out of thin air as you progress. Even when playing on the hardest difficulty the game is not hard, but very annoying. 

The famous ""AI"" of the Alien is nothing special. It is quite silly in fact and the undeserved hype over it just makes it laughable. In this game a cat does not lead every single character to their deaths like in the original movie. Instead the Alien stalks the player, usually just gets lost and then teleports back. He/she keeps coming back to the rooms the player is in even if you are in complete silence. There might be 10 humans in the next room, but the Alien is only after Ripley Jr.'s butt. I found myself annoyed by the Alien every time he/she was present, but when the Alien was not there I got fed up with fighting Working Joes. Sometimes the Alien got stuck on debris and just bugged out before disappearing.

Amanda Ripley is an awesome character and does a lot for the good of this game. There are good supporting characters as well, but because it is a horror game *SPOILERS* they all die. It seems just pointless after a while, they are just killing off characters for the sake of it. Just bad and clumsy writing. The ending also makes no sense at all. 

After playing this quite a lot and suffering for more than half of the game, I cannot recommend this unless you get it cheap or for free. Aliens vs. Predator made in 2010 is a great game and until they make a new game in which they improve on the many elements Kill Androids:Isolation did wrong, I suggest you play AvP2010.

482,3,0.466,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","so to start off with i'm going to outline that its a impressive game for its sound and its graphical design, it really drops you into the world of alien and makes you feel part of that universe. The jump scare moments are great and the AI for the alien is great where it learns your movements and your common hiding spaces. Unfortunately, this is about the only positives of the game... I wont go into too much detail as want to be spoiling anything so will do bullet points. 
The level design is boring and repetitive (having to do the same tasks on pretty much all of the sections... turning on generators, pressing a button or turning a switch) 
The constant back peddling is more than frustrating 
The game play is all the same, after about 2 hours you've done it all and been given the same scenarios and are basically just a forced crouch errand girl.
The characters are empty and have zero personality 
The fact you HAVE to crouch everywhere because the alien will hear you if you even think about standing up and walking normally or running (dont run anywhere) 
The game is way too long (they could have cut 4 sections out specifically and the game wouldnt have lost anything) 
Having to manual save.... this doesnt make it a horror nor does it make for a new and interesting feature its just frustrating having to replay long sections without having save points"
483,1,0.7183,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I really tried to like this game. LOVED the atmosphere and the story. Made it 5 or 6 chapters in and got bored.

The alien just spends WAY too much time hanging around 1-20 meters around where you are at any given time. In a huge sprawling level with plenty of humans walking around making tons of noise, the alien is completely fixated on finding you even if you're nearly perfectly silent.

I just spent 15 minutes hiding in a closet with my motion detector pinging and the SOB chilling 0.17 arbitrary distance away in a vent directly above me. He'd occasionally shuffle back and forth a couple feet. Eventually I got bored and hit it with the one molotov I'd crafted (which is supposed to make it run away), but the thing moved so fast that the death animation started before it felt the burn.

If the alien would just f*** of for like 5 minutes at a time or something, then it showing up might be tense + nerve-wracking. As it stands, it's just a chore because you have to splinter cell your way through every single room and corridor when it's around. Crafting and throwing a noisemaker to distract it will buy you like 30 seconds of peace.

488,1,0.4192,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","It starts off REALLY strong and then dips off in enjoyability over time. The AI completely ruins it for me. Rather than the alien actually looking for you, the game already knows exactly where you are, so it just pretends to look for you in a little area around you. It gets really bad once you get the flamethrower, since that's when the alien's abilities ramp up, and it gets more aggressive (I think). At that point, it gets really obvious that the game is just teleporting the alien to whatever vent it needs to be at. One time it set up a trap in one of the overhead vents, and the INSTANT I walked past it, it jumped out of the vent in front of me. It moved so fast that there were still spit particles coming from the vent it was just in.

If the AI was actually fair, and hunted you based on real factors rather than just level scripting, this would easily be a 9/10 or a 10/10 game. It nails the Alien atmosphere perfectly, and stuff like the motion tracker translates into gameplay REALLY well. My issue is just that the AI is horrendously cheap, so neither your victories nor your deaths feel actually deserved."

Yes, this gets you absorbed in the game, but also leaves you lost, wandering around, wondering what the heck to do. THERE IS NO AUTOSAVE. If you die, you will reload at your last save, so have fun backtracking through corridors and hiding from wandering people. 

Oh, and THE FLASHLIGHT IS THAT STUPID HEADSET. I had to use Google to find the stupid flashlight, because, once again, the game does not show you where the items are. Heck, it doesn't even tell you that their flashlights are different than a normal flashlight.

491,1,0.5762,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Only Aliens recommend this game. Humans should not play this space waste.

Your main job is that going to the same route back and forth a hundred time to turn on/off breakers and sometimes distract Aliens or some plastic bald head, that's it.

Some enemies have instant kill so you are forced to die a couple of times to figure out your strategy. A bad news is since this game had a few checkpoints, you would easily waste 30 minutes playing and have to do the same errand and watch UNSKIPPABLE scenes over and over again.

No time to read documents, craft materials and solve puzzles, because this game doesn't stop the time while you doing these things. If you would hear the Alien's sound while you solving a puzzle to unlock the door, you were  fu**ed and your 30 minutes playing was gone. Just restart the last checkpoint.

A rough hit box. You miss zero distant shot to enemies whereas they suddenly warp to near your position to kill instantly although there was an enough distance. Perhaps when the dev started making this game their brain had already been hollow by Alien's attack.

The low-quality script. This game should be taken over 10 hours to beat. I strongly recommend watching Alien 1 to 3  or just taking a breath instead.

If you are a true Alien fan, at least you would enjoy this game as the walking Alien's world simulator for a while, but 2 hours would be enough, after that just request the refund."

Instead, the game tries to keep you in a heightened state of tension ALL THE GODDAMN TIME, and when you couple that with a poorly explained stealth system (next to no tutorials), clunky, plodding movement, and an invincible enemy that never just BACKS THE FUCK OFF FOR A WHILE, the game ends up being exhausting.

This game is ok. The Alien is absolutely terrifying AT FIRST. Its smart, its hunting you, you hide and sneak around, occasionally getting past it by the skin of your teeth. But, more often than not, you get caught, the Alien kills you. It kills you a lot. You learn to hide better, but the Alien won't fuck off. Its camping on top of the objective. For 15 minutes. You sit in your hiding spot waiting for it to move, but it basically knows where you are, but it can't find you. You set off distractions, it ignores them, they are too far away from you for it too care. The Alien only cares about you.

As far as I'm concerned, all the AI praise that was thrown around for this game was nothing but marketing BS. You're playing hide and seek with an enemy that can insta kill you and it always knows roughly where you are. Its not scary after the 50th death, its annoying.

The game certainly has its moments though, maybe the fear factor won't wear off for you. It did for me though, and that made things boring."

I don't feel smart when I succeed and I don't feel guilty when I lose. i just feel The game killed me or it didn't. To be honest, when i got to a bug that stops the game and I have to reload from an ancient save to try again, I was happy to have an excuse to stop playing. I really wanted to enjoy this.

Plus, having to respawn over and over again BEFORE an unkippable cutscene, or some sodding task makes dying less of a spooker, and more of a ""Damn, I have to do all that crap again."" -- that's just not satisfying to me.

The controls are clunky, you can't jump fo instance, and trying to get away from enemies is a pain for it.

The AI of the enemies is odd, sometimes they will follow you and kill you, other times they ignore you.

The alien works in full on cheat mode.  Why doesn't it take out all the other lifeforms in the station?  No, we'll ignore them and focus solely on me...and the way it moves from one side of the level to the other is suspect (as you find out if you read any technical background or delve into the AI files).

Alien 1 is one of my favorite horror films and this game does manage to capture the atmosphere perfectly, but the gameplay is nothing but frustrating. Almost every encounter in the game requires you to die several times first before knowing where to go and what to avoid, and even worse there is no reliable checkpoint system in-place. Dying means rewatching cutscenes, listening to expositional dialogue sequences all over again, and repeating multi-step objectives that will involve you having to avoid insta-death scenarios for lengthy stretches of time with no save points available. 

Even though there is an entire ship for the Xenomorph to roam around, it seemingly only searches (at most) up to 1 room away from Ripley at any given moment. Being seen means being caught & its ears are 100x more reliable than the equipment given to the player in-game. I really really want to like this game, but unless they suddenly update it with a quicksaving feature then I'm not interested in playing anymore sadly. You end up forgetting what fear feels like & instead become much more intimate with tedium & annoyance.

525,3,0.4465,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I rarely, if ever write a review for any kind of game, i'm honestly not that person, but I definitely had to write one for this
. In fact, I think this is my first  review ever! I wanted to write a review about how horrible this game actually is. I admit, like many other gamers, at first glance this game seemed to have real promise. The atmosphere, graphics and a couple other notable elements to this game were at first exhilarating. Except, the reason for this review is not because of the good that I found in this game, but the overwhelmingly bad. 

The bad
1. The monotony of the game: It seemed like every new area/level you would explore, there had to be power and/or some kind of security crap you had to turn back on. I could say so much more about this between the Xenomorph (alien), tasks, androids, humans, and the list could go on, but I don't care that much to write a 10 page review.
2. Lack of story: The story line of this game probably bothered me the most in that...THERE WAS NO STORY LINE...I can confidently say that trying to find a medpack for your buddy or finding a way to kill the alien is not a story line in it's self. Heck, maybe there was!? But I probably was too busy being bored and turning on the power to notice.
3. Very little character development: There is more character development in 5 nights at Freddy's than this game.
4. Predictable: Holy Moses, after about the 3rd run in with the alien I knew everything about it. How to avoid, how to survive, and how to twiddle my thumbs. After knowing little there is to know about the alien, I no longer had that adrenaline rush or fear of getting caught, I just ran, walked, and crouched when needed. 
5. All hiding and no killing: To be honest, this one isn't that high on the cons list, more of an annoyance. But man, I got tired of hiding and cowering in the corner every 5 seconds and not being able to do much shooting or killing. You do have opportunities to kill, but not often.


If I sat for another hour or two I think I could come up with at least 5 more complaints, but I neither have the time nor care. My final say and review to this game is a BIG thumbs down! I have never been more disappointed in game as much as this one. I tried to like it, but I really couldn't, it was just that bad. If you are on the edge on whether you should buy this game or not.....please don't, it was a big waste of my time, and not that fun after about 3-4 hrs of play. I am going to finish though...hopefully soon.
"
526,3,0.4263,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Let me be honest. The game is cool, the art department nailed the 1979 style spaceship vibe, and the game has a really cool feel. If you're a fan of the original Ridley Scott film this is a must.

BUT - I'm getting a little tired of running around like a cuck reactivating power cores, or over-riding security protocols. Literrally every area I get into..""Ridley. looks like the power is out. Find a way to turn it back on, then over ride the security"". Just give me some real shot gun ammo and let me fck these androids for once."

However, I am the opposite. I like stealth but Alien: Isolation takes it to another level. It is TOO hardcore for me to a point that it makes me feel like a coward. I cannot kill anything except for robots. On top of that, the story of the game sucked. As a fan of the movies, I am a little disappointed at the game. The purpose of the game felt a little pointless to me. The whole point of the game is to escape a giant space station that has a Xenomorph in it. Although this was also the point of the movie, the movie was interesting and kept me engaged with the scary atmosphere the actions. Whereas for the game, although it does a good job creating an intense atmosphere, there aren't any actions. The game makes you feel powerless against the Xenomorph and you are constantly in hiding from it. The story is also very disappointing, it is literally just fixing varies things in the space station while hiding from the Xenomorph. Even though you have weapons, you can rarely use them because every time you do, the Xenomorph will track you down and there is nothing you can do. I will say though, the design of Sevastopol is really good. It makes me feel like being in a real space station. It is really a shame because I feel like the game could actually be good if the story is more engaging. However, that is not the case, the story was very lackluster."

It's visually stunning and aurally stunning, but the gameplay is lacking. Near the end of the game, I kept getting found by the Alien again and again, and I noticed why: I was rushing, and I was rushing because I was bored and wanted it to be over with.

For me, Alien Isolation hours of running around a mostly sameish looking space station, hiding, dying, walking slowly, crawling slowly, watching unskippable/repetitive animations, and reloading your save. The death-to-try again time is too damn long. I started skipping the Alien murder scenes after a while, and just reloaded my previous save. To load and earlier game, you have to open the Menu, click Load current/previous save, and confirm it. Takes 5+ seconds every time which might not seem like much, but it adds up quite quickly.

Again, I really *wanted* to like this game. The Alien franchise is my all-time favorite in the realm of sci-fi horror, and I really hope it gets a deserving game one day. If Creative Assembly had put as much effort into the gameplay as it did with the visual and audio aesthetics, we'd probably have an all-time classic on our hands. Such as it is, Alien Isolation is mainly filled with tedium and jump scares.

Investing a lot of (sometimes frustrating) hours in this game, dying over a hundred times at the hands of the alien (there's an achievement for that, though i wasn't aiming for it!) and the other denizens of Sevastopol, I felt swindled. Yes, I know in this game it's about the experience, but how about a little reward for the player for making it through your game? SOMETHING LONGER THAN YOUR MEASLY 15 SECOND ENDING!"

The atmosphere, music, detail, Alien AI, characters, and stealth. Speaking of the Alien's AI, it is truly impressive, and I recommend watching some youtube videos that go in depth into how it works for some really neat insights. But then, we have the cons: Humans suck because, while predictable (which is good in a stealth game), they are not really a threat (unless you're trying to get the achievement, which I was). As for Androids, you can just kill them without consequences, which gets old. Additionally, there are some missions that are extremely dull (anything where you have to put on the space suit). But these cons pale in comparison to the biggest one of all - the ending. If you don't care about the ending, then get the game and have fun, but if you do care then HOLY SHIT. Level 17 is constrained and linear for the most part, and level 18 is a bunch of cheap jump scares, ""but wait, there's more!"" moments, and scripted bullshit that makes no fucking sense. This last level has so much monotony and unnecessary button-pushing and lever-pulling that it would have to have a satisfying payoff, right? Nope. Fast forward a few more QTE's and you get an extremely frustrating ending, for reasons I wont delve into here more than I already have. In conclusion, a lot of this game is really fun and good, but its ending drags it down so much that I cannot in good conscious recommend it to anyone but die-hard Alien fans or to folks who don't care at all about the story."

It gets very repetitive and by the end it practically forces you to drop stealth entirely and adapt to fighting the alien head on.

554,3,0.5848,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","At the point of writing this I'm pretty far into the game(not knowing how much left though) on Hard - ""as it's meant to be experienced"". I have seen the earlier installments of the Alien series in my youth, but not a big fan by any means.

Graphics are pretty good for a game of its time, and even better considering how the experience holds up today. While a spaceship as always is dreary metal panels all around they manage to spice it up with plenty of color. The character models are stellar, especially the Xenomorph with the death animations a thrill to watch(love those perfect teeth). Sound conveys the atmosphere very well and together with the visuals I am constantly reminded of the earlier Alien installations I used to watch late nights with the family on our 14"" CRT. Just breathtaking.

The gameplay is where it doesn't do it for me. In a challenge, I constantly look for that sweet spot between boredom and frustration and the game often lies in the latter region, especially with the scarce save spots, a sore point for me. The game being 'hard' isn't even a chain of challenge events - just ten-ish tasks of gathering and crafting things, exploring before the big game of hide-and-seek,  and if you fumble that - DO EVERYTHING AGAIN. Just...why. Even the collectible keycards aren't spared as you get warped back to that last save point. I ended up focusing on keycards only, the other more exploratory elements are relegated to a need-to-use basis as getting them again and crafting things again are just UGH. Fortunately this works for me as a veteran of stealth games as I get through conflicts via slipping by unnoticed, if you prefer some gunplay expect to suffer. I'd go so far to say as avoiding this game if you're of that disposition.

I would wish for extra save points, but as things are I employed the strategy of reusing the same save point repeatedly with some back and forth until I come across the next one."
555,3,0.5613,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Very well designed, a lot of attention paid to detail but I think it has been overhyped a lot.

It is ultimately quite repetitive, slow and frustrating with lots of backtracking, really predictable moments and often contrived situations:
Go from A > B > C > D, problem at D, go back to A, now go back to D but the door between A & B is broken (for some reason) so you will have to go via F > G > H > I instead. Coincidentally the alien is patrolling those areas. This happens a lot. It became so predictable I was able to tell people what would happen/what people would say in the next cutscene.

Towards the middle I just wanted it to end and the alien became a real nuisance rather than a monster. I stopped playing about 3/4 of the way through when I just basically became tired of the contrived inconveniences and watched the rest on youtube, I've never really done that before. The game definitely outstays it's welcome. 

If you enjoy atmospheric stealth games then buy it and give it a try, but only if it is on sale."
556,2,0.4305,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","I would balance my few hours of game time against a lifetime of playing PC games - beginning with actual floppy disks.

This game insulted me, my intelligence, my gaming experience - especially realizing where we are in history in terms of media achievement.

Alien Isolation is the gaming experience of lousy CGI which immediately removes one from the experience.

We can have beautiful visuals - but no jumping?

We can have beautiful musical homages to the original - but I cannot overcome a piece of upright luggage?

We can have the magical feel of low-tech space travel as a living possibility - but the story is devoid of logic?

As so many others who did not care for this game, I began with high expectations met - and surpassed in many instances; however, as the game went on I began to question the logic of the narrative, the gameplay and the universe until finally my big dumb brain called it and I turned it off not to play again.

I know that the game will not improve enough to overcome the issues in the beginning - or that at least it is not worth my time.

Big on visuals, dumb on logic.
Why are there are giant Alien style air vents RIGHT BY EVERY DOOR AND OPEN WHENEVER ANYTHING MOVES BY THEM?
How can one even have any kind of security in this situation?
Conversely, wouldn't any person who is wishing to secure an area be familiar with the ventilation system and they would check them instead of walking by?
Why is an attorney sent to travel through SPACE in a spacesuit?
In this universe, is travelling from a moving spaceship to a potentially dangerous space station in a spacesuit like driving a car for people?
How did this situation become so dire on a heavily-manned space station?
Wouldn't there be protocols so such a situation would not occur in a world where space travel and residence is so common there are welcoming signs in many languages in an airport terminal?
Why not choose a small, isolated mining facility, or a decommissioning, fringe military post?

I kept thinking ""they would have thought of this so that this rival factions bordering on cannibalism would not occur because they miss a few supply shipments and long-distance communications.""

Speaking of, how long has been since the event?
Wouldn't people ban together first against a common enemy, instead of splitting into factions?
Wouldn't it take people who were prior completely integrated into society, at least a few months if not at least six before they turned into murderous gangs bordering on cannibalism?
Otherwise, for the rest of humanity not to wonder what the hell happened in this time amount of time by attempting some form of communication or supply, wouldn't this have had to occur in a matter of weeks?
Why would people break down like this in a matter of weeks?

Regarding the Alien, if there is only one, I understand why it would be stalking and choosing its prey by striking from the shadows - but again, if there was just one, wouldn't normal, working people have first attempted to band together to kill just ONE Alien before devolving into murderous gangs?
So, is the one Alien who chased me into a subway which moved away at HIGH SPEEDS from the Alien, going to follow me somehow?
Does the Alien understand moving objects which are not alive and are programmed to halt at various selected destinations?
If so, does it push the button for the next train, wait until it arrives, then hop in the car and ride it to my destination?
Does it return in the same manner so it can drink a beer and watch the ball game?

Again, I actually did not play past this point, because my big dumb brain had so many questions, like, will this game will really try to sell me on ONE Alien stalking me across a space station so large that travel necessitates high-speed rail?
If so, why would it ignore all of the other humans around it?
Is this Alien upset at the Ripley bloodline like Jaws?

Okay fine, but then maybe there are MORE than one Alien and this is supposed to be some sort of Sixth Sense reveal, but if so...

Would civilians and some cops be able to withstand more than one Alien?
If they have already have broken down into rival factions, would one group of people be powerful enough to defeat Aliens?
If so, wouldn't more than one Alien overwhelm the humans fairly quickly, before they had a chance to break into rival factions?

I could not get over the idea that this many people in an otherwise normal universe situation (like no intergalactic wars or plagues) where they would be left stranded to breakdown into rival factions murdering for supplies.

I also could never get over the dumb gameplay.  I found it irritating in the nineties when a game character had to follow a set path because the designers used impediments such as luggage - but to see this in a AAA game in this day and age is absurd.
Try a little harder, in particular for the original purchase price.

Also, I read about how the game designers were crowing about the Alien AI, and how it is able to adjust to your tactics to stalk you; however, after reading other reviews, and determining the only answer of how a lone Alien could follow me clear to the other side of a space station - is that the Alien already KNOWS where the game character is.
This was a trope in old video games - that somehow the antagonist knows where the player is by seeing through walls. 
We found this irritating back in the day - but like the luggage as an impassable wall, we understood the limitations of the era.
This game simply does not have this excuse considering the expertise on display in other areas.
This was a CHOICE by the game designers.
They CHOOSE to insult gamers and their intelligence, experience, money and time.

I found it so stupid they rendered doors impassable by using a tool which would essentially render the tool and the door unusable.
Have they no locks in the future?
They sealed these doors so thoroughly with such an expenditure of irrecoverable resources that when I first became able to open these rooms I entered with caution because I believed they had locked something dangerous in there.
This was never the case, and it simply rendered it stupid that space-traveling people would do this.

Although I did not encounter any androids, I read they had all ""malfunctioned"" and were hostile towards people.
So ALL of the androids malfunctioned, and there are not any that continue to aid humans?

Again, if more than one Alien, and now an ARMY of malfunctioning androids are hostile to people, how did anyone survive in a manner and number different than Newt from Aliens?

The original android acted in the manner in which it did because it was ORDERED to by the company, and it ""malfunctioned"" because it had to directly act in direct contradiction to its prime directive to not harm humans.

This is essentially the Prometheus of video games - too many questions to answer satisfactorily, with too many direct, pandering insults in between the time it would take to get these answers anyway."

So, when I’ve read this was the best Alien game ever made and perfectly captures the spirit of the original Alien movie, my expectations skyrocketed. And it did start good. I was very impressed with the sound design. Visually, it’s equally impressive and the setting really feels like the original movie. However, the more you play it the more problems surface.

Alien: Isolation plays like Amnesia so at its core it’s a hide and seek game. However, it is at least 10 hours too long and it starts feeling extremely repetitive after a while. The level design doesn’t change, you are expected to do the same things over and over in prolonged corridors, plenty of backtracking and unfair difficulty. I liked it the first few hours, but it did not hold my attention for long to the point I have decided to call it quits. 

I can’t really recommend Alien: Isolation. And I believe the best alien game award still belongs to Aliens vs Predator 2.

The retro-style computers and chairs make you feel like a kid at the airport in the early 80s. The androids' design, stolen from an old movie is extremely creepy and sets the mood.

Unfortunately the rest of the game is pretty boring unless you're a hardcore fan of penumbra-style games.
You spend your time being coralled from cinematic to QTE to scripted encounter, and repeat. 
I mean, I know that the same in most games, but here you really feel the artificial lack of freedom.
The only free-form gameplay consists mostly of heavily scripted stealth sequences where you have to slowly crawl through levels, praying that the enemies' erratic AI will not send them straight toward you, because the game uses save points and they're always located very far from where the action takes place. Most of the time the alien just moves his patrols from the previous zone to the one you're currently in, forcing you to endlessly hide and wait for it to pass by, it's very repetitive.

A game is supposed to be somewhat fun, or at least interesting. Here it's just tedious and feels like work. Everything is there to be tedious. For a game where you spend most of your time moving stealthily the controls never cease to be clunky and irritating.

I won't dwell on the scenario. It starts from the insulting premise that Ripley's daughter is going through exactly the same things that her mom. You know a franchise is tired when they can't even come up with new characters unrelated to the old ones.
Nothing is very believable, and the station inhabitants act really stupid. It feels like a syfy ripoff of an alien movie, although I'll admit some of the movies in the alien franchise have worst story than this game.


The game is constantly trying to set a stressing ambiance with some blaring music cues that gets old very fast.

564,3,0.5757,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Alien: Isolation is probably the best horror game ever made.

It really is an incredibly tense game where death comes quickly and easily. Your weapons are useless against most enemies. The most you can do is distract or stun them. This means there's a whole lot of sneaking and crawling and hiding and hoping they don't path toward you. 
Bucking the trend of many games, your senses are crippled. This is all first person. There is no wall hacks to look around a corner; you are literally going to have to peak. Your handheld motion scanner is the closest you'll get to a wall hack and it makes a loud beeping noise that might just get you caught. Your aim is trash, your reload time is abysmal, and your melee hits mostly just give a really nice massage. 

Graphically it's not amazing, textures are poor but facial animations are excellent. But what this game nails is the audio. From an atmosphere standpoint this game oozes aesthetic. The creaks and groans of the space station, to the positional audio clues of where the alien is stomping. You need audio not just for the immersion but to know where it's safe to walk. 
The story is simple, not overdone, and very effective. Much of this comes down to excellent voice acting, and they've done a stunning job nailing the retro 80s sci-fi complete with green computer monitors and blocky texts.

I have nothing I can objectively say bad about Alien: Isolation, except once thing: I didn't enjoy playing it. I have avoided this genre and I secretly hoped that maybe it would change my mind. Amnesia : Dark Descent, Outlast, etc. are not the kind of experience I would typically enjoy. I love a good, dark, moody, atmosphere, but I also don't like getting PTSD.

I notched this game down to Easy, and that was enough for my fragile nerves to take. I stopped playing at the Medical Bay. I wouldn't say I enjoyed Alien:Isolation as much as I experienced. It is exhausting, and I'm sure there are many people who avoid these games for that reason. I had hoped Alien Isolation would change my mind about the genre but it didn't. If you're hoping the IP or budget will change your mind about this genre I don't think it will. As strange as this is going to sounds, I don't recommend Alien: Isolation for people who avoid this genre, but nor would I change a thing about it."

You then have to redo everything you already did, which is boring, so you do it faster than the first time, which leads to the alien finding and killing you again. Rinse and repeat.

rest of the game was just awful for me - boring and repetitive chores (switch that on, switch the other off, turn the power up, turn the other off), often too vague intructions (f.e. find memory cell - ok, but is it big or small? is it red, green or yellow? is it mechanical or electonic thingy?), completely linear gameplay and it was dragging on and on and on... when I reached the missions to overload cores I was completely fed up and when I read that there are 5 more missions just said ""f*ck that, it's not worth it""

I'm not sure if it's because I was playing on 'Hard' difficulty, but it was more annoying than challenging, really.

Imagine my surprise discovering how boring and frustrating this game is. Unfortunately suspension of disbelief didn't work for bunch of reasons. Sevastopol station is the biggest  piece of junk in the universe. For the majority of time I was crawling in the shadows with the scanner back and forth (fucking metroidvania!) to press some buttons, fun as hell. Nothing worked properly, alien must chewed some wires or something. There were also some glitches and things to a greater or lesser extent illogical or stupid. For some reason I couldn't ignore most of this details, such as flashlight batteries, they work for less than 4 minutes (wow, space engineering). But the biggest problem is, this game isn't scary. Androids who trail behind Ripley like toilet paper was rather irritating. And the star of this show - alien our stalker... meh. Always somewhere near, I get used to him pretty fast because he showed up too many times to end my ""fascinatig"" jurney . When I know what to expect and game constantly remind me that it's just a game, is no longer scary.

Here I will mention several good things about this game (to everything we should approach in objective way, right?), don't worry as you can see this section is short. First of all I found out how it feels to be a snail. Besides there's no rats (it's always a good thing!), alien has shiny teeth and remember - in space, no one can hear your scream. Well, of course except people, androids, facehuggers and aliens. Uh, Sevastopol is a pretty crowded place so you won't feel lonely.

The worst thing, the first time I wasn't even sloppy, the atmosphere is great and made me sneak the whole time.

After this the game was no longer the same or fun. You just watch every vent hoping it would not randomly spawn next to you again. And then a few levels later the alien spawned where I could clearly see it and I had to go. It walked back and forth, but never left.

If I have to resort to actual speedrun strats in order not to get frustrated - you have a problem. And that problem is the AI of the xeno itself - not the behavioral, mind you, but rather the so-called ""director"" AI system. It sounds brilliant on paper, but sucks in gameplay terms. When you have to hide in lockers every 30 seconds for nearly 2 minutes, yawning and just waiting for the ayy to get back into the vent so you can continue the staple meaningless busywork, it takes away every single scary thing this game has going for it for good. Also, instant death is a haram idea. To any and every horror game maker out there: hit-and run tactics to send people into panic-fueled overdrive as a crescendo to tension-building are the way to go. Leave the player with a tiny sliver of health and the foe still around and watch the show. 
(In case of doubt, look up Subnautica, a game that really isn't in the genre, but does dangerous foes really well.)

On a different note: 
It's kinda sad the the best Alien piece of media since the original 2 movies (and AvP) ibeing so boring and frustrating while remaining inasnely accurate to the franchise itself in so many in-universe details it makes my head hurt and spin simultaenously. It was made with a lot of passion and served to a nearly starved-out fanbase, but then someone really thought watching the inside of a locker is scary. 

Lots of people do so, apparently, judging by the reviews, so - hey - you may actually enjoy it. Statistics seem to be in your favor here. To me, personally, a game ain't worth much if the gameplay - you know, the main idea behind an interactive medium - just infuriates you all the time."

588,3,0.639,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I had initially given this game a fairly positive review, but the latter half of this game almost makes the whole thing void of enjoyment. 

The positive aspects:
The Xenomorph and all the time and care that went into programming this behavior was outstanding and truly the shining pinnacle of this game.  I am very impressed, especially when learning about how it actually works and reacts to the player's actions. I wish more AI would utilize these types of efforts.

The established atmosphere of the game lends to a very unsettling, constant feeling of dread, and true to its name, isolation. The music and sounds also add a great deal of emotion and tension,

Fans of the Alien series no doubt love the aesthetic and feel of this game, as it tries to replicate the first film and evidently does really well with that.


The negatives:
Unfortunately, despite all of the positives listed above, while they are very strong and enough to keep me playing, there are such large chunks of this game I really don't like. The Working Joes are another type of enemy in this game, and unfortunately they are utilized so often. They are overused, uninteresting, frustrating, and detract from the Xenomorph. I suspect they, along with human enemies, were dispatched so you wouldn't grow tired of facing the alien all the time, but the AI behind these enemies isn't nearly as thought through, and in my opinion, you wouldn't need to worry about rotating enemies out if you cut down the length of the game. The backtrack on some levels could have easily been reduced, in addition to very arbitrary gameplay moments that don't really mean anything in the grand scheme of the levels, they're just another wrench thrown into the works. 

I can't speak much to the crafting, I think some of the items are useful, but most get you into more trouble than they're worth. 

I played a mix of hard and normal difficulty settings, and I do think the nightmare difficulty would be fun with regards to the alien, but even just thinking about replaying all the areas with the Working Joes makes me never want to. 

In short: I would recommend this game as worth playing when it involves moments with the Xenomorph, and if you're a fan of the original Alien film, as I think you would enjoy playing in that universe, especially if you're invested in the Ripleys, but I wouldn't recommend anything else about it.

589,3,0.5348,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This game has a beautiful and intriguing space station environment and is quite scary/challenging on hard. However, the controls could use some serious work. The radial menu is pretty cumbersome, and it's really annoying how you don't automatically reload your weapons. Also, it can be pretty hard to select things with your cursor at times, which is really annoying. 

There are a couple bugs:

-sometimes your flashlight says it's out of batteries when you have a bunch of them.

-this only happened once even though i've played around 15 hours, but there is this bug where your ability to rotate with your cursor is lost, and the only way to reset it is to exit the game.

The game starts out really laid back and easy, but at around chapter 3 or 4, you have to put a lot of effort into avoiding getting eaten by the alien. A lot of the time you can't even avoid it, definitely a good game for people looking for a somewhat frustrating challenge. Even when I turned the difficulty down to medium for one part i was having serious problems with, it was still difficult. EDIT: having beat this game, i have to say it's pretty stunning overall and addictive, but...

Given all the problems with the PC version of this game, I would not recommend paying the full price for it, i got this at about a 75% discount and that's a helluva bargain for this much gameplay. I'd say if you give this game a chance despite it's faults, you will get many hours of out of this, I have yet to try survivor mode."

591,3,0.6323,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","[h1]I really wanted to like it, but the pacing is an issue.[/h1]
Having played other similarly-styled games such as Amnesia, Outlast, Penumbra, and several others, I knew what I was getting into with Alien Isolation. Despite really wanting to like it, I eventually had to put the game down, unable to finish it. In saying that, however, there were plenty of things I really liked about the game, namely:

- The atmosphere: The graphics, sound design, and environment design make for a very convincing experience. The first couple of hours were spent in complete fear of what was lurking around the corner. The size and complexity of some of the levels meant that often times I would get lost without a complete map, making for a very tense experience.
- The mechanics: There is so much to love in this respect. First off, hiding is no longer a guaranteed strategy, and sometimes I found it better to try and manoeuvre my way around enemies rather than hide from them. Also, the movement scanner was probably one of my favourite bits of equipment in the whole game, and watching enemies move closer and closer whilst I was hiding in a locker was definitely a horrifying experience.

What I didn't like:
- The pacing: This was one of the biggest issues for me. Most of the objectives fall under the 'hunter/gatherer' type, which is to say most of the game is spent collecting items for some banal objective. Had it not been for the horribly slow pacing of the game, I actually wouldn't have minded this.
- The alien: Being the clear centrepiece of the game, I was disappointed to find that it became pretty easy to predict what it was going to do, which removed practically all tension from the game.
- The hacking puzzles: In the beginning these were pretty quirky and fun, but because they don't increase in difficulty all that much, they end up getting in the way and becoming more annoying than anything."

I do not consider myself a BIG fan from the ALIEN saga, but I have seen the films and at least I can say that I have some affection for the universe. That is why I started this game with high hopes… however…

The game starts fresh, and you will feel like you were in the first film. The ship is huge and has a lot of attention to details, and the graphics are good too (even for a game like this, which is a little bit old, you would enjoy the graphics and the design). The first mission, which serves like a tutorial, is very good. But just when the game seems to “start”, everything starts to fall apart.

First, the number of other humans on the ship. This does not make sense, maybe a few survivors could cope with the Alien threat, but organized groups? Also, all these humans seem to be perfect killing machines: they will easily spot you, and with a few shots you will die. This wouldn’t be an issue if you could properly defend yourself, but your character moves slow, does not know how to gunfight… so in the end you have to sneak the enemies, with a lot of care (because, as I said, a few shots will take you down), and take them down with your melee weapon… all and all, ok, I can deal with this issue as long as the Alien is better implemented…

Well, the Alien is even worse. Don’t misunderstand me, the first time it appears, it looks cool, frightening, and you will have a hard time completing the mission where the Alien will constantly follow you, just to finish it and say: “Ok, that was all for the moment…”. Not really! The Alien will be following you ALWAYS, and this leads to several problems. The first one being that this does not feel right from a canon point of view. You will start to feel that the Alien is just a “moving instakill”, not really a stealthy assassin. I understand that if you are going nuts and firing shots with your revolver to everyone the Alien should appear and teach you a lesson, but what’s the point of having the Alien always walking around the level? Even if you hide for half an hour the Alien will not disappear like: “well, nothing to do here” … no, it will always be near you. So in the end you are constantly dying, because there is no way to deal with the Alien (I know that as you proceed you discover a flamethrower, but what’s the point?). I can think of a few ways in which the Alien could be better implemented, and no way it could be worse implemented. The stealth system is not good, you will have to repeat several sections of the game when the Alien kills you… boring.

Finally, the gameplay is very basic and very uninteresting. You will always go and push a button, open a lever… so boring after a few hours if I have to be honest. When I completed the fifth mission of this game, and the achievement popped up, I saw that only 30% of the people had the achievement… which I believe really speaks for itself. The first glimpse of this game is very good, but it soon becomes a boring and tedious experience. I would only recommend this game if you REALLY love the ALIEN franchise and you don’t mind putting your time into a game where you will be constantly walking and crouching, with very poor mechanics on, more or less, the rest of the game."

Alas the game fails at its most important part: Immersion 
I have owned this game for 6 years now.  I tried 4 times, currently debating if I should stop the 4th try. 

It is not that I’m new to slow sneaky games. I have played the heck out of the Thief series for example or one of the sneakier alien vs predator games and I loved it.

From the ever persistent feeling that it is a console game to the in your face text “press X to climb” in the middle of a dark air vent this game could not manage to grab my attention and immersion.

I couldn't care about the companions which name I hardly remember, I think Samuel was one, because I never do much with them. The first companion I cared a little, because he was there and somewhat in the same situation got killed instantly. 

People, people everywhere. For a claustrophobic all alone in space feeling the station should be almost empty. But heck I run into people all the time, that means my chances of running into the ONE alien on that station should be minimal….. (spoiler it is not the alien follows you around like a dog) 

But before that it felt like ages until you encounter the alien the first time…. And when you do THEY TAKE THE CONTROL AWAY FROM YOU AND PLAY A SCRIPTED EVENT. How fing unimmersive 


Then there is the perfectly fine spaceship floating around that should be able to pic me up without a big hassle.

The alien feels more like an actor in a suit than a feral space predator. I mean neatly opening lockers ??? why? Just let it bash in the door until you die. 

Oh and the locker system, man do I hate it. press KEY for a chance to avoid the threat. It's so damn unimmersive. To be immersive you need to use the environment hide behind boxes  tables corners etc. There is a little bit of that but somehow it feels very unpolished and inorganic sometimes they see/hear you from miles away and sometimes they stand right next to you in line of sight but cannot find you.

And I’m not even talking about that you can shoot the synthetics in the head or foot and nothing happens they just keep on walking, they flinch, but after a whole mag into their right leg the thing still looks like new and the guy walks just fine. 

Also the fricking mini games are an insult to your intelligence and totally killed immersion for me. On the PC you also have to guess what they mean by moving keys, because sometimes it is WASD other times the arrow keys are meant.

And in the end there are floating eyes and gadgets the tiny steps you are unable to get on to, the tables and boxes that are unmanageable blockages like you are glued to the floor, that just ruin the last bit of immersion there ever was.

I’m really saddened that I couldn’t love this game.


Epilogue: After I installed the ""unpredictable alien"" mod the game was actually kinda nice. Until the alien caught me crouching between two bunk beds and couldn’t path 1m to the side to have a straight line at me. Constantly running into the bed like an idiot with me bursting out laughing. Uninstalled probably never try again.  This game was less scary than mining a block under you high up in the sky in minecraft :P lmao"

Figuring out where to go next SHOULDN'T BE INSCRUTABLE. If I wanted a map simulator, I'd join the boy scouts. Opening a hatch shouldn't force me to watch a 20 second animation EVERY time. Also, filling the game with superhuman androids who catch your weapon and are hard to kill without guns didn't make it fun; it made it damned annoying.
They're added all manner of ""puzzle"" games (door locks, security systems, etc) but they quickly become a repetitious impediment.
Limiting your save opportunities (why the hell does it take so long to START the save?) is one way of adding a sense of danger, but having repeated the same section a dozen times, the sense of danger simply turns into irritation. I've taken 5 hours to complete 30 minutes worth of game play.
Also, the limited saves, completely unforgiving enemies and CONSTANT alarm sounds are antithetical to the exploration that would enable me to really bask in this game's authentic alien atmosphere. The environment is believable as part of of the grunge tech world of Alien, but only at the absolute beginning did I feel relaxed enough to actually appreciate it.
And did I mention, I HATE games that don't let me save often, preferably when I want to?

Disclaimer: This review is based on a mixture of a new release price tag, and all of the flase things that Creative Assembly was boasting. (surprise surprise)

This game is beautiful. The sound and music are also on point. It's a very immersive environment that explores more of the Alien universe lore. I remembered watching the movie Aliens and wanting them to expand on Ripley's daughters life while she was in cryo-sleep. Decent crafting, and enough gadgets and weapons to get you by. Please note, this is not a run and gun first person shooter like the millenials keep wanting reskinned versions to play. This is more like Outlast or Prenumbra set in the Alien universe. Do not run in shooting everywhere or you will die. It's a survival game, not a hop around firing rocket launchers game.

Now the bad. I can't stress enough, I got it yesterday, and was having fun with it the first few hours. However, I began noticing things. CA boasted that the alien possessed super duper state of the art artificial AI, (sound like another game they released last year?) but the alien actually spawns and teleports around the map near your vicinity. I've found myself hiding from him in a locker, and he just roams around the room, or the halls outside so you eventually have to get out of the locker and let him get you so you can reload your save and try again, and after reloading he's nowhere to be found.

There was one point where I was moving down a corridor, and there were 3 open ceiling vents above, and you can tell where he's at because you see a stream of drool dripping down onto the floor. I skirted around said vent so he couldn't grabe me, and guess what? The rain of drool immediately appeared in the 2nd, and then 3rd vent after that. These vents were not connected to each other, so how did he immediatly appear in the next one? If he knew where I was, why didn't he just drop down and kill me? (You can't outrun him if he sees you) Again, his ""A.I."" doesn't seem intelligent, just random spawning and cheap kills.

I've watched him spot me from down the hall, run after me, and I made it into a room and hid in the locker. He was RIGHT behind me at this point but once the locker door closed, he just turned and walked out.

I've seen him walk past a human NPC that wasn't even sneaking and continue searching for me while I was hiding under a desk. Neither him nor the NPC acknoweledge one anothers presence.

I have rarely felt like I've been outsmarted by this sophisticated A.I.. It mainly feels random and cheap when he finds me.

The human enemy A.I. is just a series of talking to each other and patrolling a set path while having predator like vision that can spot you crouching in the dark from 100 meters away and snipe you with a pistol somehow.

A challenging game doesn't bother me, but I'm 34 and been a gamer for 29 years ever since my parents bought me my first NES. I can tell the difference between a challenging game and just random good/bad luck.

Overall, the lore so far seems good, and the visuals are stunning, but I really wish modern game developers would focus on gameplay as opposed to flashy graphics to hold the attention of ritalin addled kids.

It's worth getting, but I'd wait until it's 20-30 dollars because I don't think it will be worth more than a 1 time playthrough."

This results in having to spend hours sneaking about, covering loads of miles to get all your never ending extra things to allow you to do the one thing you set out to do, only to be either got by the Alien or killed by any of the other hostiles, so having to replay the whole damned level again and again! Why? Because the frigging save stations are few and far between, so unless you backtrack miles past all the hostiles you avoided on the way through, each time you get another item, you have no choice but to commit to push on and if you're unlucky you lose ALL that progress, which is bad enough, but then you have to do it all again, which is HUGELY trime consuming! Also it gets boring too.
Shame really because it could be quite a good game if it weren't for that stupid design flaw."

The combat (actually - there is none) against the Alien (pretty sure there is only one) is a complete departure from any movie or game in the franchise (prepare to $uc#!) but for some reason you have to kill every single person you come in contact with because they are also the enemy - so, 1st stupid question.... why? I feel like i'm allowing nature to live freely on the station but required to exterminate my own species - just waiting for the Alien to start cheering me on - Go Ripley Go!!

I know its creative option to say Ripleys daughter is alive - maybe Berk lied to her so shed be committed to his mission. But heres what is bugging me - she apparently has an aptitude in repairs or mechanical tendencies (and apparently she is afraid to pilot) but she is so fearful of the aliens she freezes up around them (based on opening sequence) BUT absolutely, has no issue with beating and killing the crap out of people - if i met a girl like that, i'd run far away, as fast as i could. 

Lastly, she is trying to figure out what happened to her mother - apparently lied to and strung a long by the company - her character seems to be weak, naive and frankly, just plan stupid.... lacking all the qualities of her mother - bet her dad was a total waste nut!!

You start the game off walking, during the game, you walk. In the end...you walk. Prepare for tons of damn walking. The game isn't scary, more annoying than anything. The sound glitches occasionally, pipe bomb, reloading, Samual's voice, and death by Alien. 

Amanda is an Engineer, we get that. She also only ever turns on power via generator or terminal, that's your focus, crawl, walk, and hide while trying to turn on  power.

If I hide, I just have to sit and wait a really long time and hope it's gone away.

636,1,0.32,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I originally started playing A:I in VR but due to some strange bugs I could not continue playing in VR. Bummer, but it is what it is.

The sheer amount of bugs I ran into while playing this game was astounding; I ran into at least 3 a night and some of them were game breaking. I'll list a few of the ones that I can remember off the top of my head:

* Changing keybindings (no matter the key or what it binds to) always changed the forward (W) key after you saved the bindings.

     ** I decided to try controller since I couldn't' rebind my keys properly but controller support doesn't support all the abilities you have -.-

* Hostile Working Joe's that just stare at a wall and leave you alone... Unless you enter a locker next to them then they rip you out and choke you out until you free yourself and then they leave you alone again. Also, that Joe was unkillable.

* Alien in vent animations and sounds will be showing/playing but you can literally be staring at the xenomorph (we called her Karen) in a different area of the room.

     ** Going off of that: if you get to an overhead vent where Karen is but the animations or sounds haven't started yet she will still kill you...

* The clipping of throwable items is TERRRRRIBLE! The invisible hit box of items and areas are massive so you'll constantly be hitting them and your item will go careening either back into your face or so somewhere else completely different than you intended.

* Noise makers not doing anything. I'd throw a noise maker to bait out Karen (I know she was there because of the motion tracker) and she just wouldn't show up?

* Not a bug, per se, but annoying: Karen will 1000% run THROUGH other humans to go kill you instead (I guess just like an IRL Karen at a grocery store...) Sure, you are the player so you are what really matters but come ON!

There are more but I cannot recall them off the top of my head while writing this review. I'll update it later if I think of more.

Beyond the bugs, if you do not enjoy ""stealth"" play I don't think you will enjoy this game. You can literally be locked in a locker for 10+ minutes waiting for the freaking patrols to ""de-hostilize"" as they just circle the room you are in. Drove me insane where I would eventually just go YOLO and take a chance just so I wouldn't be stuck there staring at the screen any longer. No joke, I would take out my phone and scroll through social media apps for the patrols to finally go away...

Also, the unexplained ""difficulty"" changes were obnoxious. Like, [spoiler]why suddenly normal Working Joe's suddenly started taking more shots than they used to without any rhyme or reason [/spoiler] is just bad game design.

Another bad design is you are forced to use your items in a couple cases to ""balance upcoming difficulty by making sure you haven't hoarded resources""... As a resource and item hoarder, I prefer to play through low resource games by using them as little as possible and keeping them for ""dire"" moments. There are parts of this game where you literally cannot progress without using a bunch of items and resources as a cheap way to make the upcoming bits more difficult because you are low on resources... They already limit your inventory so this gameplay idea just felt cheap. Also, the items are randomized in the game so getting the resources you need is a crapshoot and if you happen to fully run out of [spoiler]flamethrower juice at the end where Karen is on you 100% of the time[/spoiler] you are going to have a bad time...

I think I ended up getting more frustrated than scared at this game and I am very easily scared. So take that as you will. The idea of the game is cool but I just feel it was poorly executed.

This game isn't fun. There's about 8 hours of actual content in this game that's fluffed up to nearly 30 hours (I played a bit offline) of ""gameplay"" that's mostly consisted of you redoing the same things over and over and over and over again. Here's what you'll do if you play this game:

-Pull 300 levers
-Press 100 switches
-Activate 40 generators
-Restore power 20 times
-Die 800 times (forcing you to restart 20 minutes prior, making you REDO THESE BULLET POINTS EVEN MORE)
-Hide inside things, not doing anything, for at least 6 hours. 
-[spoiler]Kill the alien 0 times [/spoiler]
-Enable elevators/tramways 75 times
-Have maybe 3 hours of collective fun

So, playing this game 6 years after launch, I will say the Alien is the best part of the game. Unfortunately, it is really the only good part. 

For starters, the Xenomorph is the antagonist for only about 1/2 of the game. The rest of the time, you are fighting and hiding from raiders and rogue AIs, both of which are boring and frustrating to come across. They do not present the same amount of scare factor nor threat, and basically all parts that they are present are dull and annoying.

Contrarily, the Alien itself, is very fucking terrifying. The highlights of the game are entirely made up of when it is hunting you. However, I do not think that the Alien is ""that"" intelligent; there are certainly patterns to its AI which you can learn and memorize to exploit. There are also items you can find or craft that make encounters with the Alien significantly easier, especially the flamethrower, which makes the game almost too easy. This unbalance makes the game too difficult in the beginning and too easy later on in the game.

Some other complaints are that the sense of direction can be awful at certain points, and the ending was very unrewarding for a game I just played for 15 hours.

As an example, the androids take 6 shots TO THE HEAD to take down one.
Humans are only slightly less of a bullet sponge.

You can't carry much ammo and that's a vast understatement.
the pistol you find is a six shot and you get a total of two reloads.

You can make a variety of devices in the base game, but using them is rather pointless if you have ammo for your guns.
They also have an incredibly small limit on the number you can carry (two).

The game mechanics are ANNOYING and generally detract from the overall experience.
Ideally you should be able to either sneak or go rambo depending on what YOU want... but this game just doesn't let you do the latter until vastly later in the game.
I also required a mod to get enough ammo and devices to not quit playing the game.

The WORST thing about this game is that the developers made the alien outright cheat.
I found this most obvious when going through the medical labs.
You MUST hide from the alien many many times to get the things you need and get out, but after dying a couple times I notice the alien is now AUTOMATICALLY finding me.
They set it up so that the alien knows where you are every time you hide somewhere and it gets worse over time.

I also noticed that even if you succeed in avoiding the alien inspection and wait until it is 2 hallways away, it AUTO TELEPORTS back to the locker and does the kill sequence as soon as you let go of the avoid key.

Overall it's not worth buying at full price; however it is worth getting on sale and using the Improved Alien and Softcore Mod, mods.

666,1,0.4246,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Well-made game, but it didn't work for me.

It's a stealth action game, with heavy emphasis on stealth.  If you're familiar with Dishonored, imagine you're playing a ""no powers"" run, half the guards can't be subdued and won't go down without multiple shots to the head, and instead of zipping across the rooftops you're crawling through air ducts.  On top of that, there's an invincible Alien that shows up occasionally and chases you around; if it finds you, you die.  (I understand your ability to disable Androids and scare off the Alien improves later in the game... didn't get that far.)  If the Alien is actively hunting you, and you stay in the same place, you will eventually be caught, so you can't just wait things out.

So the patience and observation that are the hallmark of other stealth games are partly replaced by frantic low-speed ducking and fleeing.  I don't think I've ever been so tense playing a video game.  It's really well done.  I managed to get the ""Just out of Reach"" achievement, and felt like I earned it (and aged about 6 months).

There is one ragequit-inducing feature: the save-game mechanism.  To save your game you have to get to one of the save terminals and activate it, which takes a few seconds.  They are spread fairly far apart.  If the Alien is stalking around right next to it, you're not going to be able to save your game there.  So you continue through the level until the Alien eats you, and the last 15 minutes of patient progress and exploration gets thrown away.  This adds consequence to an already tense experience.

In the end I found that I wasn't looking forward to playing it so much as I was dreading it.  This is a testament to the effectiveness of the game design, but also a sign that I should play something else.

I played on hard, but would actually recommend people play on easy to minimize the xenomorph occurrences. I suspect the tension would probably work better if you only saw the alien occasionally. Having to hide from it all the time just leads to a lot of waiting, which desensitizes you to the threat. People really talked up the xenomoph AI, but like with Outlast, it amounts to hiding, waiting, rinse and repeat, which is neither fun nor scary after the nth time. I didn't feel like the alien was particularly clever or even all that hostile.

Someone who was a big fan of the films (I like the first one) might want to play it some, but the gameplay and ending isn't worth going through all of it."

671,3,0.4392,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","No. Just No. Sorry, I'm really sorry to everyone who loves this game, I just cannot get into it. The game caters to a very specific kind of gamer and gameplay. The game wants you to play it in a very specific way, almost like an 'On rails' experience without the rails. You're only going to be progressing and playing the game in one way only (sneaking around). There is no experimentation, no alternate paths, it has very basic emergent gameplay.

An example is when you first encounter some hostile survivors. Like many others, I managed to bash to death one who was holding a revolver. 'Awesome' I thought, NOW i can level the playing field and use this revolver to pop them and move on.... ""Hmmmm"" I thought, somethings wrong, i just cant seem to pickup this revolver, ""Ah well, I'll just reload the game, surely its some minor bug"". 

WRONG! The game specifically doesn't let you pickup the weapon, it completely ruined the atmosphere, totally throwing me out of the game (mentally). I was so confused, why not just let me pick it up and shoot the remaining 3-4 rounds left in it? NOPE not allowed, they only want you to get the pistol when you ""find it"" in some office somewhere. So disappointing :(

Pros:
-Looks awesome, they nailed the aesthetic perfectly. All the details, the wonky 80's tech, the atmosphere is brilliant, cannot stress this enough.
-The Alien is fucking scary, way way waaaay spooky, looks great and has enough smarts to stay interesting.
-Crafting has an interesting system behind it, I enjoyed some of the crafting options.
-I liked the save system (lots of people hate it) but in conjunction with the back tracking and button hitting and I can see why people don't like it.

Cons:
-The gameplay is shit, there I said it. I'm sorry again lots of people love this game but it's like a cool stealth section in a normal game stretched out to be 14 hours long. You are basically sneaking around, hitting switches and backtracking to hit more switches to open up another area full of switches, buttons and generators. It's just not interesting enough, its flawed and it goes on and on and on.
-The Ai survivors are stupid and have little impact on anything, they are just another obstacle for you. 
-Gun play is poor (granted it's not supposed to be a major part of the game anyway).
-They've gotten the balance totally off in terms of stealth and action, the game is almost 95% sneaking around, there is very little ""action"" very little to break up the monotony of the stealth. 

No I'm not looking for COD action, No I'm not wanting explosions and gunfire to be going off every minute. But honestly the game has focused far to much on stealth and button pressing and backtracking.
It truly is survival horror which from a gameplay perspective gets so tedious and boring after the first 3-4 hours I cannot enjoy it and cannot finish the game."

They make the alien ridiculously invincible.  Shot gun blasts don't stop it.  They let the thing survive in outer space.  And jump around as if there's gravity.

It's an endless game of chasing the mouse.

Perhaps there's multiple ways of solving the game but it seemed pretty linear.  Which is fine but it's odd that you get a final upgrade for a component when there's no use for it.

Before I make my next statement, let me just say that I usually crank most modern games to the hardest difficulty setting immediately.  I don't want route markers, I want the hardest challenge possible, I don't want hints.  But I left this game at the normal difficult setting because I wasn't sure what I was getting into yet.

If you do try to play this, know that you rarely need to back track. If you just unlocked a door, and don't see anything there, then you're missing something.

Pros and Cons are fairly balanced, however there's one thing that makes me not recommending the game. It cannot be recommended as survival horror game. It's scary for first hour, because we expect it to be scary, it's dark, there are disturbing noises, there are piles of people in plastic bags and area seems to be abandoned. Place ruled by ultimate predator one may think. But as soon as Alien actually appears it's not scary anymore. 

It's basically programmed to orbit around the player so i got used to it presence very quickly, but also the way it's designed as an enemy doesn't make it scary. Because it's dumb. It's always following your footsteps, but you can go circles with him around the coffee table and remain undetected. When Alien gets bored, it jumps into vent in the ceiling, spawns in random, remote spot and slowly goes towards you. Again and again. You have motion tracker to determine where it is all the time, but it's footsteps are also very loud.

There are maybe two moments in the game when it's scripted to appear just in front of you, when you expect it to be somewhere else. Other than that it's always behind you, walking blindly between the spots you were few minutes ago. So there's no fear about encountering anything scary in long dark hallway in front of you, behind that door, in that vent, on top of that ladder, etc. Because alien is - lemme quickly 180 and check my motion tracker - yes, somewhere behind you so you just keep on following your objective (because there's also path finder in said motion tracker).

Alien is an obstacle, rather annoying because of it's homing ability. Sometimes I've been going rounds and rounds around the pool table, because Alien was obsessed to stay in the room where i had to flip that lever and hack that device to go further.

Story isn't the strong point either, after half of the game it feels forced and it once again tries to wrap around all the same elements other games and movie trilogy had. Sadly it feels artificial, it's just too much for one game and at some point time between major catastrophic events literally shrinks to minutes. 

Really, really strong part is graphics, it's simple the best across all alien games. Not just for it's realistic quality, but for aesthetics, which matches first alien movie 100% accurately. Space station has this good, industrial vibe, and when it's seen from the outside it's just breath taking.

Because the game is so poor in its substance, this gets really tedious and frustrating. The story just keeps dragging on and on, especially towards the end, when there's really no reason to anymore.

Even more sadly, the mystery and magic of the Alien is lost very quickly thanks to its frequent appearances, and predictable AI. With the flamethrower in your arsenal its presence becomes more of a nuisance, rather than a scary monster to avoid at all costs.

I've ghosted all the Thief games, done most of the Hitman missions master/suit only/silent assassin.  This is not a well made stealth game.  It's more just annoying beyond belief than anything else.  A well made stealth game requires that the player have the ability to hide from guards in order to observe their behavior and devise a strategy to avoid them including use of distraction devices that actually distract the guards.  It may take very careful observation and perfect timing, but it should be possible to plan and execute a strategy that gets you through untouched.  And if the player's plan goes awry, the player should probably have some means of escaping.  

Alien Isolation doesn't do any of that.  The main 'guard' -- the Alien -- can't be hidden from in any effective way.  It will inevitably find you in about 30 seconds if you try to hide under a desk or in a cabinet.  It has no patterns that can be observed and worked around.  Instead, it usually pops out in a highly scripted way to get in the player's way when a specific task has to be accomplished, always knowing exactly where the player is no matter how quiet they've been.  There are no useful tools for restoring a low alert state once the scripting has decided the Alien should be on high alert because you are at an important plot point (you can burn the Alien, but all that makes it do is disappear for like 10 seconds before coming back and knowing exactly where you are).  Various tools -- noisemakers, smoke grenades, flares -- are useless, because as soon as you use them, the Alien (or android or human) is automatically put on high alert with exact knowledge of where you are and will remain on permanent high alert until it kills you.  Basically you just need to be very lucky to avoid it.  There's no skill involved, just a lot of reloading   That is not how you make a quality stealth game."

Amazing graphics, truthfull with source material.
Ambience and atmosphere of the game outstanding.
You really feel you're inside the first movie, every texture and model very well done.

Synthetics, they scare more than the actual alien.
Flamethrower.

The bad:
Player control is ok, but the general gameplay is really boring and annoying.
After a while the Alien doesnt scare you anymore, and except the flamthrower (wich you get almost ending the game) nothing is really usefull against the Alien, so you spend 30 mins hidden without moving waiting for the Alien to go away.
Walk 5 mins, then wait 30 mins the alien go away, and so on.

Player doesnt have any chance of escaping the Alien (except flamthrower), once you've been spotted your dead. No other tool/grande is usefull against the alien.

Flash granade: useless / only synthetics
Smoke granade: useless  / only synthetics
Noise maker granade: This distracts alien for 1 sec or 2, but trying to hide while crouching (very slow) doesnt give you enough time.
EMP granade/mine: useless  / only synthetics
Molotov: Oh god, this is the ONLY granade that actually DO something, it scares the alien away, also it does a lot of damage to synthetics
Pipe bomb: This one does hurt the alien, but it takes a while until it explodes and more often than not the Alien walks away without getting hurt, pipe explode making Alien aware so... Used as last resort only.
Stun baton: useless / only for synths
Revolver: useless / only for synths
Shotgun: useless / only for synths
Boltgun: useless / only for synths
Flare: ¬¬ ... useless on the entire game
Flamethrower: the only real weapon that DOES something to avoid the alien (it scares the alien away)

Conclusion:
Sadly I can't recommend this game despite the art department that had made an incredible work on visuals.
Game is annoying and boring, its not about stealth or strategy. 
As I said, hide in locker or below something wait 30 mins until Alien goes away. Walk 5 mins (Alien actually appears every 5 or 10 mins) hide and wait again 30 mins until alien goes away.

Only if you are a hardcore fan of the alien franchaise."

The backtracking to open some new areas was annoying as you would see locked doors and want to unlock them but can't. Then near the end of the game, it's like, oh, this one door I saw at the very beginning of the game is entering the final area.

once i finally finished that part the next level was the exact same, die, try again, die, try again, with every death sending me back 15 minutes,  just for it to happen again.

now, this got INCREDIBLY ANNOYING, i used to love this game when i played it on xbox one and i had one of the best horror experiences to this day, and the start of the game was thrilling, but when i die now, its more of a ""oh for f**k sake i have to go through this stupid sh** again""

It absolutely nails the aesthetics and atmosphere of the original movie, but unfortunately for me its just not a fun game.  Walking around at a snails pace and then having to reload each encounter multiple times because its very unclear how to progress just grates the hell outa this for me.  For example, after you get the hacking tool, there's a bunch of baddies that come into the room you're in. they'll absolutely obliterate you if your seen, and there's only one very prescriptive way of getting past them that I only figured out after having to replay the sequence several times .  Having to reload several times from the last save point just isn't fun for me and neither is having one very particular way of getting past an obstacle in a stealth game like like.

Maybe I'm just too stupid to play this effectively?  I don't often play stealthy horror games so this ain't my normal jam, but I couldn't find the enjoyment in this.  Same, as i'm a huge fan of the original movie and was really enjoying the visuals and vibe of isolation."
716,1,0.4405,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I really tried to like this game. It started out fine. The retro-futuristic visuals are lovely, acting is good enough, story is like any other alien story so it's fine, it's stealth and you hide from things, I love that, but further you go into the game, less freedom you have. It's often just two hallways and some people and you hide in one hallway and throw an item in another hallway and avoid people. Oh, there's tons of different items, but they are all practically the same. Some explode and make noise, some make fire and noise, some make smoke and noise, some just make noise, it doesn't matter. Nothing you do matters. Your wayfinder doesn't point towards the goal, but towards the road you need to take, so you just blindly follow it.
After a few hours, the good stuff happens! You see the alien! But it's in a cut scene so not really scary. Then you start avoiding the alien, but alien has no proper AI, it's like a teleporting robot that lumbers around and turns up wherever the story demands, but in such an obvious way that it breaks all the immersion.
I play most stealth games on hard difficulty. I reduced this one to easy because everything annoyed me, but it was still annoying, so I just uninstalled it. I think I'm about half way through and slightly interested where the story goes, but not enough to waste another 10 hours on this."
717,3,0.6689,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I would say there is a good 5-7 hours of great game here. Unfortunately, it took me around 20 to beat the game. By the end it is very repetitive and the Alien goes from being scary to just an annoyance. My advice would be to buy it on a good sale, play the first couple hours to get a feel for the game, and then uninstall it and watch a Let’s Play that chops the rest of the game down into a few hours."
718,3,0.4755,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I can't recommend this for anyone who gets motion sickness. The FOV slider works the opposite way you think it would. The initial FOV is really zoomed in and made me kind of nauseated. When you increase the FOV (slider to the right oddly enough), you get this really terrible ""zoom"" effect on objects in the corner of the screen, so a thin can will suddenly look much wider than it really is, and it gets quite blurry. This gives you an even weirder feeling in your peripheral vision.

On that basis alone I can't recommend this game no matter the discount if you suffer from any motion sickness at all, it will mess you up."
719,3,0.4921,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","If you dont like stealth and are not a fan of the alien franchise I would not suggest this game. It was on sale when I got it and figured I would give it a try based on all the positive reviews. I am not a fan of the alien series but I figured I would try this. 

The AI is very dumb. Even on hardest level. Sound wasnt that good. Most times the ambient noise bled into the characters voices so you couldnt hear them well. Even after adjusting the settings. Ripley sounded like she was a drunk with her slurred and prolonged voice. Not sure who the actor was but it was bad. 

Graphically it was ok, not much to say here. You are on a ship so theres nothing really to render with all the hallways and small rooms. 

The stealth of this game reminds me of the guards from Payday 2. The alien is just like them. It just sits there waiting or goes into the next room where you need to be and always is where you are. Its basically just a waiting game for the alien to move on so you can progress. I guess that helped me and I didnt find it hard at all. 

Again, if you dont like slow boring stealth and are not a fan of the alien world I would say to not pick this up even for sale."
720,1,0.6443,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Alien Isolation is an atmospheric Sci-Fi game.

To touch on the positives, the game is very atmospheric.  The robots are kind of cool even though they can apparently take a billion shots to the head without malfunctioning.  They also seem to love giving frontal shoulder massages, which is nice of them.  The game might've been decent if not for the unrelenting feature creature.

Now to the negatives.  If you're expecting any sort of interesting plot, stories, characters, character development, or well written dialogue, I'd lower your expectations because you ain't gonna find them here.  Now let me fill you in on the story of the game.  “Ripley, this thing is broken.  Go fix it.”  “On my way................. Fixed it.”  “Great job Ripley, but this other thing is broken.  Go fix it.”  “On my way................ Fixed it.”  “Stupendous job Ripley, but the space telescope is broken.  Go fix it.”  “On my way................ Fixed it.”  “Outstanding job Ribley, but I clogged up the toilet that's on the other side of the station 4 floors down.  Go unclog it.”  “On my way................ Unclogged it.”  “Spectacular job Ridley, but the space station is headed into the sun.  Go turn off the sun.”  “On my way..............  Turned it off.................... oh, everyone's dead but me.  That sucks.”  I get the game needs reasons to send you all over the place but I almost wish they hadn't bothered.

The biggest problem with the game is the alien.  To start with, it's invincible.  I've seen some Alien movies.  At no point do I remember them being invincible.  In fact, I'm fairly certain I watched regular weapons tear through them without much issue.  Now, maybe I'm not up to speed on all the latest Alien lore, but could someone inform me which movie/tv show/book/comic established that aliens are now born with adamantium skin?  I missed that one.  There is a reason that they make the alien invincible for this game and it should be pretty obvious to anyone who isn't a complete idiot (unless you know nothing about this series).

The problem with the alien is that it isn't scary, it's annoying and time consuming.  Some people seem to think it has great AI.  From what I experienced it's more like random nonsense AI and it occasionally flagrantly cheats.  The alien works much like Xzibit does in the Resident Evil 2 remake.  He follows you all over the police station in that game and slowly chases you if he sees you.  At first he's kind of cool but then he becomes an obnoxious annoyance as you just want to gather items or complete puzzles and he won't leave you alone for 30 seconds so you can do so.  At least in that game he's contained to the police station and isn't much of a threat unless he walks up on you in an area you left a licker alive in.  The alien pops up most places in this game and quite often patrols areas you're in.  Some other notable differences:  If the alien spots you, it moves at super speed and instakills you when it gets to you.  You're given a flamethrower later on which can scare it away (potentially, sometimes it just runs right through it) which helps relieve some of the doldrum.  You can also craft some items that are mostly useless to distract it.

You're going to spend about 20-35% of the game just hiding and waiting around for the alien to wander away or hop in a vent again so you can continue.  Probably my favorite moment was when I was sent to retrieve a keycard in this semi-circle area.  Once you get the keycard, there's only one way out of the semi-circle area and there's a vent along the pathway.  So I exit the room and the alien immediately pops out of the vent. I go back into the room and hide in a locker.  The alien walks in, searches around, leaves the room and takes a right and walks about 5 steps, turns around and walks back to the vent and hops in.  I leave the room, alien immediately pops out of the vent, repeat the whole process.  I hop back out of the locker a 3rd time and leave the room, alien immediately hops back out of vent, repeat the whole process yet again.  I wait 30 seconds this time before getting out of the locker, step out of room, take about 3 steps down the hallway, alien pops out of vent.  Repeat the fun process again.  I was stuck back in this area for 10+ minutes because this damn thing wouldn't go the fuck away for a minute.

If you've played Amnesia before, imagine playing that except instead of the monsters disappearing after a bit they followed you around all game long, kept wandering around blocking up the main hallways and run at blazing fast speeds.

Alien Isolation is a below average game.  It greatly outstays its welcome by at least 5+ hours.  Its terrible AI alien creature becomes tiresome by the 4th or 5th time you run into it.  The developers should've learned from much better games.  Invincible creatures in horror games are best used when they rarely/randomly show up or are used in short burst segments.  Constantly hounding the player with an invincible creature doesn't make it scary.  It makes it tedious, annoying, and time consuming.  The game feels like a grind.  The only thing that's survival horror about this game is that I survived how bad it was and didn't uninstall it before I finished it."

game would be more tolerable if it had quicksave instead of finding saving spots. saving takes forever, it goes through unnecessary animations. rewiring is not worth the time. the game is crealy made with consoles in mind and poorly adapted to pc.

now i have to finish the game so my money wont go to waste. this game is definitely on my bad games list.

good things? the game has never crashed. it was scary at fisrt not to get detected, but it got old and boring really quick. the game is 95% hiding. crafting doesnt pay off, and you have to backtrack to get some stuff.

With that in mind, I think this game will still only appeal to a select few from that fanbase. Although the atmosphere is gutwrenchingly intense, the gameplay can be VERY slow. I don't think this is a bad game at all, but I think on the surface and in promotional materials, the game misrepresents itself and there are some people who will definitely be disappointed. You have to have a lot of patience going into this game and you often have to try seemingly menial tasks very carefully and slowly (and often after you have died trying many many times). You should know going into this, it's not a first person shooter (anybody who tells you it is, doesn't know what they are talking about).

You walk into some beautifully staged gaming areas full of ambiance and wish to proceed with your goal.  Then, you get to a door and it's locked.  You have to run around and figure out a way to unlock it.  It's like running around in a maze trying to solve a puzzle.  Then you get to another locked door only to find out you need a special tool to unlock it.  That leads to more running around back in the same area where you were.  Sometimes you have to crawl around a vent, start a generator, break a lock, find a data card, access a data terminal, etc.  To make things worse, they add enemies to deal with while still trying to figure out how to do all that without getting detected by them.  You have to use special terminals to save your game.  If something comes up in real life or you die, you have to do it all again from that point when it wasn't that much fun to begin with.  It's annoying as hell is what it is.  I don't care how much you love ""Alien"", the game play just isn't fun.  Sorry.

I was hoping for at least one of these to be true and was sorely disappointed. 
The horror-aspect was dispelled early on after the alien (or any enemy) behaved in stupid, predictable ways and completly gone after the hundreth time you see an alien. After that, Its just jump-scares all the way down.
Instead of nail-biting stealth-action, the game just devolves into a series of bash-your-head-against-the-wall-until-it-works levels. Retrying over and over, randomly dying to bullshit traps in the gamedesign.
The story is also completely vacuous. Its basically ""oh you want light? Fetch a lightbulb. Oh you screwed it in and no light? go turn on the power. Still dark? Go to the breaker-room..."" and on and on and on it goes. No character development, no real memorable side-characters, no investment in the hook of the story. The ending was very unsatisfying too.

If I could give something less than ""not recommended"", I would.

At least it looks nice."

It is scary, it really is; that point they got right. The atmosphere and especially the sound/music design is excellently done. I was constantly afraid of running into the Alien. You run into the Alien you die.
And that is what broke it too, the dying. You will die a lot. And that means losing some progress which you have to redo when loading the last save. All that dying took away the scary part. Instead of prioritizing the next objective I ended up looking for a new save point where to save the game so I don't lose much progress. And at that point the atmosphere and scary part was gone.
The Alien is close to you way too often to be scary in the long run. It's great at first but later on it's not scary any more.

The alien is magnetized to the player to such an extent that the alien loses its scare factor by the medical level. it either sees you and you die or you hide and live repeat till the end of the game with some slight variation after you get the molotov or flamethrower to be fair, but even then resources wise it is usually just best to let it kill you so you have the resources for later."

I think the worst thing about the game is, ironically, the Alien. This guy is insanely smart. He hears everything you do, whether it be opening doors, turning on generators, or firing a gun. It sounds like it would be really cool, but when even running causes him to jump out from hiding and dash towards you at the speed of light killing you instantly, the game becomes a real slog because you have to walk/crouch everywhere in order to safely get by. I actually really enjoyed the first 4 or so hours of this game when all you have to worry about are the Androids lol.
It's a shame too because I think literally everything else about this game is great, the music is very atmospheric, graphics are so perfect, it looks just like the movies. They really captured that clean 80's spaceship design from the films.
The crafting system is a really cool idea as well but I found that most of the items were pretty useless. Guns don't do enough damage and make too much noise so they attract the Alien very easily so I never used them. The stun baton doesn't stun enemies long enough so usually you end up being pursued anyways.
 There are other items like the flashbang and pipebomb meant for use on the Alien but the problem is that you don't have enough time to deploy an item if the Alien sees you because he runs so fast, I think the game would have really benefited from some kind of defense items like the ones in Resident Evil, where during your death animation you can press a button to throw out an item to stun the enemy and let you get away.

It's not terrible at all, but it's very frustrating and for how long it is I don't think I can play all the way through it, so I don't really recommend it."

The game simply overstays it's welcome, I think it would have been much better if it was half the length of the final product. The entire game is built around it's main mechanic - the Alien. The Alien is amazing, but when that's all that the game has going for it, it wears off at about the half way point. I think that no matter how good your core mechanic/gameplay loop is, it can't carry the rest of the game to success. So if you get bored of the Alien, don't expect it to get any better.

tl;dr: got bored of the alien about half way through the game, but the Alien IS the game."

I felt the need from the start to conserve all my items, however I ended up not using them as the game is easily beaten without them.

762,1,0.4883,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Initially, this was set up to be one of my favorite games of all time. As a huge fan of the Alien series, and a lover of stealth games, this game was right up my alley. Both thematically, and gameplay-wise. The first few hours were very entertaining. The mystery of Sevastopol and its inhabitants was something I cared about. The stealth mechanics and constant adrenaline from trying to evade the Xenomorph kept me on my toes and engaged with the game...up until a certain point.

After a few hours, the Xeno is no longer ""scary"", but instead, becomes nothing but an annoying hindrance between you and your objective. And with the limited save system, if you make one misstep and the Xeno comes after you, you pretty much have to start all over again. Depending on the difficulty level you're playing on, you'll end up going through the same loop over and over again. And it just loses the fun at that point. But that's not even the worst part.

Once you sneak your way past the Xeno and get to your current objective, lo and behold, you'll find out that the door you needed to get to is unpowered! And now you'll have to sneak your way across the map to start up the generator. But oh no! You'll need the right key to start up the generator! Now you have to travel to some lab to find the right key to turn on the generator, to power the door in order for you to proceed. 

Because of this constant game mechanic that never wants to make it easy on you, the gameplay becomes repetitive very quickly. Don't ever expect the current objective to be your only objective. Always expect some obstacle to be in your way, and be prepared to backtrack and sneak your way across the map several times, before you can even get through that ""one door"" you were supposed to get through in the beginning. 

All in all, I enjoyed the first few hours of this game, and that was it. The remaining 10+ hours became a frustrating chore that I forced myself to get through in order to complete the game and its story. If you enjoy tons of backtracking and reloading your game every time you get caught by the Xeno, then maybe this game is for you. But if these things don't sound appealing, then I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere."

767,3,0.5398,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","[i]That's amazing. What is it?[/i]

Let's start with a big clap for the absolutely gorgeous visuals, sound and music - full of nostalgia and genuine respect for the franchise. The game is beautiful. All those involved with developing the assets, world, sound and music should be congratulated. A lot of hard-work went into nailing the atmosphere from the first film and it comes together really well. It runs well in 4K and captures that grimy 70's vision of the future that Alien did so well.

[i]Anybody ever tell you you look dead, man?[/i]

Unfortunately that's where the praise ends. The game itself revolves around walking/crouching from point to point, spending 30% of the time hiding, 20% of the time walking, 40% of the time dying (only to repeat the same crap over and over again from the last save point) and 10% pressing buttons. It's a true exercise in frustration - The gameplay just isn't there. Yeah it nails the horror vibe - but rather than being scared, it just gets you annoyed. The save mechanic - while no doubt implemented to add to the sense of loss upon a death - makes things far more annoying than they should be as well. You will die a lot - and in doing so will just be spending your time replaying the same areas over and over again.

What on earth did they do to the Alien as well? Rather than hiding in the shadows for an opportune moment to strike like a stealthy panther waiting to pounce, this one stomps around upright in full view with what sounds like clogs on. It sticks to you like glue, but is seemingly unable to see you behind a chair. I can't help but think they turned the Alien into more of a clanky, loud Terminator than a stealthy predator like it should be.

[i]If we ain't out of here in ten minutes, we won't need no rocket to fly through space[/i]

Clearly not the game for me - and I say that with genuine sadness. I wanted to adore it. I avoided this one on launch because I feared it would be like this... and I should have ""listened"" to myself. I was persuaded by a friend to pick it up on sale, but no amount of adoring the source material can persuade me that this game is anything other than a mess. As much as I want to continue, if only for the story and atmosphere, I just can't - especially since from what I read, the game is long and the last half is a slog. At this point, I would only be playing because of love for the franchise and curiosity for the story - not enjoyment (it pains me to say). Will I continue with it despite all this? Not sure. Time will tell...

[i]Micro changes in air density, my ass.[/i]

Lovers of stealth and horror games will probably get more out of it than I have. But when even the stealth mechanic (which is the majority of actual gameplay) is lacklustre, boring and frustrating, I would steer away from it in favour of games that do it better. Loving the Alien franchise is not enough here... sadly.

- good graphics
- good sound
- scary in the beginning only, when you do not know what to expect 
- alien can not see you if you hide behind a flower or chair, small table

Disadvantages:
- Alien is always around you, whatever you do, wherever you are, you can be killed and replay  a couple of your last hours

- Alien can smell you, because of that you can not hide from him
- Alien can teleport to you and kill, even if he is locked in panic room, teleported an killed me during  quest dialog, lol
- You are visible in complete, total, black hole dark spots by humans, and of course alien
- you are visible by miles away under table  within darkness 
- it is not possible to run away from alien 90% if he spots you, you are dead
- dumb tasks and tooltips, really, 80% of time you do not hide, you are looking for something, you do not know where or what it is and how to get it. I used youtube guides to figure WT* I must to do for many tasks.
Unless you fond of amnesia, this one brainf**k definitely for you.
- saves,***king s**t, you may spent 40 minutes hiding, checking rooms, collecting stuff, and then you got killed with one shot by alien, next stage is to remove this game and get refund or repeat your sex with alien
- alien headshot with 0.45 revolver does 0 dmg to him, it even not stun or scares him at all. Do bother wasting ammo 
- alien can here you in distance 20-25 meters, your movement sensor is 10 meters
- if human try to kill you and alien kills any of your enemies, you loose, cool yes? How about enemy of my enemy is my friend? No? Ok.
- alien is always around you wherever you are on Death Star station. 1 alien is everywhere and nobody can kill it. 
- if you stealth kill human, alien will hear you on the other end of the galaxy
- alien is immune to fire, flame thrower 500 ammo waster, 0 result

Verdict:
Buy only with huge discount  75%+ and more. 
As horror, I would recommend Outlast and Slenderman. 
Best horrors I played. Here? I spent 10 minutes hiding, 2 minutes crouching and 30 sec running, after that I am dead and repeat it many times until  game was finished.  As a result, I can say, that is not a horror, but a waste of time.

770,3,0.4542,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I am so torn about this review.  If there was a Meh option, I would rate it as that.  Like many others, I hold the Alien movies as my favourite Scifi horror ever since I saw Alien when I was like 9 and it scared the crap out of me.

Ultimately, I think this game fails as a game but is definitely a mostly solid Alien experience.  First off, if this is the first time playing it, do yourself the biggest favor and choose and easier difficulty.  I started on the hardest (which is what I always do in stealth games) and got so frustrated I almost uninstalled; instead, I dropped the difficulty to the level above the lowest.  The reason why?  The AI is not forgiving....at all.  I got so fed up of waiting 5 minutes in a locker for the damn Alien to leave.  

I see this 'game' as more of a exploration/walking-sim.  The level design and textures are very high quality.  Voice acting and sound effects are quite good too.  Music, I thought was spirited well from the source material.  A lot of adventuring back to places you've been before to unlock new stuff.  The problem as a game though was I really didn't feel I had to use my items.  Yes they were there on the odd occasion to need them but mostly, thoughtful study of your surroundings and timing make it pretty straightforward to walk where you need to go.  I didn't really consider them necessary items for survival thus most of the time, I just spend walking around (which I'm normally fine with.)

I got a couple jump scares (mostly from Working Joes lol) but I didn't find the game scary.  There were tense parts, yes, but at a point, the Alien becomes very predictable when it spawns and where it goes and that took the immersion away mostly and just got too annoying waiting for it to stop pacing.  I would've rather had a much more tense game with less frequent Alien spawns but more highly randomized/erratic travel patterns.  This way, I would've felt I had to survive those encounters more than just keep hiding until she goes away.  For the number of vent crawling you do in this game, I only had the Alien come into the vent twice!  That was not nearly enough times considering that is one of the most epic scenes of the Alien series let alone most horror movies.  The animations of the Alien were great, I just think the ferocity of the creatures would've been better suited without being able to predict when it was going to hunt you next versus another npc.

I really didn't like the consolized inventory far to cumbersome to use in action and crafting was just confusing.  Also there were way too many QTE and lever pulling interactions.  This 'game' could also be called  a 'lever pulling simulator.'

If they do a follow-up, I would still probably try it."

773,3,0.3474,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Wow, what a terrible game. Let me rephrase that, what a terrible 2nd and 3rd act to the game. The first 8 hours or so are gold. Seriously, awesome sense of tension, varied enemies, interesting scenarios, then it all falls flat and the ending sucks donkey butts. Now, to be fair, I got this game for 2$ on the steam sale so I have nothing to complain about, but if I had spent 60 or 80 dollars, I would be livid. After the 1st act, most of the game is total padding, save for some cool parts in the second act. This game suffers from the ""press this button to activate the [insert sci-fi device here] which in turn needs to be controlled by the [insert scifi device here]; but wait, the diesel generator needs to be activated here first"" trope. The little mini puzzles on some computer screens as well as the hacking device were cool, but got boring after a while. I wish with each upgrade you would unlock some sort of new mini game to play on the device that allowed you to progress further, not just the arbitray level 1 - level 3 scanner that exists right now. 

As I said before though, there are good parts. The xenomorph is scary, and as you progress through the game it gets smarter, more resilient, and more deadly. The problem is, only about 30% of the game is you going 1 on 1 with the xenomorph. That's kind of a problem for a game called ""Alien Isolation"". There's not much Alien, and there's not much isolation as you're constantly surrounded by AI survivors, seegson synthetics, and ai friends that tell you what to do over comms before getting brutally murdered once they have served their purpose to the plot. 

Let me also add, for a game that touts itself as being non-combat focused, you certainly do a lot of fighting. There are whole sections of the game, specifically with the working joes that end up devolving into combat, in fact the game actively encourages it sometimes. That pretty much concludes my non spoilers talk, read further if you dare.

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

BTW I was playing the game on hard mode

jettisoning the alien for the first time felt awesome. The final quote unquote ""boss area"" was a bit different than what I was used to and the feeling of finally getting rid of that alien bastard felt great. That was only the first of three acts though. If the game had ended after act 1, I would have been happy. You could have even just slapped in the game end's cutscene and called it a day. 

Many people will crucify me for this but the whole rest of the game could have been cut and I would have been fine with it. Now granted, the second act with Appolo AI and the alien hive was kind of neat and offered something different, but even here the cracks begin to show. Downgraded textures, low poly models, the start of the ""what the hell am I actually doing anyways I'm just pressing buttons and starting generators"" feeling. In other words, it becomes tedious, and you finding out that the whole first quarter of the game was literally for nothing since there are hundreds more xenomorphs onboard the station did not feel very rewarding to me. It's around this point in the game that you get the bolt gun and you have officially completed your arsenal so there is literally nothing more new in the game after this point.

After you clear the hive, the game majorly starts to drag. You get a few more cool moments where seegson synthetics are fighting humans, find out your buddy got impregnated by a face hugger (btw sorry I don't remember a single side character's name they are all soooo forgettable and most of them interact with you through a plexiglass window so sorry). I honestly have barely any recollection of this section of the game since I was so bored that my body went onto autopilot (I am not joking). Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the first of two spacewalk sections. These parts of the game alone take up easily 20 minutes each, and feature little to no dialogue at all, snail's pace movement, and the classic Alien isolation pressing buttons then thing happens that progresses the game. This was when I realized what the word ""padding"" meant in relation to game design. At one point you have to get through a room chocked full of xenomorphs that literally spawn out of a vent on the top of the staircase and make their way down to the command room below. I saw them spawning!!! This completely ruins the tension created in earlier acts, and legitimately made me think the devs had run out of ideas. 

Then bam, right as your about to put on your spacesuit the devs put a vent above the spacesuit cupboard and boom, instead of killing you they drag you down to another hive area where, you guessed it, nothing happens! There is about 30 minutes or so where you are just crawling through low poli debrey that looks like it's straight from half life 2 while shooting facehuggers that pop up out of nowhere. During this time you can have totaly disregard for noise even though you are literally in a xenomorph hive (according to the radar) because video game. In this area you also get on of my favourite parts of the game (certainly not sarcastic), the train section. Because apparently even while the entire station is falling apart, people still need to use public transport. Oh, you thought maybe the trains would come by in a pattern with specific time intervals between each train where you would have to progress to the next safe area? Wrong! They are triggered by your character model reaching a specific point (Ie scripted event that kills you if you're not fast enough). You do eventually make it to the nostromo, but wait, there's a xenomorph randomly on board with no explenation, hit left and right to trap it in the airlock and kill yourself. What a joke.

Overall, this game is a 6.5/10 for me. It's definitely above average and there are real feelings of tension in some parts, but it gets bogged down by filler content, non-xenomorph parts that are too combat focused, and lack of progressions after the second act.

774,3,0.4361,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","For me, a first impression plays a crucial part in my fondness of a video game I play, and in this case Alien:Isolation has disappointed me. The barely moving, robot-like characters, poor story line and the lack of plot logic all had a role in this. It just feels like as if you are watching an american movie, with the film-like music, scripted events (cracks and noises), which might be good for some, but for me it made it much less scary and atmospheric. The thing I hated the most and which stopped me from further trying to progress in the story is the total lack of interaction of the main character with the atmosphere. She can only say: ""Oh, what happened here"", when seeing a deserted terminal, however she completely ignores packed dead bodies lined up in one of the rooms. So lazy.

The production quality, graphics and voice acting are all obviously up to AAA standard. The voice acting is especially brilliant - some of the best I've ever heard in a game. It's certainly well made. The audio design is fantastic.

However, as a game, I just don't think it's very good. It doesn't play well. It doesn't seem to direct you very well as a player. Most of the time I have no idea where I'm supposed to go. I keep randomly dying to NPCs and the Alien itself, but usually without any kind of visual / audio warning. It all just feels a bit clunky.

As for the horror, personally, it just really misses the mark for me. It's feels stale and predictable. The build-up is monumentally long for a horror game, and the payoff is such a disappointment. As an avid fan of horror games, I can say this is probably the least frightening game I've ever played when accounting for the time year it was released, hardware limits at the time, budget, setting, etc. If you want a better game and a more frightful experience, maybe stick to Dead Space, Resident Evil, Outlast, Amnesia, Subnautica, Evil Within or Penumbra.

782,3,0.591,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing",Well... What can I say about this game.. Here is my very short review with 55.4 hours as I just completed the game.. I thought the game was going to be way better than what it was. I was really excited about this game when it came out  as I was about all the Alien movies. I thought that this was going to be a new fresh start for alien games to make up for past failures. Not True. I actually felt that I wasted 55.4 hours of my precious life that I can never get back and I could of played something way much better and here are some of my reasons. The game is WAY too long and very repetitive I could not wait for it to end 3/4 of the way though. Aliens can not be killed and it the same repetitive alien hunts you down the entire game till the end when you have 2 to 3 really lame ones. Some of the alien encounters are scripted in no matter how quiet you are. The maps go back and fourth and sometimes confusing with too many tasks to complete. There is a lot of hiding which slows the game way down expecially on harder levels. The story line could have been much better... got lost with it sometimes seems like they just threw it together at times. The ending was the worst.... horrible for this game. Pretty sad.. Expected much more. Really.... Looks like it was rushed or maybe lack of funds. Figured there was going to be something interesting in the credits... Nope Nothing... Really surprising. My suggestion is to if you want a really awesome intense Sci-Fi game. Stick to DEAD SPACE and stay away from this one..
783,3,0.3686,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","The AI makes this game horrible. It's good otherwise. Use the mod to make the pistol force the alien to retreat and the mod to randomize the alien. Otherwise the alien seems so fake that I can't take the game seriously. They use a bunch of AI tricks to make the alien ""scary"" but people who play a lot of games see right through it. Watch the alien teleport in the video below. When you play the game, you'll feel like the alien is teleporting around too. This confirms it.

The Good:
Nice graphics.
Decent story and atmosphere.
Adequate sound design.
Neat immersive interface (including quick-save system). nearly no HUD.

The Bad:
Its a console port with annoying QTEs and very clunky controls. Sometimes the controls don't even respond, resulting in player death.
The main stealth gameplay is cheap and un-intuitive - the alien has no peripheral vision and can't see you 5m right in front of it as long as you break line of sight within 2 sec, yet homes in on you when you are far away making no noise. It often ignores loud environmental noises, but always hears player footsteps, further breaking my sense of immersion.
Poor game pacing - you're hunted almost all the time, so it just gets repetitive and tedious.
Overly scripted scenes that are predictable and play loose with internal logic.
Difficulty feels inconsistent, and there is a lack of difference between all difficulty levels - ""novice"" felt just as hard as ""hard"".
Sound cues lack consistent positioning and distance information, which can be confusing
Level design is restrictive - mostly repetitive corridors and square shaped rooms with lots of conveniently placed cover.
Poor facial expressions and bad lip sync.
PC mouse control has a dead zone and a lot of smoothing."

All in all, this game is just another franchise that is made to make a quick buck. 

In my opinion, if you wanna try this game, only buy it if it is on really good sale. I bought it on a 95% discount so I don't regret paying the money but I regret putting this much time into it.

It is repetitive, power in this area is out. Restore power before moving on. Ripley can't jump, not even step over basic obstacles. WHY?
Have gaming standards dropped that low that an average licensed game can get such high praise? We have forgotten what good is. One section where I am being hunted the alien disappears up a vent. I walk around a corner to find it just there. What?! How did you get there all of a sudden?! There are no vents overhead at this point. Unless you have fire you have ZERO chance of escape if you are spotted by either the alien. Its 8 legged offspring can be shot but why is this small thing a one hit kill?!. Yet Ripley can take a bullet or two...
Visually it holds up well but that's about it.

The game aint perfect by any measure, but is fine as far as gameplay goes. There are some boring and extraneous feelings segments, and the arbitrary nature of the alien mechanics, can be really annoying at times. But all  in all, it's fine as far as actual game play goes.

The real star of the thing is the atmosphere,. It is frigging amazing. Alien is one of my all time fav things in the world, and this game recreates that world down to the smallest details. I seriously can't praise that side of the thing enough.

However... What kills the thing though, is the ending. It just sucks. Big time. So before you commit to the slog, be forewarned that the thing does not have a real ending. It just ends - after a steady increase in stakes, building to a big finale. But instead of that, it just ends with a frigging quick time event, followed by a short cinematic scene. You know, one one of those lazy dumb and irritating ""oh my, I wonder what happened"", open to interpretation BS deals.

All the time I put into this game... Wasted. Shouldn't have bothered with tags, logs and extra stuff or achievements. All that extra effort just aggravates the piss poor ending. No closure no nothing. No feeling of accomplishment. Sad really.

Lucky for me I bought it at that recent super sale. Though, even if I had paid full price, I really wouldn't care  care about the money. What I want back is all the time I wasted. Life is too precious to be squandered on a game with this weak story. Meh.

I'm sure there are those who think it was a smashing ending, and if you are one of those, then good for you. But if you are like me, and like to have some closure, and preferably a feeling of having accomplished something by the end, then this is definitely not the game for you."

807,3,0.4703,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Couldn't recommend the game because the 2nd half just lets it down:

Pros:
+Great atmosphere
+Great soundtrack and audio
+First 3-4 hours is pretty good in terms of horror.
+Graphics pretty good for 2014.
+Alien AI is alright, its pretty unpredictable compared to other enemies in this game. (However, sometimes it just completely ignores you entering a locker right infront of it, either it is toying with me or just missed me).

Cons:
-Game no longer scary after 2nd half, especially with flamethrower and after [spoiler] the alien is ejected from station and there is no alien for another 3 hours.  [/spoiler]
-Human AI is trash and inconsistent, either they see you in pitch black a mile away or they miss you when you're right infront of them. Also, the humans appear incredibly stupid, there are occasions where they know the alien is nearby but for some reason will still decide to shoot you; therefore attracting the alien and killing them.
-The gameplay becomes extremely repetitive in 2nd half, every time you complete an objective something breaks and you have to backtrack to fix a generator or press a button, artificially increasing the length of the game. This padding of time is the worst in space EVA sections where you are unable to run and have to walk for about 10 minutes to a button and 10 minutes back to the space station. [spoiler] Especially the end, wtf were they thinking when the last objective in the game is to manually prime 4 explosives, each of which take around 15 seconds of animation. [/spoiler]

Overall, I can't recommend the game for the 2nd half, it no longer becomes fun and the alien just becomes a nuisance rather than scary. Perhaps if they ended the game at an earlier point ([spoiler] eg after destroying the NEST in reactor core [/spoiler] it would have been a better game.

The first half(ish) of the campaign was an amazing tribute to the original film- the characters, the ship design, and, of course, the alien.  I spent so many hours hiding in lockers and under desks clutching my motion tracker for dear life, and it was delightfully tense and horrifying.  As I neared the end of the campaign, the game became an irritating, repetitive mess, filled with countless objectives involving pulling levers, flipping switches, and backtracking to do more of said pulling and flipping.  But perhaps one of the biggest disappointments was how the alien became more of a (non-scary) nuisance towards the end.  I felt like I was spraying a cat with a water bottle so that I could get things done.  Not to mention that the developers took the idea of Murphy's Law a little bit too far with poor Ripley- it was just exhausting.

I've been playing less video games since I moved to Nevada, where prostitution is legal, however when I saw this on sale for 2 dollars my Jewish blood urged me to buy it. The game should've ended halfway through, yet it dragged on and has you doing the same actions over and over again. The atmosphere and space-ship environment really made this game enthralling for about eight hours, and so when the charm wore off it really was a childish repetition of mini-games, with robots, humans, and the alien filling in the gaps between the points. There are story-driven games that could hold my attention for 100+ hours because of the different characters and settings. This is a game where you're mostly by yourself hitting switches in a dank, bland setting. 

I was misled into playing this by the positive reviews--they were on point with it being scary, even if the game did become dull--but I will say that the negatives I've read weren't there for me. It didn't crash once. The saving system was great because it created tension and added to the gameplay since you have to gamble if hostiles are nearby. And the only bugs I noticed were a few guns floating near corpses."
816,1,0.5791,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Great atmosphere, ruined by repetitive gameplay, tedious animations and plot contrivances.

The design of the space station, combined with the music and everything really makes you feel like you're in an Alien movie (more specifically the first one).
It feels great in the beginning, when you're exploring and get little tidbits of story and what happened to the Nostromo. But then the game shows more and more problems.
First are the animations, which first seem atmospheric, but after the third time or so, seem to me to really be designed with padding in mind. And there are sooo many of them, pulling levers, pushing buttons, pulling levers with both hands, removing locks, restarting generators (by pulling a lever), the list goes on. Later in the game come multiple sequences, where you're on the outside of the station in a spacesuit. Here the game shows its true colors by making you walk substantial distances (no running allowed) to an area where you pull multiple levers, push several buttons, dial in numbers in even more lengthy animations ONLY to have to walk all the way back. The first sequence outside takes about 10 minutes in real time, and NOTHING substantial happens (yes the scenery is pretty, but you forget about that after the first 30 seconds).

Then we come to the stealth mechanics and the Alien's AI. The basic mechanics are okay, although not very complex. You have some tools to help you, like noisemakers, but when the alien is around you better not run ever, or you will be 1hit very fast. Humans and androids really don't have complex behavior, and can be dealt with by using your weapons (if you've got the ammo/resources). Although there's a part later on, where the androids suddenly wear anti-static coats, so your EMP and stun gun don't work against them, and you're forced into stealth (at least on hard?).
Then the alien.
I'm actually kind of baffled that the alien's AI got so much praise. It roams around in a semi-unpredictable manner, which seems to consist of 'walk a short/medium/long distance in direction x. stop. walk in another direction. after repeating for a few times, go back into the vents.' While being more complex than many games' AI, I wouldn't ever call this revolutionary.
On top of that, it's quite problematic from a gameplay viewpoint. Most areas consist of small rooms connected by corridors. Both are not very wide, and there are not very many places to hide (although sometimes there are tables you can see over but the alien can not, and you can play ring around the rosie). 
In almost all cases, the whole level you're in is very linear, and you have to get to the other side through a chokepoint. That means, if the alien is roaming around, in many many cases you have to either hope the alien doesn't randomly turn around, or you have to hide and have the patience of a saint until it pisses off into the vents (there are not enough resources to always use a noisemaker, molotov etc). If you mess up and the alien sees you, there is basically nothing you can do (in the first half of the game) but restart from the last savepoint, which is sometimes not very close. Later on, there are even scripted instances where the alien enters the area you're in and you're forced to fight it (or hide until it's gone again, wasting your time more than anything).
At this point I don't feel like I'm being hunted, I don't even care about being in an alien movie anymore, I just want it to be over with. The unpredictable behavior is just frustrating in the narrow corridors.

The story is okay, but feels a bit re-hashed at times. Also there are a few parts that are identical to parts of the first movie, and only seem to be there for fanservice.
Later on, it becomes more and more contrived. Almost everything that goes wrong on this station seems to only impact the protagonist. Then there's the amount that goes wrong. Everything seems to work against you. There are at least three elevators that malfunction right as you enter them. 
In the last third of the game there are countless times where you have a certain objective and the game only wants to throw a spanner in the works. 
You should open this door to proceed - oh wait, you need a keycard for that, better go into the other room and fetch it. You put it in the scanner and JUST then the power goes out, better go into the other room to restart the generator.
You should hack these two consoles. The first one works, the second one needs power - you better crawl in that vent to pull the lever to turn the power back on.
You want to put on a spacesuit to go outside. Oh, the alien is right above you in the vents, but it doesn't kill you like all those times before, when you actually had control of your character. It just drags you down to get impregnated, and you have to fight your way back to the exact same airlock.
You should release these clamps. Oh, seems you need a manual override for that, better go around, pull a lever to open a box, to be able to pick up a keycard, to put in the slot right next to it. Thought you were done? Better repeat it on the other side. Then you can release the clamps, right? Just kidding, there a four of them, each one is an animation that takes a full fifteen seconds, and you have to manually click ALL FOUR of them.

And then the game ends on a cliffhanger."

All My points bellow still stand in fact some get worse.  The game is not this be all end all the positive reviews say it is. I get it I do this is the alien game so many wanted for so long. The visuals are great the game sound is good and nerve racking. Yet we should not pretend this is some sort of master class game it is at best a decent middle of the road game. As an alien universe story it's decent on the other hand as a game it's TEDIOUS to an absurd degree. That's the best word for this game TEDIOUS.
-----------------------------------------------------  

How does this game have so many glowing reviews?  I love stealth game from classic thief the dark project to ones like Velvet assassin  My prefer play is ghost/knockout everyone. But a good stealth kill fest is fine too. Here it's not really either or any. 

So why can't a recommend this one well their a lot.

1. This game is a weird force ghost game were it actually punishes you for playing that way. 

2. Game starts and doesn't stop LYING TO YOU about what your devices do. Examples  wellll THE STUN THAT'S STUN! BATON KILLS PEOPLE. The flash bang 2.0 claims in it's notes it will STUN a group of humans it does not it mildly irritated their eye for a few seconds.

3. The game will actually punish you for trying to ghost it. The game's npc human will just know your there and shot you at many moments, The Alien will just magically know where you are and stay in the area endlessly. The droids are the only enemy that seems to have to active spot you always and that's good because every one of them in the area will know if one does. It gets worse 

4. The game Loves to put you in small 1 or less room areas, tight narrow group of rooms, or otherwise surprise you with enemies. 

5. Jump scares are lazy

Side note The reason i'm writing this is because once again I'm in a single room and from the elevator i came in from one I have to unshackle mind you a human enemy shows up the second you try to turn stuff on again. 

6. God help you if like me your going to a no humans kill run because the game continues to abuse the fact you CAN NOT IN ANYWAY KNOCK OUT HUMAN ENEMIES. Yea you read that right that's why the weapons despite saying they stun don't actually stun. Like i said above lying to you in their info. 

7. related to 6. Now you think ok cool I'm a run an gun and who cares about my ending well issue with that ammo is scarce and those droid take a full 6 round clip any less even in the head and they keep coming. The humans can take one to the head but they also tend to be able to spot and shot you from farther then you can. The alien hahahahaha lets get to 8.

8. HAHAHAHA no! While you may expect it to be a fast lightly armored stealthy killer it instead is a bullet immune,fire resistant, explosive immune juggernaut. Take the pipe bomb it gets hit dead on well it just walks away. Fire the alien traditional weakness it takes the hit and comes right back. Which is an issue with any of the weapons really you never get rid of the alien you just kind of scare it into a vent then it comes right back a few seconds later. Which the worst Part is you can be quieter then a church mouse and that damn thing still finds you every time,  and many times even if you just got off a few level worth of lift or off the train half a mile away from where you left it. The majority of your time in this game will be crawling around waiting for a small window while something (mostly the alien) leaves to move to the next area where you do it again. 

Miscellaneous items. 
           When you start seeing the flaws you start being unable to let other stuff  slide like the medical wing have huge vents in the ceiling everywhere when keeping everything air tight would be a must. Rooms have emergency door close buttons on the inside but not the outside.  Now the why of this is easy the vent so the alien can get in when it shouldn't be able too, the door button so you can't lock the alien or droids in rooms. This adds to a feeling of being railroaded into one play style which the entire game has. Late into the game it gets absurd with this you get to a jail where you have a PC that can open the cells but you can't close them. The Single only reason for this is so you can't throw a noisemaker in that cell and trap the alien. This was this most blatant case 24 hours in but was not the 1st by a long mile. or i suspect the last.

          Is this a bad game no is it a good game %^$ NO! Maybe it will get better later on I will edit this review if it does but this is one part me venting one part hoping to warn others and one part I just plain highly doubt it will get better. Why because I'm 20 or so hours in though a dozen or 2 areas and it's all basically been the same so far."

It would be nice if the Alien ""encounters"" weren't so scripted and point-to-point predictable.
An incredibly massive station, one Alien and Ms. Clippity-Clop over here seems to always attract its attention.

Enemies always know where you are... the Alien always happens to ""follow"" you regardless of how quiet or sneaky you think you are and any distractions you make are temporary as it will simply revert to a predetermined hover-radius around the player to pop out and say hi.

Also... for some reason beyond me... I can't simply pick up the wrench sitting on a toolbox next to me and throw it to cause a distraction..."

I was aware it would be a stalker enemy but I wasn't prepared for the relentless amount this thing is on your *** the entire time once introduced. After several hours of this, it just lead to immense frustration with endless instant deaths and reloads. This in itself wouldn't be nearly as tedious if save points weren't often quite far apart. You can easily find yourself repeating a very careful 10 to 15 minute section several times because of one misstep. I know the game has its fanbase but if this sounds tedious rather than tense to you, save yourself the money. And just to clarify, I didn't play on the hardest setting and/or never play difficult games and therefore just kept losing, that's not the case. The gameplay loop can often devolve into very repetitive cycles of 'xyz is broken or xyz person is ill, go fetch item' and, you guessed it, every time the fetch quest puts you exactly into the area the alien happens to be stalking on this gigantic space station. The absolutely tiniest movement can send the alien into a fit of rage, come charging down an air duct and if you don't immediately interrupt what you were pain-stakingly doing and go hide in a locker, you're toast 9/10.

I know I sound really down about this game but I legitimately loved the first four hours maybe when the other, regular enemy time was the focus. I realize now that was the introduction essentially but again, if the alien would've shown up less constantly, and it is seriously nearly constant, I wouldn't have minded the instant deaths and all and I think it would've been much more effective. As it stands, the alien's presence quickly devolved into transparently repetitive AI cycles, hiding in various furniture that you can't do anything from so you just wait for the alien to stop doing its silly looking circles and overall tedium. 

Aesthetically this is an amazing homage to the first Alien film. It's almost Gothic Horror in space, there's such an air of derelict technology and so, it's just great. The music is amazing, the story is cool fanfic if you're into the series and the graphics, with some tweaks, are quite beautiful especially considering its age. It pains me to dislike this game, it really does. It seemed incredibly promising but the alien, ironically, ruined it for me unfortunately. It's just not well done, mindnumbingly repetitive and irritating instead of scary or tense. 

I wouldn't recommend it unless they do another $2 sale for the beginning hours I guess."

"
836,3,0.3646,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","It's a great game as Alien games go, but it doesn't live up to the hype as a total game experience.  Complicated controls are a poor way to build tension.  All you have to do is remain faithful to the principles established in the source material and you'd have a good game.  Asking the player to hold separate buttons to lift and operate an object is needlessly cumbersome and delivers a hamfisted experience that appeals most directly to juveniles.  I like it for what it is, but I find it more annoying than suspenseful most of the time, so I can't recommend it.  Glad I bought it on sale, but all said, I regret having bought it at all.

The biggest sin the game commits is in the bonus levels where it more or less tramples on the very good storytelling of the source material.  Selecting another person to perform a specific scene was kind of neat from a what-if perspective.  The button fetching and running from point to point felt a little meaningless and doesn't follow the source well, but as a retelling I can get behind it.  But when I'm Dallas in the vents where Dallas in no uncertain terms dies in the vents, I can overlook the alien going buck wild and running all over like they do in the sequel, but when Dallas dies in the scene were everyone knows Dallas is supposed to die and then the game gives you a game over screen, that's poop in the bed chewing with your mouth open wiping your nose on your sleeve over the line unacceptable.  No stars."
837,2,0.5816,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","Beautiful looks, a true hommage to the original Alien saga. But it's not a movie, it's a game, and as such it's terribly lacking.

You need gadget A to open doors of a given type, gadget B for another type, gadget C for another, and so on. Weapons ? rock / paper / scissors. Weapon A will do no good damage to enemies type A but almost none to others. You need weapon B for that. Stealth ? Maybe, if you don't run into a scripted encounter that won't allow it. But sometimes it will require it, too. Cameras ? Yes, you  can shoot them, bash them, or disconnect them from the network using the proper control panel. Except when you can't. This is very reminiscent of the old Thief 3 game, with a patchway lit by torches that you can extinguish with water arrows, and the other with lanterns that you can't extinguish. Play however you want, but take the torch pathway, else you're dead.

The save system is particularly annoying too. You can only save at given locations, and they are quite sparse, so if you die it's easy to miss something because you forget to pick it up again, or don't even remember when you picked it up. Adds some tension to the game, though, so there's that. For instance, I had found a blueprint for a ""noisemaker"". Then died. Then didn't find it again because I probably missed a room.

Could have been a good game if the mechanics didn't suffer from really silly choices that serves no logical purpose but are meant to artificially manufacture tension and a false sense of difficulty and danger. You can't even jump, FFS, meaning some otherwise perfectly valid paths become unusable because... Well, because you're too clumsy to jump. You also have the mandatory flashlight-that-produces-almost-no-light-but-drains-batteries-in-a-matter-of-seconds. And of course the inventory limitations, you can carry 3 items of that type and 5 of that other type, so forget about managing and making tough choices, instead you're going to rant because you can't pick up a 4th tiny ethanol bottle or a 5th charge pack or whatever, even though you have room since you don't have any sensors left.

I haven't mentionned the alien, right ? Well, that's because 3 hours in and into mission 4, I have seen it twice, once in a cinematic, once in a scripted encounter. It was never a threat. Sure, that's not much, but according to that achievement's stats, I've made it further than 50.1% of all people who own that game. Figures.

842,1,0.3623,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","★★★☆☆

I would probably only recommend this game to people who are big fans of the films and or are looking for more [i] Alien [/i] related content. I don't think you would be able to enjoy this anywhere near as much if you hadn't at least seen the first film before going in because as a standalone thing it doesn't really work all that well. I'm about to hate on this game real hard but I actually had fun with it for the most part.

This game looks surprisingly incredible for its age (bar the terrible facial animation) which is why everyone goes on about muh atmosphere and how it looks just like the movies. The attention and detail that went into the overall design [i] is [/i] actually super cool and the atmosphere can be great at times, but it's ruined consistently by the game's asinine writing and endless bugs. Every character in this game has plot armor x1000 until the game decides it's time for them to conveniently die/survive in order to push the plot forward, especially the player character Ripley. Emotional beats consistently fall flat because characters who have had little to no development seem to just keep making increasingly hilarious and irrational choices given the circumstances of what's happening at each point in the story.

In terms of gameplay pretty much the entire game revolves around having to walk to one area to restore power and then walking back to where you came from, except that on the way back there's an alien or androids to avoid. The game does do a good job at keeping you on your toes while not knowing when the alien will show up as you hear it crawl around in the vents, but I believe the frequency of its appearances is affected by the difficulty you choose. I played this game on nightmare difficulty but I'd probably recommend hard as it sounds like it has a better balance of immersion and tedium. Nightmare difficulty has some interesting restrictions that I really liked and that help with the atmosphere, such as not being able to access the map and having super limited resources. On the other hand it makes human enemies hyper aware so they'll snipe you in the foot from across the room which kills you, and it makes the androids an extremely tedious and impassible obstacle unless you're willing to just sit in a room and wait for them to walk their cycle over and over, or somehow cheese their AI. There are opportunities where you can distract them to get past, but these are few and far between and they'll still often deviate from their cycle and spot you while you're spending 10 minutes blow-torching open a vent because the mouse controls are awful. The game's soundtrack doesn't particularly aid in creating or keeping any tension in these moments either, as the music seems to be so hap-hazardly thrown in that it breaks all tension when it loudly cuts in, or there will be entire pivotal scenes that (I think) are meant to be tension filled and or awe-inspiring which are instead completely silent.

I feel that the Alien inherently has the same issue as the androids but on a larger scale due to its design and the fact that it's unkillable, so the only reliable way to avoid it is to just wait behind something where it can't see you until it goes back into the vents which is something you'll figure out after the first few encounters and is totally epic and scary and fun. The SPOILER alleviates this issue somewhat and allows you to move around more freely but at the same time completely breaks the atmosphere and negates most of the tension & fear because it is so good at deterring the alien. The alien also hardcore camps lockers on nightmare, so if you go into one at all it will immediately come and check and you'll be forced into taking health damage from holding your breath, so I think it's best to avoid hiding in lockers at all on this difficulty. Overall the way the alien works seems to be really inconsistent & I don't know if it was due to the difficulty, or if it's inconsistent on all difficulties, but there were points where it would impossibly know where you are and come running from an entirely different room, and times where you could be standing or hiding right in front of it and it wouldn't notice you. The inconsistencies in its behaviour are further exacerbated by the heavily scripted encounters towards the end of the game where it will spawn directly in front of you and spot you no matter what. 

Bugs:
-There's an unfixed mouse issue where unless you move the mouse a large amount your camera in game will hardly move. This apparently can be fixed by enabling adaptive vsync in nvidia control panel.
-Death animations can have no sounds sometimes above 60fps, and almost never do above 100fps. 
-Mouse sensitivity increases tenfold when you're hacking or climbing ladders or in any scripted animation
-The FOV zooms in to the default of 47 when climbing ladders or in vents or in any scripted animation
-The [spoiler] facehugger [/spoiler] jump attack can force pull you towards them through closed doors and will fling your camera around if the game thinks you're close enough to be hit by it, or if it eats your wrench attack. 
-Alien AI can break and it will just walk right up to you and not see you until it decides at a random point that it does actually see you.
- A bunch of other random minor things happened like models disappearing or particles freaking out or out of place sounds etc. Most of the bugs I encountered were super funny and arguably added to the experience because I had other people watching as well

anyway i got this game for 2 bucks and its alright kinda fun(ny)"

I spent way too much time wandering around aimlessly looking for what I need to do next when what I was looking for was an object that is a copy-pasted identical to many other objects in the room. I've been playing games for a long time and am usually pretty observant, but sometimes the objects you need to interact with are just asinine and require you to look up what to do next. If you see the Xenomorph, you're already dead, which may just be a gameplay mechanic, but I don't enjoy it so much, it takes away from how scary the monster is. There would be some anxiety playing the game if I had a chance at escaping the alien, but you don't. When I end up encountering the monster it's just like ""oh darn"", it completely takes away the fear you would feel if you even had a chance at escaping. 
These two things are what I would flat out call bad game design.

The story is bland and also infuriating. The setting is great but the characters are as bland as a white bread sandwich and as I said before, unless you look up a speedrun walkthrough, you'l spend a good portion of your time staring at walls.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, I really enjoyed this game, but not entirely (I enjoyed only about the first half of the game which would be like 4 to 5 hours more or less), the game graphics, atmosphere and ambientation are great and well deserved, but those are the only positive points about this game in my honest opinion, the rest? Just poor and annoying design choices.
Which ones?

Oh boy! Where do I begin?

You are completely worthless: I might understand this is a sort of Shealth-Horror Survival , but you can't kill no one if you want to have a chance at survival (Even with guns!) I haven't really fired my guns because the Alien will sense you, and if you engage fights you will die 100% unless there are plenty of enemies the Alien could kill in the meanwhile.

Gameplay: -Start from A, Go B, Whoops.... you can't pass, go path C. Repeat
                  -Press Crouch,Space and W all game if you want a chance of survival
                  -Unbind Shift, you run? You die
                  -Hide 30 minutes in the same ass closet until Alien goes away
                  -Distract Alien with Noisemaker or Flares or burn it with Molly or Flame... oh wait... you don't have neither of those? Good luck spamming ESC + Load Curent Save until you grind it out with what you have
                  -Oh... I see you made one tiny mistake... it would be a shame if you died, right?

Scavenging: A very important way to win this game is by scavenging resources and crafting utilities that you will make use of in order to lure the Alien in some spots while you do any other thing.In the first 4 to 5 hours of the game you gather and craft most of your resources and feel like God. That's until the first half of the game where you have to use it all for distracting Alien and Humans and have no time for more gathering due to constant pressure (Many would say that's the main point , risking it for resources) No and I will point it below.

Save game stations: They are so far apart that it makes it frustrating to die and your only objective in the second half of the game is to reach them and spam save when possible since you run out of resources and there is no other way to end the game;     -Do action
                                                                    -Save
                                                                    -Do next action
                                                                    -Save
                                                                    -???
                                                                    -Repeat

You didn't save? Well, good luck doing the same thing 5 to 10 times in a row.

The end of the game: Armored Joes and armored groups of humans, one of the last missions involve passing by a hallway surrounded by a group of armored humans (where you can't be stealthy) which implies that you have to run pass them.
It took me a while to figure it about, and I died about 15 to 20 times.

Did I mention already that you run out of resources? Good luck with the grind.

Story: This guy dies!, and this one! Why don't this one? this one too!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Want to play it? Play the first half and then leave it, your journey is done.
Would I recommend it for it's price? For 35€ No, for 2€ again, perhaps.
Want a good survival horror game? Play Dead Space

853,1,0.4018,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","My first two hours:

Game glitched on mission 0. Apparently, sometimes the game soft-locks and doesn't let you progress unless you talk with Taylor BEFORE getting dressed and talking to Samuel.

Lighting is baked, rather than realtime. Not sure what that's about. Seems pretty integral to a game about Ridley Scott's Alien, but I guess it could've been in the settings somewhere.

Computer consoles have artificial loading screens and an interface that hinders conveyance. Had to watch a guide to learn how to turn on the power initially.

The game is extremely linear so far, and the gameplay has no variety. You just find switches to open doors in each area. The cutscenes are cool, but the story is mostly told through audio logs, like in Bioshock. You also transition to new levels via a tram like, you know, in Bioshock 2. Actually, this game is basically Bioshock with very limited weapons.

The crafting system is easy and satisfying to use.

There's a 20-minute Call of Duty-esque ""follow random character"" section, which was pretty lame.

The music and atmosphere are great, but that's because they're taken directly from the original film. The NPCs have slow animations, during which they can't track your character to keep facing you during conversations. The characters in this game feel wooden, again, like in a Call of Duty campaign.

Basically, this game's a tutorial for at least the first two hours. I have no problem with slow pacing; some of my favorite movies are Alien (obviously), 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Stalker. However, this game doesn't have any content. Nothing's happening for those two hours. It's not so much that things are happening slowly, as that things aren't happening at all. The plot's moving forward, but I haven't actually done anything gameplay-wise beyond flipping switches to open doors, doing QTEs with a wrench to open other doors, and snuck by a group of NPCs in the most lazily-implemented stealth sequence I've ever seen outside of Modern Warfare. All Ghillied Up is from 2007. Did Sega really learn nothing about game development since then? I know this is just a tutorial section that's meant to teach me about mechanics that will, ostensibly, get better later in the game, but I've spent most of my playtime practicing how to walk around and press the 'E' key.


TL;DR
This game is barely more than a walking simulator for the first two hours. Unless you have a lot of discretionary time and patience, don't bother."
854,1,0.5648,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","After a few hours of restoring power to open doors, looking in the dark for items, and then  getting a small taste of lurking around to avoid being detected by enemies, I uninstalled. Life is too short for this unless you already know you prefer non-action suspense and atmospheric titles.

2 hours in, I was regretting using up HD space to even install this (let alone buying it) after so much time wandering around. Finally an alien killed me and I got past a few more checkpoints to see what the game was offering, and decided not to get invested. IMO, decide if you enjoy primarily atmospheric games before spending money on this."
855,3,0.3107,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing",This game is worth exactly what I paid for it: $2.
856,2,0.5178,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level",Not enough loot on nightmare mode
857,1,0.6913,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I love stealth games, but this is a repetative mess that relies on jump scares. The alien doesn't move on if it can't find you; it'll keep patrolling the area and will eventually find you even if you're hiding. 

Every time you need to go through a door, it's locked. You'll have to hunt down a keycard, passcode, or turn on a noisy generator to get it open.

The characters are garbage. The pace is frustrating and the save points are too far apart. 

I bought this for $2 and am still annoyed."
858,1,0.6503,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","The AI in this game was touted to be revolutionary and ""terrifying."" It certainly is, but it's not as impressive as I thought it was said to be. I had heard that the enemies are programmed to track you, follow you, anticipate your next move, even set up ambushes for you - it certainly feels that way, but after playing through the first few chapters, I can say with confidence that the AI doesn't quite live up to the reputation, and here's why: they already know where you are; they're just programmed to ignore you until you do something that they can't ignore. When you're hiding behind cover or sitting in a vent, the enemies will be looking directly at you, but will do nothing. They will turn around to look in your general direction, sometimes even make eye-contact with you, but because the game tells them ""player incognito,"" they won't try to attack you. It's obvious that they know where you are, but their scripts don't allow them to do anything about it other than look at you. After I came to that conclusion, the game just became frustrating because I was trying to avoid all sight lines with the androids, but couldn't, and ended up taking stupid risks and hail-mary maneuvers to get around them - only to realize later that even though they looked right at me, thought that there was no way they didn't see me, they ignored me anyway. Maybe I just haven't found the right way to anticipate the enemies' behavior yet, but it was totally not what I expected. Not a huge let-down, but I was disappointed nonetheless."
859,3,0.6096,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Not worth it even with this big discount, I ve played for 7 hours then decided to uninstall it after realizing that it is really very difficult to play"
860,1,0.3777,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I don't know where all the rave reviews are coming from, but after spending a couple hours in the game, there's obviously a lot of critical issues that spoil the experience. 

[b]Background[/b]: Enjoyed the Alien movies and some older AvP games
[b]Difficulty[/b]: Hard
[b]Completion[/b]: done with this shit

Let's get the technical issues out of the way:

- The windows port is not for PC, it's for a controller (even though they were released together? + Triple A studio?)
- The radial menu and UI is all built around a controller, it's counter-intuitive and frustrating to navigate with a mouse and keyboard. Hell, you can't get past the splash screen with a mouse, ""pReSS aNY kEy""
- Game looks blurry due to the type of AA introduced, not sure if it's a console port issue

[u]Good Stuff:[/u]

- Killer sound design
- Atmosphere is the only reason to buy this game
- Characters are very fleshed out 
- Great level design (questionable at times)

[u]Bad Stuff:[/u] 

I'm going to address the elephant in the room that I find hard to ignore: It's a buggy mess. The longer I played, the worse it seemed to get and the frustration only built upon these findings. 

Examples:

- Slow-motion bug from the very first mission all the way through the first cutscene 
- When using the save box or any tool/keycard/hack device, mouse sensitivity skyrockets
- When entering vents or performing certain actions, FoV changes to default then back to user settings
- Flamethrower fuel tank can apparently attach to your feet while walking, nice sloshing shoes bro
- Alien can get bugged, stands in a hallway just looking at you or gets stuck running into a chair
- If the Alien is in a charge animation, nothing will stop it from performing an instant grab 95% of the time
- If the Alien is in some custom scripted animation, it's invulnerable 
- Alien ignores other NPCs shooting and goes straight for you unless they're directly in its path
- NPCs ignore the Alien and shoot you instead (hello? there's a big ******* Alien in front of you, who's the bigger threat?)
- Android on the floor unable to be looted? He's alive waiting to grab on me! Better kill it! Oh wait, you can't and can only let yourself get grabbed by walking out of the trigger zone
- Androids in animation (e.g getting up) are unable to be hit 
- TWO Pipe bombs, with explosions equivalent to grenades, are required to kill Androids with flimsy rubber hazard suits? They don't even flinch from the first bomb how the hell would anyone know to throw a second, especially considering how many resources it takes to craft them (I had to google this)
- Flashbangs don't work when they should at point blank (same enemy, two different results on two different saves?)
- Shooting an NPC while he's flashed removes the flashed status
- In one particular mission, human NPC enemies bug out at the top of a landing and stay frozen 
- Stun Baton range is inconsistent, sometimes it misses at point blank sometimes it hits
- Getting hit by Androids while using a terminal/wire terminal doesn't interrupt your interaction (arguably has positives but you still take damage)

[u]Gameplay:[/u]

Some huge design issues I have with this game, one being the looting system. When I loot a crate, why do I have to press a key to quit looting it? Why can't I just walk away to close the menu? And why do I have to pick individual items at all? I NEED ALL OF IT. How does something basic like this not get brought up during development or QA?

The game forces stealth down your throat when it doesn't work half the time. Why waste time hiding and dying ten times to stupid shit when I could just rush the objective, take a bit of damage and get out? This thought process applied to way more scenarios than I wanted to after getting frustrated on certain missions.

The AI scripted for Alien is that it'll always patrol the area you're in regardless of it seeing you or not. The game wants you to believe that the Alien is ""smart"" but it's the stupidest shit I've seen in awhile. Sure, you could wait in a locker for 10 hours and guess what? The Alien is STILL PATROLLING YOUR AREA. This concept alone makes this game a frustrating mess to complete and almost a chore to get to the next level because of the all-knowing PERFECT BEING.

In conjunction with this, it spoils the player's desire to explore or read terminal messages. The map is technically ""open world"" with the ability to traverse back to old locations but with this dumbass Alien always following you, what's the point of checking every place for loot when the safest plan is to finish all main objectives as fast as possible so the Alien doesn't eat my ass? In order to enjoy the great writing that went into some of the terminal notes, I ended up pausing the game just to read them rather than risk getting ambushed while doing so in real-time.

- Hiding in anything but a locker or cabinet is useless
- What's the point of having spaces under tables or objects in the map that can be ""hid"" under and not have them work?
- The flamethrower works, sometimes - a tiny squirt to flinch the Alien, rinse and repeat till he runs up a vent
- Every item other than the medkit is pointless until you finish about 75% of the game
- There's no combat, don't kid yourself
- Save machine detecting enemies nearby? Just save that shit. 
    - The game dynamically loads enemies away from the save box to prevent infinite death loops or perhaps just getting sued
- When you sprint, the whole world hears you (it's better than the noisemaker tbh and it's FREE)
    - It triggers the Alien (literally) and any other enemies on the entire map
    - It's only use is for outrunning androids and from getting to the previous place you died from an old save, only to realize 
       enemies are dynamically spawned and you just triggered them from the start of your old save

[u]Conclusion:[/u]

I'm not sure what to say about this game. I really wanted to like it, but it's almost as if the bigwigs at Fox gave the development studio a blank check to make this game without even checking if they knew HOW to make a horror game. It could have been so much better. 

If you're a hardcore Alien fan or interested in the story, go for it. For everyone else, wait for a sale.

The atmosphere and retro-futuristic style is so well done I would have forgiven some minor problems in gameplay but this is just... tedious.  I have played and enjoyed similar games (like SOMA and Amnesia) and understand that you aren't supposed to be Doomguy blasting through the hallways.  Played it with the proper stealth and patience (at first) but was still sadly let down.  Disappointing because I looked forward to this one for a long time.
863,3,0.5187,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This game is a chore.
Literally only the first 4 or so hours are enjoyable. Then it becomes a big chore since something goes wrong in every mission and you have to do A,B,C and D in order to progress. 
Also, sometimes you have to solve a series of puzzles while going slow as hell because the Alien will hear you.
The levels feel also super recycled as you return to them 2-3 times in what seems an inorganic way of extending the game.

If this game goes on sale again, sure, buy it. But that's the only way I can recommend it."

Im sorry this is folly..."
869,2,0.5661,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","It's not what it's made out to be. The AI director feeds the alien your location all the time. It doesn't matter how good you are at avoiding his attention. He will find you no matter what, and stay close to you. This is true even in medium to large levels. This kind of design ignores player performance for what feels like cheesy and cheap tactics to keep the threat close to you. This to me is the main issue with Alien Isolation, a game-breaking one. It defeats the main premise of the game, to hide from the Alien while trying to do various jobs to escape the ship, because it will always know EXACTLY where you are. What's the point of hiding then? There is no point.

Other issues include repetitive gameplay, an uninspired story, weak voice acting, reliance on player-deaths to teach the game.

Perhaps the biggest achievement of Alien Isolation is inspiring the Biohazard team over at Capcom with ideas how to reboot the Resident Evil franchise, leading to Resident Evil 7, which outsold Alien Isolation over 10 times. Because at its core Alien Isolation had good ideas, which never manifested their potential in the hands of Creative Assembly."

The pissy AI robot dudes just slowly walk after you reading off a brochure or something. Anyway you quick time event mash button, pull lever, adjust knobs, turn wrench, cut panel just to get to the next area where you tap alien 3 times with a flame thrower, get punched in the asshole by the robots slowly walking behind you only to discover....another room where you have to turn a wrench, pull a lever, recover a painting of a lost grandmother followed by mixing your favorite cocktail and finally pushing 3 buttons in a sequence that isn't even a puzzle, it's just...push these buttons. Go ahead, push em BOOM ALIEN HEARD IT NOW U TAP HIM 3 TIMES WITH A FLAME THROWER, next room......for like ~10 hours. it's a 3 hour game that got stretched out to about 10-15 hours to justify their $40 ACTUAL AMERICAN US DOLLARS price tag.

The atmosphere and graphics are amazing. The sound design is incredible and you really do feel as if you're trapped with a killer alien on a space station. I also loved how seamlessly the building materials and maps are put into the environment.

Some of my favorite parts of this game come from the intense feeling you get trying to hack a computer with a loud beeping square while you hear a giant killer alien stomping through the vents to make your innards a delicious snack. 

Now my issue with the game is how tedious and drawn out the game is. The game just goes on and on and on and on. It became frustrating to a point where I was glad the game was finally over. This constant game play design of dragging you back just to go through the same areas again felt cheap and unrewarding. Especially towards the end of the game.

With that said, I do believe this is a great game but it falls short of being enjoyable for me. Now I want state I did play the game on ""Hard"" so some of my frustration can be credited to the difficulty.

The game is just simple on annoying. I've been playing it 12 hours and it been extremely frustrating at points, not ""horroristic"" at any point now anymore.

TL;DR: If you didn't buy this game for $2 or your regional equivalent, you got ripped off. Unless you're a hardcore Alien fan, a complete newcomer to the Stealth genre, or just really enjoy Fetch quests, this game isn't for you. Too much of the game is spent putting you in the Alien universe and not enough of it was spent actually making a good game.

Either buy it on sale less than $20 and that's being generous, or don't buy it at all and spent your money on an actual horror game.
.
.
Let me just begin with what I know the game does right, because it's very good at what it does.
[h1] The Atmosphere [/h1]
I got it; this game does an immense amount of work trying to put you in the Alien universe. The mechanics, the tight corridors and ventilation, the lore, even the smallest details have been painstakingly put into this game in order to put you within the setting and I appreciate it 100%. This game is an Alien fan's wet dream and if you're buying this game just for that, I cannot blame you at all.

[h1] The Alien [/h1]
Not gonna lie, the Alien is pretty good, not amazing, but pretty dern good. While they were few and far between, I did get some intense moments of hiding in a locker or under a desk waiting for it to leave the room and it painfully checks the room for where I am. It's a nice addition to the game, and it's much appreciated as even when it wasn't in the room it made some of the duller moments of the game have a bit more tension.
-------------------------------------------------
Now I will say that I played this game on the Normal difficulty setting and I understand that some of the gameplay issues could've been resolved within the higher difficulties. Normal should be the average baseline of what a game should have to offer and what I received wasn't very good, often dull, tedious, and just flat out boring. I doubt a single difficulty spike would fix this and I would probably have to jump to Nightmare mode, the hardest difficulty setting, to get the experience I was anticipating.

Regardless, I think the best way to explain my frustration with the game is to just remove the Alien from our view for the moment and take a look at everything else the game has to offer. Lets start with the characters:

[h1] The Characters / The Story [/h1]
 I love characters and I personally believe that any good narrative lives or dies by it's characters. This game does not have characters, it has 3D models resembling human beings reading a script in a sound booth. Anybody with more than like 2 lines to read has absolutely zero emotion within their voice to the point where I started making jokes that they were actually just androids and didn't understand the concept of human emotion, I won't spoil who it is, but I was actually right in one case. The only character that had any semblance of passion in their voice was Ripley, thank god because you control her, but half of the time she's understandably whispering as to not alert the Alien so it comes off as more comical than actually tense and emotional.

Moving onto the story and I think this is the fault of the poor character writing, it's bland. You enter the station trying to find out more information about Ripley's mother who went missing years prior. That plot ends quickly and now you're just trying to get off. There's probably more too it and obviously I'm summarizing heavily, but I just flat out lack the investment to pay any attention to what these guys are saying half the time. It really says something when the lore hidden in the computers and the environment is more interesting than the literal plot happening before my eyes. At that point you might as well just read a book.

[h1] The Gameplay [/h1]
I think I described it very well in my TL;DR, but in an effort to expand it. You are doing Fetch Quests the entire time. 

Go to this part of the station, grab this thing, come back. We need to trap the Alien in this section, do these things and then come back. Whoops, it got out, we now need you to go here and do it again. I'm 5 hours into this game and all I've done is do fetch quests and walk. That's also not to mention the myriad of save points ALL OVER the place. If this doesn't kill any tension within the game then I don't know what will other than the Alien wearing squeaky shoes.

This game has what looks like combat, but in reality there is no combat in this game. The Alien can oneshot you 95% of the time so you're sure as hell not fighting that and if you fight almost anybody else, including the humans and androids, the Alien will hear it and will come out to eat your a$$. So combat does not exist unless using the humans as live bait and alerting Alien to your location interests you.

Stealth is basically all you're doing in game. Hardly any of the humans are friendly, which doesn't make any sense considering there are hostile androids and a f*cking Alien trying to kill you, but okay. You're peeking around corners, going through vents, not running, blah blah. You get it. The stealth isn't bad, but it's just not interesting. If you can help it, don't interact with anything and you'll be fine.

You have tools and gadgets to help you on your journey, but as I said earlier, I am playing on Normal difficulty and outside of medkits because the game for some reason thinks it's okay to rob you of HP during cutscenes, I have not used a single one of them. I'd imagine playing on Nightmare would require these tools, but yeah you get the picture. You need medkits and the eventual Flamethrower you get, that's about it.

In short, this game is you trying to do grunt work with an Alien potentially trying to kill you 24/7.
.
.
You get the picture, it's not a fun experience so far, and while I will finish it just for the sake of doing so, I doubt I'll ever playthrough it again as it's just so painstakingly slow. If you like Alien then yeah, of course pick this up, but if you're looking for a genuine horror experience, outside of the hardest difficulty this ain't it chief."

This is just too much repetition of the same old hide move hide move hide move'. The logic and reasoning behind so many encounters with 'aliens' - feels like there is always one 10 feet from you, can barely move a couple of rooms before encountering more - least it feels that way - sorry just couldn't get into this one.

Far too much poorly scripted AI almost see through walls type nonsense, this was more grind than entertainment, doubt I'll be playing it again."

From the beginning 20th Century Fox intro to the details in the atmosphere while playing in-game, it's truly awe-inspiring production and stressful gameplay that few horror games can match. The cat-and-mouse game with the Alien gives you the right amount of uncertainly that makes you safe, but will punish you if you try to repeat a hiding method one too many times. It's everything you'd want after seeing the movie [i]Alien[/i].

So what's wrong? The game length. It would have been perfect 6-8 hour experience (minus the time spent dying and reaching your point of death again), but this game just goes on, and on, and on, and [b]ON[/b]. It wouldn't be much of an issue if new gameplay dynamics or new mission structures were introduced. Unfortunately, what you see from the start is what you'll get to the end. That is, go to a destination, avoid enemies, activate buttons/switches, find out it didn't work, and repeat this structure for the next objective.

Warning (Vague spoiler):  [spoiler]Don't be surprised if when you think the end is near, you'll be reminded that you failed [b]again[/b] and there's more objectives to complete.[/spoiler]

And the last mission... (Spoiler):  [spoiler]If the amount of time spent wasn't enough already, the game has you covered. The mission structure of walking to get a spacesuit, triggering scenes of Ripley constantly avoiding near-death scenarios, is so tedious that you'll think it's FINALLY all over. Nope. One more scripted scene, and then you're free.[/spoiler]

Overall, It's a great 5-7 hour experience that drags for 12+ hours. It's a defining example of too much of a good thing. If you have lots of free time and don't mind going from point-to-point hours on end, go for it. Otherwise, consider whether your time better spent elsewhere or go watch [i]Alien[/i] and [i]Aliens[/i]."

After hiding in an area for 5 minutes (chapter 3), too worried it'd spot me for moving 1 inch after 10 failed attempts I started to realize the game makes me feel like I can't progress and it got very frustrating. It would find me after hiding too long while making no noise. I know it's supposed to make me progress in the game and tell me that hiding for too long is a bad thing but why shouldn't I be able to do that if I feel it's unsafe?

After attempting to do the area a bunch more times and finally completing it I said it wasn't worth it. If I was given the flamethrower early on instead of half way through I'd feel the game gives me more of an ability to progress but since I felt stuck I don't recommend it. Immersion was lost when the alien kept patrolling the same area for 10 minutes looking for what seems to be nobody after hiding for so long and that's another factor I in the ""no."""

The only good thing about this game is the visual design. The station and ships are beautifully made, in a visual style very reminiscent of the movies. But this is not enough to make a good game. It is only enough to sell it.

This game supposedly have a very sophisticated AI for the Alien. It will become readily evident that this was just a marketing lie. There is no AI at all, only pre-recorded and scenarized encounters with the Alien. At first, he'll be inoffensive, and won't even notice you even if you stand right in front of him. Then, gradually, he'll take more heed of you as you progress in the game. They would let you believe that he's ""learning"". But it soon become evident that the Alien behaviour changes only depending on the level you're in. And the more you play, the more it is evident that the ""sophisticated AI never seen before"" is just after all a random behaviour. The Alien is dangerous and intelligent only as long as you're willing to believe it is. Once you understand the way the AI works, it become really boring.

Should you buy it? No.

It's a 15 hour game that could've easily been cut to 6-8 hours in length. It includes nothing but filler content that becomes incredibly tedious and boring towards the end, making you question ""why tf is this game still going? The game should've ended hours ago"". Honestly, it is so painful to get through. Even the ending has these QTE moments which are so out of place and looks ridiculous as both the player and alien completely come to a freeze, just to wait for you to push the QTE button.

The game always follows the same formula of...
""Activate this, restore power, go here, go there. Repeat""

Also, the AI is terrible and is incredibly overrated, it mainly consists of people over-exaggerating how great it is because a couple of reviewers said so. 
- Pick up essential objective item, Alien then spawns in the level and roams the area until you hide in a locker. At that point he'll jump in the vents and not come back until you exit the locker. Even if you don't move after exiting the locker, he'll come back and roam the area because the game script tells him to do so.
- AI is blind sometimes.
- Each playthrough is the same, he's scripted to roam certain areas and this won't change with each playthrough you do.
- Alien doesn't react to other humans talking on the ship.


First quarter of this game is great, visuals are fantastic, atmosphere is perfect, but the majority of the game is just a letdown.

NO.  I cannot recommend this game.  If you're looking for critique here it is:

1)  The save points are purposefully scattered very far apart.  This has a dual effect---it creates tension, but it also creates FRUSTRATION.

2)  Interacting with objects/game environment becomes (and stays) a chore---click, click...just pick it up!

3)  There are MANY, MANY, parts in the game where you are given no chance and no ostensible direction on what to do.  This also has a dual purpose.  On one hand it helps create tension via confusion.  On the other hand it's downright frustrating to wander around and die by smoke inhalation.  (Hint, there's a ladder to climb.  You're welcome!)  This might be the main killer of this game and is the root cause of critique #4.

4)  Game drags on and becomes a chore.  This game simply just goes on and on.  After the 15th hour, I thought, ""Ok, anytime now"".  After 20 hours, I was just tired of playing it.  It's a classic example of getting too far invested with time and therefore you can't stop.  Not because it's addictive.  Because you've spent a ton of time and effort and now you've GOT to beat the damn thing.    

I would be tempted to rename this game, Alien:  Isofrustration.  Or, alternatively:  Alien:  A$$hole-ation  Or, if you like chores and work in your games, Alien:  Obligation."

The ""unpredictable alien"" mod make it less awful but only a little. The alien is still totally aware of your position while also very bad at actually spotting you, but at least he go away long enough for you to be surprised when he pop up again."
966,1,0.4656,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","The fact that this game has widespread acclaim and appears is most ""best horror games"" lists shows that is a good game. It's just not for everyone. Even playing in easier difficulties, you will spend too much time waiting inside a locker or under a table. You stick you head off a little bit, oh, here comes the alien again, more time under the table. Let's try this time, huh? Ok, another table, more time waiting. Tired of waiting too much? Sorry, the alien saw you. You are dead, nothing to do about it. Rinse and repeat. Since the alien behavior is randomized (which, to be fair, is a great and creative asset), you cannot simply learn from the mistakes, and luck plays a big role. And patience. Lots of patience. Most people seem to find this kind of playing great and terrifying. I'm on the other camp, it's just boring and takes all horror out of the experience.

There would be a very simple fix for people like me: a quicksave button. Manage to dodge the enemies and found another table to hide? Nice, time to save and try to reach the next one. You may still die a lot, but at least you lose less time. It prevents artificially inflating an alredy long game. Again, most people seem to think this ruins the survival experience. Good for them, but you may simply not use quicksaving. I just wish we had the option.

ps: there is a mod that disables completely the alien. You may try it if you really want to experience the story. But it turns whole sequences into simple walking adventures."
967,2,0.5138,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","I completed the second half of Mission 4 after dying repeatedly for 2 hours and cursing out the game mechanics. Out of curiosity, I checked how many missions were remaining; I was shocked to discover that I had only completed 30% of the game. I first started playing Alien Isolation in October 2017. It is now the end of March 2020. Getting to this point was like pulling teeth. I ended my most recent session feeling like I wasn’t having fun. Consequently, I decided to shelve the game and move on.

I will concede that Alien Isolation succeeds in building atmosphere. The sound design was excellent, from the creaking of the ship to the banging of the vents as the Alien stalked Ripley. My heart beat faster every time the music changed to danger mode. The voice acting was good, and cinematic sequences were well done. They made me look forward to the beginning of each new Mission (chapter). Unfortunately, my excitement was replaced by frustration as I repeatedly died at the hands of enemies—human, Alien, and Android alike—despite knowing what I was supposed to do from a technical standpoint! For a stealth game, Alien Isolation’s buggy mechanics don’t really encourage stealth play. 

Humans and Androids lingered too long in one spot in relation to other patrolling enemies. I was frequently caught from behind while waiting for the enemy in front of me to move. On Mission 4, I died and crouched behind crates from the start of the patrol sequence. It was business as usual until the Android suddenly turned around to murder me while I was stationary and hiding. WTF? Okay, no biggie, I can use a noisemaker this time… Wait, why is the noisemaker attracting all other enemies except for the one blocking my path?

Success with the noisemaker varied. I’ve had it work as intended, I’ve had an Android ignore it, and I’ve had an Android inspect it before making a U-turn to come murder me while I hid, crouched in the hallway. I felt like I had no other choice than to hold down Shift and cheese my way past all the enemies I had alerted. I threw a smoke bomb behind me and slammed on the elevator door.

The stealth options were plain dumb when the game pushed you to crouch and move directly behind an enemy. I vaguely remember doing this in an early Mission with the first wave of human enemies. In Mission 4, [spoiler] there is a part where you have to sneak past an Android. But if you go to the obvious left, the Alien could be waiting to gobble you up. I knew it was there when I saw ropes of saliva dripping through the vent. It made no sense that the Android couldn’t hear me shuffling around behind it’s butt (to avoid the Alien), and yet it was the only working option. [/spoiler]

Puzzles were a little too easy. In Mission 4, the communication override puzzles involved [spoiler] matching numbers clearly displayed on the screen and selecting highlighted numbers within a generous time window [/spoiler]. An elementary school student could figure it out, although I hope that none are playing this scary game! Understandably, the stealth-related puzzles (changing ship settings) had to be simpler due to the pressure of avoiding enemy patrols.

I don't mind the jump scares. They make sense to me in the context of the story: you’re stuck on a huge ship, surrounded by different enemies and a literal alien predator feasting on everyone aboard. It only gets old when the game mechanics trap you into alerting enemies, e.g. ultimately ending in death. Obviously, getting caught by enemies from behind falls under this category. But Mission 4 actually had a cheap jump scare/unavoidable death close to the end of it. [spoiler]I walked towards some loot in the Reception area behind the circular desk. An Android strewn across the floor got up behind me and cut to the death scene.[/spoiler] There wasn’t even a Quick Time Event to repel the enemy! I spammed the action button in vain, and I was forced to re-do the patrol sequence yet again."

Extremely linear, the prompts to do necessary things are finnicky, like you have to be exactly in the position and location the game wants in order for it to offer for you to interact with the object.

This is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played
-the character is slow
-the controls are not intuitive
-the characters reaction to everything is delayed and there is no time to heal/change weapons between assaults
-I often found myself between a dead end and the alien, synth or human attacker
-the map is beyond confusing and frustrating as you are given vague instructions/directions and often misleading information. “find the elevator” they said…. “Which elevator!?”
-find yourself pacing back and forth through more of the same, confusing environments in every level only to be repeatedly ambushed.
-there is no jump feature for the character. This shouldn’t bother me, but it really does. This is just another reason why this character is so frustrating and awful; their range of movement is not at all similar to a person being chased by a killer alien.
-the game re-equipped my pistol or hand tool after every elevator ride or load, so I had to remember to re-equip my flamethrower often (this was very frustrating)
-save times at terminals are so lengthy, no sense of relief when saving the game, only pure panic.
-if you love getting shanked in the face while you’re trying to decode alien locks and hack terminals then this would be a great game for you.
-if you love failing over and over and over again until you crack down and read walkthroughs for every level then this is the game for you.
-if you love games that make even the simplest of tasks painstakingly lengthy and frustrating… oh boy!
-the only pros to this game are that the story is mildly intriguing, and the visuals are great. I liked being scared from time to time and getting sneak peeks of the alien as I navigated the first few levels…. But it just gets so tiring and frustrating after multiple, unnecessarily complicated mechanics."

[b] Positives: [/b]
-The atmosphere was probably the best aspect of the game, you feel very alone and helpless most of the time. I like the visuals and the style of the space station. It feels connected the Alien universe while being its own thing.
-mechanically the gameplay is pretty good, I have a few issues with input but overall it was good. Same can be said about overall performance. If you told me this was made in 2019 I would believe it.
-Voice acting is mostly good.

[b] Stuff I didn't like. [/b]
-First and worst of all, this game is WAY too long. Thats typically not something someone would complain about in any other game, but this game is pretty slow paced so you really feel the runtime. I thought this game was about to wrap up around hour 12-ish but it kept going. Almost all aspects of this game would have been so much better if it 5 or even 10 hours shorter. The gameplay also suffers from this a lot as a lot it just feels stale after a while.

-The story was okay at best, but I really didn't care about the characters or what was going on. The plot is very typical of the Alien franchise and doesn't feel like it adds anything to the universe. Cooler aspects like Atlas and Weyland Utani's involvement were the most interesting parts but were really underdeveloped. 

-The plot is really meandering and aimless. 90% of the game is just fetch questions that go wrong, leading to more fetch quests. And it all amounts to a really anticlimactic ending. The dialogue and additional lore bits weren't very well written, like emails you read don't feel like they were written by actual people.

-Getting into gameplay, the worst thing was getting killed a lot for absolutely no good reason. Half the time I never felt like it was my fault I died. After a while the alien / Joes killing you just gets annoying and isn't scary at all. The setpieces are all largely the same froma  gameplay perspective, with a few exceptions. I felt like a lot of the encounters with the alien could have been more creative.

-Stealth was pretty good, although enemy A.I. didn't feel very realistic, I always felt like I has hiding from A.I. instead of an Alien which was immersion breaking. After a while it just gets stale. The most fun I had with this game was when the alien isn't a factor and you're just playing around Working Joes. You feel like you're being more tactful and using your items way more. I wished the rest of the game emulated that feeling.

-The soundtrack is well produced, but its just another manipulative horror soundtrack. Some settings would have benifited from being silent. instead you're assulted with cliche horror movie screeching violins and sounds that are supposed to sound like the alien. Its just way too much. In hindsight I wish i had played with the music off, and I would reccomend doing so if you feel like this is an aspect you wouldn't like.

[b] Conclusion [/b] 
This an interesting game but ultimately just overstays its welcome. I love the Alien universe but this entry dissapointed me."
980,3,0.6479,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Another good game killed by it's ending...

Don't get me wrong - I would recommend the game ... just ... don't finish it"
981,2,0.3826,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","This is a tough one, because I don't like stealth games, which means it can be hard to tell if a game is bad, or if I'm just impatient with the amount of time it expects me to squat under a table while the AI patrols. But this is quite bad. The story is...just the same great beats from Alien, ad nauseum. Oh, the alien is revealing itself and murdering somebody again, how jaw-dropping. The gameplay is garbage. Laborious crafting, excessively long interactions with the environment, a frustrating map, and a score and controller vibration pattern that is specially designed to make you both wet yourself and dread having to do anything. The idea that every human on the station has just descended into savagery to the point where they don't even have an interest in a new arrival is laughable. 
I guess it boils down to the following: games based off other franchises either really think about their themes and carve a new niche, like Shadow of Mordor or Arkham Asylum, or they just try and be as close to the original experience as possible. This game is pretty close to the original experience of watching Alien - only longer, harder, and less emotionally cathartic. Some people will and have called this high art, but I was underwhelmed in the extreme."
982,3,0.7505,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","DISCLAIMER: DO NOT PLAY ON HARDEST DIFFICULTY

I did not hate this game, but it was heavily repetitive and the animations were broken at times. The reason I do not recommend on the hardest difficulty is because it becomes reliant on luck rather than trying to actually complete the game.

If you're a fan of the Alien series, it's a fun nod, but really not scary as much as it is an interactive museum. I wouldn't say I'm going to remember 90% of the game, and the ending didn't give me much satisfaction aside from the fact I don't need to play it again.

Overall: 6/10"
983,1,0.4783,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","The general idea of making a stealthy Alien game was good. Too bad it ended up being a boring mess. I wanted to uninstall it like four times to play something more interesting, but I forced myself to finish it in hope of getting a cool ending. The game starts in a fun way, because it had a good atmosphere, which reminded me of the movies with the setting. I like the old technology that was similar to the original tech from the movies. It also looks and sounds nice. There was tension, because I was waiting for the Alien to show up at any time randomly. Then, when it finally showed up, the game became boring. The reason is that there was no tension anymore. At the beginning, while I was waiting for it and didn't know when or where would it appear, it was cool, but after you meet it, it shows up everywhere all the time wherever you go. There is no tension anymore, because you know that it will appear in pretty much every single room you step into. I think this would work much better if the Alien showed up more randomly and not all the time. It's almost always there with you and that simply makes the game tedious. The Alien itself is also not scary, it either just walks around like a normal enemy, or crawls around in the vents. It doesn't do anything else. You can't run away, you can't fight it, you can't fight others either because it will hear the attack. The only way to play this game successfully is to use stealth. I love stealth games, but the Alien has no clear pattern, it walks around randomly, so it's hard to be stealthy sometimes, because if it notices you, you are dead. There aren't enough save points at some parts so you might repeat the same parts over and over and sometimes it's not even your fault. One thing I kind of liked was the scanner which is supposed to show if there are any enemies around, but I found it funny when I saw that the Alien happens to teleport sometimes. It was around me in the vents in a second, then disappeared and ended up being somewhere else in the other second without the scanner showing it crawling away. My favorite was the one time, when I made my way back to a save point using stealth during a long section and the Alien wasn't near me on my scanner, then, right before I turned at the corner and saw the save point, it jumped down right behind me and killed me. It's not scary or tense, it's just annoying. My next problem is that the characters are boring, I didn't care about anyone at all. Main chara is supposed to be an engineer, yet all she can do is pulling levers in several ways. I almost forgot that she can also push buttons. Fascinating. I don't like crafting in games in general, so I didn't like it here either. The story is meh, the game shows nothing new, it mostly just copies everything from the movies without any original idea, so I didn't feel interested. This also shows from the fact that main chara is Ripley's kid, so whenever somebody talks to you, they call you Ripley, and you start wondering why can't you play as the original Ripley who was capable of more than pushing buttons. The game's also too long. The devs simply didn't know when to stop and I was getting annoyed after some time, because whenever I felt like ""Ok, maybe this is the ending"", something else happened to make it even longer, when it wasn't necessary, and it ends up being a mess thanks to that. I didn't care about anything that happened after some time. There are some cool moments, sure, but I didn't find the game entertaining and I don't think it's worth the full price. Yet, if you are a huge Alien fan and enjoy this kind of gameplay, you may enjoy it more than I did."

The surface is a thin ice with this game. It does do wonders for the senses, and even has some scary and tense moments in the beginning of the game. The extremely linear story line and mechanics of the game a are shadow of its beautiful visage. This game is a clunky, linear, slow, non-combative stealth game. The alien is invulnerable, you can't kill it, not with bullets, explosives, or anything cool that you can come up with. All you can do is hide. Hide like a b*tch. If you distract the alien and go the opposite way, it just winds up in the same room as you again, walking by you ever so slow....again. The alien isnt even an enemy at this point, its more like an obstacle that is no longer scary. The androids are laughable and annoying. The humans are sad as well to fight, overly predictable, as if they have similar pathing from the androids. But really, the only thing that got me to play so many hours was the hope this game would get better as I progressed. Nope. I cant bring myself to load it up again finish the last two missions. Why? I shouldn't play 16/18 missions and be in agony. 

You do know that you have the Alien franchise name and rights? This was like a star wars film with zero jedi and no force powers. Its just a stupid space movie with ineffective weapons. Its sad to watch and play. Let me fight an alien or two. Let me lure an alien to a place where I can blow it up and its blood creates a hole for me to progress, or use its limb to open a hatch with the acid. Why even give me weapons if they have no effect?

But it teases you a couple of times with being close to the end, but then it just goes on. And goes on. And goes on.

The frustrating thing is, that the gameplay gets better and better, but you just want the game to end by some point. It's like a cheap action flick where the bad guy just keeps coming back even though the movie is already well beyond the two-hour-mark.

Also there are two horribly frustrating slow section that just lead nowhere. They don't provide good gameplay, no exposition, no new plot elements, nothing. Both of those sections are like 30 minutes and are just a drag.

Now on the the core of the game, the alien. Again graphical and audio design is spot on. In terms of gameplay the alien is miserable imo. When I play a stealth game I want the feel that a planned out strategy pay's off. As that's what you do in the slow paced stealth genre. You do not get that with the alien. It's all random and open to some serous cheating B.S. On top of that you can easily tell that the alien is hard wired to make it difficult no matter what you do. I was told there are two AI's the director that for example makes sure the alien is in the same room/area you're in. Then there is the ""dynamic"" alien AI when it is in the same room walking around. Both make the stealth below average. The biggest example is the early medical facility level. The director makes sure that no matter what the alien is always in your direct path should you get to the next section even if you distract it or sneak past it. As if it magically knows where you're going to be. The actual alien either is really easy or way more often cheating magically knowing where you are hiding no matter how careful. Resulting in very frustrating deaths. Being a person that enjoy's the old thief games and the styx stealth game series which to me are examples of good stealth games. This game clearly could have hit the mark if it weren't for the alien killing if for me.

I don't mind dynamic difficult enemies but this is just ridiculous. No amount of strategy, or patience will get your reliably past the alien. It is mostly luck which is really bad for a stealth game. It starts to be noticeable after the first two alien encounters.

The human and android enemies are much better though relatively easy compared to the alien. They follow a predictable easily memorized path which if you have some tools are easy with a little patience. Pretty standard and a much needed relieve after alien sections.

The crafting system gives meaning to some exploration to find materials which is nice. There is some backtracking mainly for collectibles. Its just padding.

After thinking about it I'd give it a 5/10 for most people which are not aliens fans. The story and terrible alien stealth sections really bring it down as its mostly frustration. With the other enemies being bog standard. Great graphics and atmosphere. With great attempts at world building. For die hard aliens fans this would be a 7/10."
992,1,0.3515,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","The publisher and the devs have clearly put a tonne of money and effort into building a game worthy of the Ridley Scott classic.  On a technical level, it's a hugely impressive rendering of an [i]Alien[/i]-style space station, complete with authentic Ron Cobb icons all over the place.

Sadly, they haven't managed to make a game that's actually fun to play.  It's too linear and prescriptive.  The game decides what you're going to do and where you're going to go next.  Your defensive tools for dealing with the hostile humans and androids are so limited and ineffectual, it's really just an endless, painfully-slow stealth through the interminable corridors and vents, trying to avoid detection.

The acting's great, as far as it goes, but there's not too much of it and the artists are working with a script that calls for nothing other than constant, characterless, generic earnestness, with none of the humanising aspects of the original film.

I didn't play too far into it.  I went back and saved my game at the wrong time, leaving me permanently stuck in a loop of reloading and getting caught and killed.  I'm not really enjoying it much, so I've uninstalled.  I doubt I'll come back to it.

It's in these moments where you're just waiting for it to leave so you can make about 7 seconds of progress before you have to hide again that you start to think, ""This is a huge space station with several other people on it, why in the hell is it always after me?""

This game.. it breaks my heart... i feel betrayed. I did not think that something could disappoint me more than colonial marines (absolutely hate that one), but it did.. Isolation did it... the trailers and early gameplay was so freakin' promising. I will start with what i liked, the atmosphere is nice, and the decorations are very nostalgic, also androids, but that is about it.. seriously there is nothing more to this game. Bugs (pretty severe ones regarding sound) , graphical glitches, (no no it is not the hardware, nor the software, (2019 hardware and clean operating system install, no bloatware no tons of programs, nothing.)), the AI is laughable, it feels like an insult, sophisticated ai MY ASS. the ai is dumb, and when it is not dumb, it is unfair, i tried playing crouched almost all the time, the alien did not see me, if it came down the vents i threw decoy and went the opposite way, then suddenly bam it teleports to the vent in front of me and insta kills me. iam not a stealth player, and iam quite bad at being stealthy (more guns blazing type) , but i tried my absolute best. when i hear him come down the vents, i drop the decoy in one room, move two rooms ahead, hide in the closet, and it comes right at that precise location where i am hiding. if this is games attempt at being all creepy and spooky and trying to intimidate or raise tension this way, fuck it, FUCK it. Also at one point i wanted to observe the alien, to evaluate how he moves etc. there was quite a large room for that, i went in circles observing aliens behavior - it is laughable, first of all alien stomps like a bull in a china shop (very funny), then i actually see that he knows my location without even seeing me, i move left he moves left, i move right he moves right, you can actually make him do a stupid dance, right left right left left right. i mean.. yes this is a rant, you can call me a noob or tell me to get my baby wipes, but it wont change anything... now the parts where alien was not around, only androids, now that was intense cool creepy, i loved all the parts when alien was not around (great in alien game, right?). after i gathered enough resources and tools to scare off alien, i did not do stealth any more, i just ran through the game. At first half the game discourages exploration, it punishes you for exploring, and later, when you actually have time, you do not want to do it no more. besides, i do not wanna go full oldfart ranting, but the game when alien is around is actually pretty boring... finished the dlc's like in 5 min tops each (20 euro for that is a very amazing price isn't it ?). I honestly do not understand the praise of this game, and i am genuinely angry at those who accepted this low budget and low quality product, does the nostalgia really makes up for everything ??? i also take into consideration the fact that this was not a game for me. i wanted to refund but i could not (because of dead lines and ingame spent time, really liked the first hour or two).

999,3,0.4193,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This might be my biggest hot take of all, but Alien Isolation is just not my cup of tea. I'm a pretty massive fan of horror games all considered and I've played so many I've lost count. Alien Isolation however, just does not do it for me.

Breaking it down, the main reason I dislike this game is purely because of its gameplay design. I find Alien Isolation to be frustrating, unnecessarily slow, repetitive and unfocused as a horror experience. The thing is, the last time I beat Alien Isolation was years ago, so I saw fit to revisit the game and give it another shot, this time playing it on the hard difficulty, the games 'recommended' way to play.

Once things get going though and the true gameplay loop began, I remembered exactly why I have always felt so disillusioned with this particular title. It's visuals and atmosphere are stunning. The music is awesome and incredibly faithful to the Alien film. It's probably the most faithful video game based on a film franchise I have ever seen in my life.

But when I actually start playing, I very quickly find myself grinding my teeth to absolute dust with just how much of a pain in the ass this game can be at times.

I think the true crux of the issue revolves around the Alien A.I. Maybe its just me, but in all my experience with this game, I have not once found the Alien truly intelligent or unpredictable, no, in fact it was the polar opposite. The Alien has always felt to me like he was on rails, always constantly placed in my goddamn way, regardless of whether or not I was being dead silent, or the loudest motherfucker on the entire station.

I experimented a bit, and found my options were basically just, move at the speed of a sloth and just maybe I'll get lucky enough to get past by the roll of the dice, or I go loud and instantly die. This wouldn't piss me off nearly as much if not for the fact that not even the quiet route was reliable in my experience. The alien always ignored my noise makers, instead choosing to keep his ass planted in my way no matter what. On top of this, he will constantly force me to hide in certain areas because he will always somehow sniff me out, regardless of whether or not he's actually seen or heard me. This leads to sections going on for waaaaay longer than they should, and because of the extremely unforgiving manual saving system, on top of dying an insane amount, I would constantly be forced to replay these insanely slow and tedious sections over and over and over.

Now ordinarily, I would just bite the bullet and switch up the difficulties to make the game less of a ball-ache. But because the difficulties are either 'too hard' or 'too easy', there was no solid middle ground for me and I felt like I was on the wrong difficulty regardless of what I chose. Whenever I actually escaped an encounter, it never felt like I was outsmarting the Alien, it always felt like I just got lucky, completely negating most of my satisfaction from surviving an encounter.

After experimenting with multiple play-styles, gadgets and so forth, but still dying over and over again in the same dip-shit ways with no obvious solution in sight, I've had to just accept maybe I just don't get it.

If you love Alien Isolation, I'm genuinely happy for you, I wish I could be one of those people, but after multiple tries at revisiting this game since my original play through, I just can't do it.

My thoughts? Definitely give it a try, because you may very well find enjoyment here that I didn't, this review is more to mark my personal negative experience with it"

1002,3,0.3565,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I think the game story was alright, but the game should have had way better story ending with not showing your player character Amanda in what seems as the last alien battle with your game player taking a dive into open space in ending of the Game and without defeat of the Alien.  

There should have been a final intense scary battle with the alien aboard the ship and a final resolution to the alien threat that the Character Amanda faces with the alien that she finds out the Alien threat was not over and when the player character had little time and options. The end scene did not show any steps at defeating the alien threat after leaving the station. 

I was still questioning what happened to the ship, what did Amanda do to both get back to the ship and defeat the alien and the alien threat aboard the ship. Was the ship in the end destroyed, what happened to the ships Captain Verlain and her Co Pilot aboard the ship....  

The survival challenges also could have been way better and the one scene in the real first Alien movie, where the Actor Captain Dallace looks for the alien in the air ventilation system tunnels could have been done way better in the game and the gamer should have experienced as much as a real terrifying scare and challenge in getting out of the tunnel system through passing through many vent ducts and different ladder in floors. 

In the first Alien Movie, the Actor for Captain Dallas was able to move through multiple different tunnel entry points, openings to different junctions and many upper and lower levels in floors from different tunnel system ladders. The survival challenge that represents the Game in Alien Isolation was very too short and quite sloppy and in not much comparison at all with the first Alien movie scene where the game tries to take off from when Dallas gets killed in the air ventilation system tunnels in junction 3.  Even in the game it would have been so much cooler and creepier going up and down letters to different game play areas and through many different air ducts between different levels of floors in both entry and exit points. Maybe the Alien was not on the second level  for example after going down the ladder, but when the player went down to level three or four, the player was killed without properly checking to see if the alien was making noise and or in that area. 

The survival challenges could have had better challenge scenes and longer areas to explore for the player and the Alien. The survival challenges should have aloud the player to adjust the challenge time between very less time to more time without failing in getting every task done in a reasonable time frame.  

The weapons could have been better reasonably, there could have been maybe a bit of better selection. 
I also feel that maybe the game developers could have had the android Samuel  at some point turn on the player  with not yet getting killed and or trick the player throughout the story, as the androids are more serving at protecting the alien specimen rather then helping the player get through the challenges in the game. 

Androids including Samuel are from the Company and work and are property of only for Company creepy, manipulative and hard to read evil purpose at only protecting both the Company and the Alien Specimen at all cost regardless of casualties.    

Between fair, but honest Game Scoring between a score of 1 - 10, 1 being very awful and 10 being Beyond Excellent, I would honesty rate the Alien Isolation Game as a Score of #3, from my many hours of Game Play on Alien Isolation, including great Alien movie knowledge and overall gaming experience. 

I would say the Game was a direct insult to the first Alien movie. But that was just a gaming and movie personal observation.

Now imagine it plays in a somewhat large open world map, except most of this open world is locked and the path unlocks linearly so it's actually just a disguise. 

Now imagine there's only one guard in the entire game. If this guard sees you, he sprints at you and immediately kills you, no fighting is possible. And then we add in the fact that this guard has the ability to teleport to your last known sector, always. So let's say you're in Sector A,  the guard will teleport there and start patrolling. You can actually wait until he's the furthest away possible from the exit door, then sneak your way to Sector B... and as soon as you get there, he's patrolling Sector B. If you turn around and come back, he will be there waiting for you. 

This ultimately means that the ""stealth"" is really just waiting for the guard to move away, darting into the next room, hiding under the table for the token ""oh spooky the alien is walking around the table where I'm under"" moment, then squat walk your way to the next room and repeat (""oh spooky i'm inside the locker and the alien is outside"")

Thanks to the alien's apparently ability to teleport, this is either a bad job at showing the alien navigating to my new area (and punishing me for letting it trail me to the next area) or this is a bad job at hiding the Oh Big Reveal at the end that I'm sure will inevitably happen: [spoiler]there's more than one alien oh no[/spoiler]. 

Then you add the one final ingredient that every modern game has to have, which is Fallout 4 style looting and crafting to reward you for ""exploring"" (and by that I mean checking every corpse and toolbox-under-the-staircase for 3x electronic mcguffins) and yeah you basically have Alien: Isolation.

It even includes all the cliché horror moments where you're talking with a person through a window and they are then killed from behind in front of you, oh no!

I am surprised at the reviews. The game is not scary, it's hard to be scared of an alien that is invincible to bullets. Yep you got that right. You get a gun in a game with an alien which is probably your best bet at survival, yet it's absolutely useless.

 Ellen Ripley first encounter with this vicious beast was in a transport vessel with no guns, so the movie tone is set around her outwitting the alien and avoiding it and in the end killing it by evacuating it into space, it's only her and the beast, and the tense suspense that horror movie gave its viewers is why it's a timeless classic. They tried to capture that kind of suspense in this game, but it fails.

The Alien is comical, even its programmed movements make it look robotic. The game starts off with some nice build up, but as soon as you start playing hide and seek with a cheating AI, you start laughing, and the fear factor fades almost instantly.
The alien ""knows"" where you are, and the AI will give you a hard time making sure it's around you almost constantly. So hide, move, then hide, then move.
Hide in a room inside a storage cupboard, to have it suddenly open it and scare you while tearing you out and eating you... only that the door to the room didn't open and it was outside it. Teleporting AI nice!

Got a gun with 8 rounds, headshot the the alien 8  times before it reaches you and it doesn't even flinch. Bullet proof alien skin? Nice!

I can see some schmuck sitting in an executive chair that's never played video games obviously had something to say in some of the game design. Want to open a door? Press a single button right? Nah!. This game you have to press a series of keys to open that door! WOW Innovative! 

The field of view is always trash, and you have to fuck around to try get it so its playable. The key binds are trash, the game has added quick time events to add ""challenge"".

Ever seen a Esports game where everyone is running around doing a bunch of quick time events for a cash prize pool? No? Me neither so just fuck right off.

1019,3,0.5206,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","There is sadly ""neutral"" icon for games, so while I will not recommend the game, I think it is still worth playing if you can get the game for around 20€. 

This game could be a masterpiece, but it often fails as a game. The game is now 5 years old, but it still looks fantastic. I am not just talking about the quality of textures and the lighting of the game world, but also about the design. This game brings the (now) retro-future look of the first movie on the screen and expands it by a lot. The graphical design is just really good. The sound of the game is also very good and to me, it is on the same level as the first Dead Space and sometimes even better. 


But let's get to the negative aspects of the game. This will also contain some very mild spoilers.


This game has one big problem and that is the alien itself. Note that in the first movie, the alien had a total screentime around 4 minutes. While this was also due the budget of the movie, I am also certain it was a decision that was actively made for artistic reasons too. If you show your monster too early and too often, it stops being scary. This is a rule the game breaks for around 70% of the game. I usually liked the game the most, when the alien was not on the screen. Especially the first 40% of the game are pretty much alien encounter spam.

This would be less negative, if the encounters with the alien are fun. Which they are not. This is due to how the alien behaves on a mechanical level and that is pretty terrible. On the release of the gane, a lot of media was praising the clever AI of the game. I can only see a couple of reasons for making those statements.

1. Only having played 2 hours of the game.
2. Just copying what other magazines wrote.
3. Writing what a PR Manager told you and never questioned it.

The AI is not ""smart"" and apart from relatively frequent glitches, the AI operates on 3 basic senses.

1. Always knowing where you are
2. Sense of hearing
3. Field of Vision

Especially the first point is a cause for much frustration or head scratching. Sometimes the alien wil just find you, disregarding if the player has made any mistakes or not. You can everything right and still get killed by the alien. In most cases, contact with the alien is a one hit kill. The problem is that you can not get competent in this game, because there is hardly any to get competent. At least not in regard to the alien. This is also horrible in combination with the terrible save point system. You can only save at terminals that are placed throughout the levels. A ""random"" death often means playing the same parts again and again, just to get randomly killed because the game is punishing a player that has not made a mistake. All of this creates a version of the alien that is not scary at all and is at the best of times just a little bit annoyng and often frustrating. 

There are some parts of the game, where it really does shine. That is usually when there is no direct contact with the alien and you are in flight or fight situations with more ""traditional"" enemies. Those are usually at slower pace and you can also appreciate the (positive) horror that is Sevastopol Station. 

So in the end I can not recommend this game to the general audience. But if you have a good tolerance for frustration and you want to see one of the best looking and feeling game worlds ever created, then I think you should check this game out."
1020,3,0.3648,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","tl:dr - Just boring. Really tedious and boring.

What starts off as quite a creepy and scary experience, quickly descends into a boring and repetitive farce. Poorly implemented mechanics combined with monotonous, repetitive and tiresome objectives quickly reveal this game to be a shallow and unfulfilling ordeal. 

Imagine you took a game like Outlast, a rather linear but thrilling experience, then padded it out with a lot of pointless objectives and reduced all threats to just one proper enemy. One that is a complete moron, but always knows exactly which area of the game you are in. Then ask the player to walk over the same areas, time and again, to maximise encounters with this enemy. That is Alien Isolation, that is the whole package.

My first time playing the game resulted in me putting it down after a few hours, just out of sheer monotony. I picked it up again recently, as it's a ""horror"" game and it's October, so i figured i'd give it another go. Needless to say, i'm putting it down again halfway through as it's just frightfully dull and tedious.

But it is mostly trying to hide and thereby avoid the Creature over and over again.   that got tedious --  for me at least.

1026,1,0.3922,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I've never been moved to write a review before, but this time felt I should.  As a long time fan of Alien vs Predator, I had high hopes for this game.  I'd heard great things and, having watched the introduction sequence and played the first few missions, it seemed to be everything I'd hoped for.  Then I met the alien.

The first time I got killed was genuinely terrifying.  The 20th time was simply infuriating.

To be clear, this is no Alien vs Predator.  You are armed with a dismal array of utterly useless gimmicks against the alien.  Yes, _the_ alien.  There is only one, and it cannot be killed.  You, on the other-hand, will die again and again, each time restarting from the previous checkpoint; probably not the kind of horror they were aiming for.

You're supposed to be Ripley's daughter, but having spent most of the game crawling about on my knees and hiding in cupboards, I can only imagine I'm an embarrassment to my mother.  No wonder  she left me for the Nostromo .  I am  no Ripley, and the game won't let me be.

Alien Isolation is not enjoyable.  Give me pulse rifles and smart guns.  Give me strobe lights and walls coated  with acid blood.  Give me a worthy descendant of  Alien Vs Predator."
1027,3,0.4081,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I can't get into it. The story is interesting enough to keep you engaged, but the graphics kind of take you out. It's like looking through goggles smeared in vaseline, and there's no fix. Past that, I just don't find the gameplay fun or the atmosphere particularly tense.

Longer: I should add the AI is very predictable (in a bad way) with very little room for alternative routes. Even if the monster is 100m away (outside radar range), you could know that it comes RUNNING back (literally) so it's not like you have nerve-wracking time to explore either. What's the point of going silent if the game just puts it in your face anyways? You end up having to trial-and-error how to get past it's routes, rather than worry if it's smart enough to find out or get lucky. It honestly feels like a speedrun after enough deaths. Items almost feel useless because if it's close enough for you to need that in an emergency, you're either A) already dead or B) throwing the item will just bring it closer to your room. Some distractions don't really last long enough to warrant the risk of going in the open to use them.

I could get over bad gameplay if the atmosphere was good enough, but again, it feels like you're looking through vaseline the whole time. They really should have done a better job, ideally opting for sharper shadows and lighting similar to the FEAR series."
1028,3,0.3469,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Alien Isolation has various Problems.
Graphics, Sound- and Worlddesign arent part of them.
The Game however fails by trying to combine 2 Games.

On one hand you have the parts that are obviously taken from System Shock.
An evil AI in control of the Station, trying their best to kill you with it's drones.
While you try to stop it and later on try to atleast escape.
With your Engineering Skills, Bag of Tools and a handfull of Guns and Gadgets.

Then there is the Outlast inspired Horror Game.
The Alien is a walking Deathtrigger a la any other Horror Game with an Entity stalking you, 
that will grab and kill you if it finds and gets to you.

These 2 Designs clash VERY harshly.
The System Shock inspiration leads to a semi ""open world"" design, to make sure you cant leave the Alien behind in a different Section or Area entirely, they put it on a Leash and tied it to your Character.
This means that despite there being a Spacestation for it to roam, its alwasy next to you.
(The later Plot twist doesnt explain it away, 
since then you have to ask why there is only 1 Alien near you at all times)
The lenght of the Leash also changed with difficulty settings.
Meanwhile most of your Tools and all of your early Game Weapons are useless against the Alien.
A Medikit to heal yourself is pointless in a Level if the Alien is the only or Main threat,  since the Alien will rarely ""only"" hurt you, it will likely kill you or leave you alone.
Half way throug the Game you get a Weapon that turns the Alien, which so far was the ULTIMATE INSTANTLY KILLING THREAT, into something less than a tedious nuisance.

The System shock part of this Game is pretty decent and could have made a great Game,
but the Wallofdeath Alien stalking you most of the Game breaks it.
The Game also extremly overstays its welcome with near 25 Hours of ""Story"" a.k.a.
""YAY, We got rid of the Alien""- ""Ah fuck it got away, lets try again""."

1032,3,0.5206,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing",Well really enjoyed this until it started crashing constantly. PRETTY LAME
1033,1,0.4773,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I remember the first hour or so of this game vividly, it looked and felt like classic Alien. From the old-school technology, to the aesthetics of the corridors, and the mood setting sound, perfect. I berated a couple of friends into watching a (choppy) stream of me playing, and they both agreed it looked and felt like the original movie. So it's a shame about how the game plays out.

Don't get me wrong. Technically it works well, and the first few hours are genuinely entertaining. When the androids came along I loved it, at first, then I was a little frustrated. My atmospheric exploration game had become a sneaky game of crouching under tables and hiding in lockers for REALLY long periods. The punishment for mucking it up was pretty much instant death, Alien Isolation is not a forgiving game.

The fixed save positions suck, I mean really suck, I'm not a man with infinite time to replay whole chunks of game just because I didn't know there was an alien up that vent. It's a cheap, dated game mechanic that belonged on the consoles of the 90s and needs to fuck right off.

So anyway, an alien up a vent dropped on me and I was insta-gibbed, losing all my progress to that point. There was little warning, apparently I needed to know about the alien goo dripping from the roof, though this was never communicated to me in-game. Great, lesson learned. Realistically, this is probably not the end of the world and I could have worked through it had it not been for the fixed save points. I hate repeating myself, but we're not all 15 year olds with infinite time and patience to replay the same part of the game over and again. I want to see new content, not the same room/corridor/underneath of a table for an hour.

So then the titular alien showed up properly and the cat v mouse gameplay it introduced was fun - for about thirty minutes. Thirty minutes was the time it took for me to be killed several times because I failed to get things just right. The alien moved in unpredictable patterns, used vents and pipes and could hear and see you from really far away. It was fast, omniscient at times, and hard to track when it got into the ceiling. If it sighted you, you died. If you moved to fast, you died. If you wanted to get on and keep enjoying the game, too bad - dead.

Let's break out into a little aside here and get a few things straight. I like sneaking mechanics, I often choose to play sneaky characters in RPGs and first person games and whatnot. I like sniping, and sneaking, and backstabbing, and hiding. I played through SOMA (so I don't mind being helpless) and it only caused some mild anger at various stages. It was fair (and excellent). I also like choice, I like to choose my approach. Another game that does this well (and fairly) is Dishonored. If I feel like sneaking, I can. If I mess it up, I have avenues to escape and try again without being killed (unless I'm trapped or incompetent). I'm not forced to hide in a cabinet for several minutes while the alien wanders around aimlessly only to have it suddenly find me in a very unwelcome game of hide and seek.


You get to do a lot of this. Enjoy.
This is what Alien Isolation became for me, and at one point I tried over and over to progress, reloading and reloading, swearing and banging my mouse (gently) on the desk. I looked up a walkthrough, yep, I was doing it right, you just had to time it perfectly. There was no clever solution, just be lucky and time it right. Even if you did time it perfectly, you still had to be lucky. I got past that part through sheer determination, but that was pretty much the end for me. The magic was gone.

Verdict: Technically great. Atmospherically excellent. Mechanically interesting. Gameplay, terrible. I don't play games to be angry and frustrated, that's why I have a job. And on a really specific point, seriously, it's not 1995 anymore, ditch the fixed save points. If anyone wants to call me a savescummer, fine, I'm over 40 years old and don't have any qualms saving as I progress, WHEN AND HOW I WANT TO. If I have to leave the game running because life intercedes, that's BAD. If I have to make up all of my progress again because I forget where I was at and died, you  fail at being a good game. Your game sucks if it leans on this outdated crutch to extend play time. Alien Isolation is a missed opportunity, though it probably appeals to lovers of games like Dark Souls.

Final Word: Get it for five bucks and play it for the first few hours, otherwise - NOT RECOMMENDED

1034,2,0.2871,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","The opening impressed me. It was like being in the Alien film. I was excited to play the game.

But ... a few hours in and it has yet to open up at all. It suffers from being such an obvious game world that it is hard to get immersed. These are some of the annoyances that build up.

- Very linear. There's really only one route, that you get funnelled along. It's no System Shock.
- Very scripted. Person X will notice you even if you crouch out of sight and they have their back to you if the script says so.
- You can hack power boxes but the effects are so minor and short-lived it is pointless.
- Your first challenge is to dodge four opponents who mostly signify game over if they see you (based on the fact that you've had no practice at evading). I got bored of dying and reloading,
- I killed someone with a gun. They dropped the gun. I needed a gun. I had bullets for the gun in my inventory. But I wasn't allowed to pick up the gun, because the game decided I wasn't allowed one yet. It was ridiculous.
- There's no feeling of being stalked by the Alien. Instead there's a feeling of it being a scripted event that will only appear when you hit fixed location triggers. It immediately stops being scary and believable, and just becomes annoying.
- Unskippable loading animations - I get sick of being forced to watch the same company logos/advertising.

It's a shame. I was excited about this, but the push to make it into a linear forced-path scripted story rather than allowing freedom or experimentation severely damages immersion."
1035,3,0.7435,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing",I stopped playing because I simply got bored (I didn't even make it to the Alien).  I didn't find it engaging at all.  I guess I was expecting a lot more from the game.
1036,3,0.6456,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This is not a ""Is this game bad or good"" it's a ""Would you recommend this game to a friend?"" and no I wouldn't. I think the main factor as to why I would repel any friends from playing this game is due to the god awful A.I that hones in on you and your location never straying too far from your immediate vicinity. I think Haunting Ground on the PS2 did this premise much better, where the current monster hunting you is always freely roaming a designated area and it's your job to avoid them, which is much different compared to Alien Isolation where the A.I always knows where you are and is always looming. Wouldn't it be much more terrifying if the Xenomorph was able to fully be random in its pathing so as to build the tension to a truly high degree rather than make the creature a nuisance? Imagine being in a room with it, it hops into a vent and you hear no thumping, how long do you think you have to run over and hack the door? What if it's in the area just beyond the door? Truly that would've made the game  more fun and less frustrating. As far as mechanics and visuals go, the game is fine. It captures the feel of the original Alien movie and has pretty standard gameplay of survival horror game. Not a bad game, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, just watch an LP instead.

Edit: I replayed it to refresh myself, and the game really falls apart at the end with all of the forced encounters, Jumpscares, and forced slow walking sections. I also downloaded the unpredictable alien ""mod"" which made the A.I much more bearable.  Overall it's a pretty good survival horror game, with some light metroidvania elements."
1037,3,0.401,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","TL;DR: don't play this game.  Play something fun instead.

Discover the true meaning of Rolling Your Eyes in Alien: Roll Your Eyes Simulation.

The Alien(TM) turns out to be a cardboard popup when you Make Too Much Noise.  Usually you Make Too Much Noise when attempting the truly terrifying challenge of: Navigating The Map.

And then there's the Plastic Ken Doll(tm) security robots.  And the Shoot At You For No Reason Humans(R)  

Now that is True Fear.

Ok for real: I just didn't have fun with this.  Started on Hard as recommended by the game, found the save points much too far apart and the killer barbie plastic robots really obnoxious.  

Most of all: NO MINIMAP.  System Shock 2 (which this game tries to copy) had a minimap in freakin' 1999.

What your left with, is a army of mindless robots, and human enemies that serve only to diminish your resources. While I'm confident that the alien returns just as randomly in the games conclusion, your better off just playing the dlc once you hit that 10 hour mark. So you get more of what works, and a whole lot less of what doesn't. As a final note, the exploration is a bit of a mess. Your expecting things to open up in a medroidvania fashion, but the forced backtracking takes out any of the spacial memory, usually required for that type of experience, and the rewards are not worth the effort. Hurray, I just blowtorched through 3 doors, for an uninformative audio log. In closing, I do think the game is a must play, just for the novelty of this play experience/learning curve, when things are firing on all cylinders. But I also think it's a must stop playing, when you hit that hard dip in quality, and believe me you'll know it when you get there. Buy it on sale, or not at all."

It really delivers an authentic Alien experience, and the devs should be proud of that.  You'll even develop a love-hate relationship with the motion detector, as it tells you how close to death you are.  But, the game has some serious flaws that ruin the experience.  First, there's no learning curve in the sense that I still have NO clue what cues the alien to my presence and what doesn't.  I only found out near the end of the game that that same motion detector's beeping can actually give you away...does that mean that the cans and trash strewn about everywhere make sounds that are more than just aesthetic?  Conversely, if you crouch behind even the slightest object, you somehow become invisible.  I paradoxically found it's easier to hide by circling around, making way more noise, than by hiding somewhere silently.  

But the bigger issue is the game drags on for at least twice as long as it should, and is filled with tedious ""go here and push this button"" activities that force you to stick around the area that the Alien just HAPPENS to be patrolling, and NEVER leaves.  It feels forced, and about a third of the way into the game, getting killed by the Alien turned into ""Ugh, now I have to go push all those buttons again!"" instead of ""HOLY F BALLS THAT WAS TERRIFYING!""  And that's just not what this game should be about."
1047,3,0.503,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I feel nothing after completing the game. Maybe a little bit of frustration and confusion.

The story is lame. Almost every protagonist's decision made me question her sanity because it's definitely a great idea to go into the xenomorphs' hive ALONE to blow it up or something. It's also implied that many people at the Sevastopol don't even know who/what is killing everyone. So you would not expect to see the xenomorph that often because those who did see it never got a chance to tell about their experience. But no! There it is, casually walking around while you hiding under a random piece of furniture. This is not scary, this is lame.

The gameplay is confusing. Why is there a crafting system? Why are xenomorphs so stupid that they can't spot the protagonist when she hides under the furniture right before their eyes?

This game would have been much more enjoyable if it either had an Amnesia/Penumbra style of gameplay with a silent protagonist or was some kind of a horror/RPG with an open-world.

Visually game looks amazing, design of the in-game environments is absolutely perfect. It feels like Alien movie come to life.

Gameplay is a let down, specifically interactions with Aliens and AI of Aliens breaks the immersion. 
At the time of the release of the game it was marketed as revolutionary AI that will follow player pattern and learn to hunt you. 
But unfortunately Aliens are dumb as hell and just lock on the area that you enter and walk around in circles around you.
So the gameplay ends up being that you just walk a little bit and the go to hide somewhere, and wait for Alien to go further in it's predetermined circle-path to continue. It's most of the experience with them, at list till you get the flamethrower.

Also not to mention that there is a lot of walking back and forth to find and bring something from the area that you've been to another area that you've been to.

Also when I played there was a bug that developers haven't fixed, maybe it's fixed now or it's still present in the game.
The bug was connected to all the cutscenes in the game, so when the cutscene ends and you go back to gameplay everything will be in slomotion mode for a long period of time. 

So unfortunately terrible AI and this bug killed the game for me and I was unable to finish it."

Mediocre at best. To sum up the gameplay; go from point A to point B, press E. Rinse, repeat. The Xenomorph was cool at first, then became an annoying hindrance as you tried to progress through the game. Overall, I felt like gameplay was a chore instead of being fun. Thank god for the flamethrower.

The story is a mess and below average. The end game was a disappointment and anticlimactic to say the least. Only 18 out of 100 people beat the game who play it, and I'm not surprised. The only reason I finished it was because I promised myself I would finish what I started, and wouldn't let myself quit, even though I could've moved onto another game and enjoyed my time.

It's basically just being hunted by the Alien throughout the game and hiding in lockers.

So what is really really bad about this game:
- You don't have any big options... to choose where you want to go (no open world), but instead you have to either do the main quest or some side quests! (Eg: meaning u cannot go straight to the end of the game...just to the shuttle and leave this space station...who in his right mind woulda want to explore that floating graveyard...especially at start when u meet that group of ppl which run in fear/flee)

- It's so annoying that most ppl are hostile and those ai,cyborg, robots, w/e you wanna call them 2...i mean if it is already like this...why don't you allow us jsut to kill every single moving thing there, and skip all those timewasting cutscences/talk/etc. Srsl you cannot 1 shot a robo??? and lmfao i shot a human in the head he kept walking...umm ok..

- It's really really %&/()  that you cannot shoot, teaser, electrolude, bomb, etc. the alien, ...instead the only option you have is where you have to run or/& hide from it -_-...so lame

- You only get scared of jumpscreams/noises....eg: the alien just perplexly/suddendly arrives from nowhere and makes loud noises (so turn off or lower the audio, btw sometimes the audio is borken & you hear way to late the sounds)....and how the heck is the alien faster than me ...always...there are also alot of buggs where the alien just suddendly decides to run away form you (even though its like 1 meter away and still chasing u lololol)"

Atmospherically, it works. Whenever  things aren't too dark to force you to use a flare or the flashlight for no real reason, that is.
Sadly, that's very quickly ruined by the subpar AI, total lack of respect for the player or their time & absolutely no help \ markers whatsoever in intuitive ways.

I spent 10-15 minutes running around early on because I was supposed to go down a hatch I didn't see & was not indicated to me I should be looking out for. First strike.

Second strike came when the game literally has a situation where it goes ""We need to go through that door, but they're watching. Distract them"" meaning *you* go through another door (which I thought was THE door) and turn off a thing so you can sneak past. You go back to the NPC asking you and...nothing happens. He's only scripted to go if *you* go through the correct door. Misleading instructions & obtuse design confirmed!

The last straw for me came shortly after that where you are told to check something out. A surviving woman shoots you and runs off and you're supposed to pick the item up that was near her. At that point, she comes back with help. Here are some of the problems with this :

-The map says *nothing* about where your objective is how to get to it. ""Find it, bitch"" is all you get.
-There are 3, maybe 4 NPCS with NON-FIXED patrol routes. They move around randomly, turn, don't turn - and have idiotically large vision ranges. (All of this is on Normal) I hid in a corner for 2 minutes only to be seen by a  guy who just absolutely had to go that one way.
-Which is bad because you now have to reload your game from the last save, pick up stuff you picked up *after* you saved but *before you died*again and again and again and hey good luck attempting that crappy badly designed stealth section again.
-Motion tracker exists in the game, was not given to the player to track enemy movements.
-You have no healing items and no way to MAKE healing items, so you can't just run away and waste minutes hiding to try again, either.

I gave up. 3, maybe 4 attempts, I was horribly insulted by the game's utter lack of respect for my time. I didn't feel like it deserved my attention when in this infuriating, badly designed situation, it didn't even have the absolute basic decency of pointing me at the objective item I'm supposed to arbitrarily retrieve.

It's a shame because when you take the garbage AI out of it, there is a lot of detail in the station and some of the sounds did make me look around carefully.  But when the literally unpredictable AI is shoved in your face when you have no real way of dealing with them when you aren't even used to the game...nah.
That, my friends, is just bad design.
Can't recommend this game. I expected to like it based off the praise I saw for it but...no, don't be fooled. Only the hardcore Aliens fan and those with impossibly high tolerance for bad, trial&error gameplay will enjoy this."

Alien concept is dumb, with no ways to defend yourself you just end up running and hiding all the time.
Also the idea is a bit immersion breaking, because why is the Alien always after me? Even if there are many on them on the space station, don't they have other humans to hunt which are much easier targets?

I would be slowly, methodically, and carefully moving through an area and the alien would pop out of the ceiling and insta-kill me. This happened a LOT. So much that it removed all tension from the experience. Halfway through I lost all sense of dread because I knew that I would randomly die. There didn't seem to be a way to prevent it, so there was no reason to be fearful of it. I was only able to complete the game through luck.

Had so much expectation from this game when i was starting i'm completely disappointed. The game was so irritating most of the times. The story seemed okay but unnecessarily long. The gameplay was mostly stealth if you want to complete it.
There were a few sequences which was mind-blowing but looking at the overall length it doesn't make much of an impact.

1065,1,0.3807,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","This is definitely a stealth style game. Though you are given weapons capable of killing other survivors and androids on the station, they have absolutlely no affect on the xenomorph other than possibly driving it away from you for a small amount of time. The directions the game gives you at the beginning are very short, and there's some parts where it can be a bit confusing until you try out a few things. For example, I wasn't sure how to ready the maintenance jack as it wasn't in my inventory. I wasted some items because of this, when all I needed to do was click the left mouse button. You would think that would use the current item selected? Secondly, I never saw a listing of the components I had selected. I always had to select an item to create to see what I had. Not that big of an issue either, but it does take some time.

The biggest issues for the game (at least for me) is, two things. The save system is based on the old console method. You have to find save spots on the level in order to save your progress. This can be a bit irritating when you just finished an area that is a pain to go thru, then start a new area where you're immediately needing to run or hide. If you die, then replay.

Then there's the xenomorph itself. Once it appears, it's ALWAYS THERE. It never leaves you, no matter where you go. Some quiet times where you can do some exploring and see the station would be awesome, as the graphics/atmosphere was done extremely well. There's other prey on the station that the alien can go after. Why not go there and eat them? That being said, there are a couple of mods you could download for the game to affect how the alien tracks you, but it doesn't really give you that freedom of exploring.

Be prepared for a lot of reloading the game if you play it on the higher difficulty levels. For the most part, you have to go thru an area to get an idea of the layout to effectively stay away from the big bad guy. If you get irritated/annoyed at that style of game, this is definitely not the game for you."

They've lost all of the scare factor.

The horror is good during the absence of the Xenomorphs. The bony fucker is more an ever-present inconvenience rather than something spooky. The reveal had some impact, but after that, I just got annoyed when the thing came around. 

The game drags on for too much, a lot of the tension evaporates because you spend minutes sitting in closets, sniffing your farts, until the game permits you to move on. 

Only 2 items in the game are worth anything, the rest are useless garbage. 

The level design and gameplay clashes in the ending and it was the thing that killed it for me. If I can go through the entire alien nest without dying once, but I die around 25 times in one damn corridor- there is a problem. You see, some pillock decided to plop 2 hyper-aggressive xenomorphs in a map that was designed for Humanoid enemies. This being in the ass end of the entire game, when the station is supposedly falling into a gas giant and you are supposed to get out of dodge. As I said, deflates any tension, I just ended up annoyed and the game had nothing to offer that would make me spend another hour or to figure the ""correct"" path."
1070,3,0.4066,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Alien Isolation is a prime example of ""good graphics do not make a good game"".

First, I would like to put up my cred. Ever since the first two movies, I have been a major fan of the Alien franchise/universe, been trying to get my hands on all good or at least average media with the Xenomorph in it.

I will start with the good, cause there is a lot of good in this game.

Game looks fantastic, especially considering the year it was released in. Sevastopol station looks and feels like it belongs in the Alien universe. Designers and artists have obviously done their research and seem to be major fans of the material.

Sound, be it occasional music or just the ambient sounds of the station or even the breathing and heartbeat of your character are all phenomenal.

Seriously, the audiovisual aspects of this game are some of the best I have seen/heard for a long, very long time.

And sadly, now we have to venture into the bad, which is basically everything gameplay oriented.

The game is in the Stealth genre. Which means you can expect a lot of sneaking about, not having many ways to defend yourself and your character is most likely gonna be very easy to kill. All of these are true. Yet, I think this game has failed as a good Stealth game. Why? Let me explain.

First, you get guns. A lot of them. You get pistols, shotguns, explosive weaponry, EMP weaponry, basically smoke grenades,  flamethrower, FREAKING NAILGUN... and yet none of this can kill the Xenomorph.

I understand that the Xenomorph has to be highly resistant otherwise you would be able to kill him/her fairly easily but why have they decided to give you guns? You see, none of the above can kill the Xenomorph. The flamethrower, which was seen in the CANON movies, comics, books and games to set the Xenomorph on fire which then proceeds to explode due to the reaction with the acid inside it, just makes him/her retreat for about five seconds. Sometimes, it does not even do that.

Guns that would kill the Xenomorph outright in CANON media, specifically explosives, the revolver and especially the shotgun (see Aliens vs Predator 2 and Aliens, ie, the second movie for proof) do not really do anything to the Xenomorph.

For a longtime fan of the franchise and universe of Alien, this is a much bigger betrayal than anything in Alien 3 or any of the other sequels.

And since we are on the topic of the Xenomorph, lets talk about his/her AI.

Long story short, it is cheating. The developers have boasted how good the AI is at learning and adapting to the player but in reality, from what I understand and have managed to read up online, it works like this:

- Game has two AI directors.
- One knows where you are 100% of the time.
- The other does not.
- The first one gives hints to the second one where you are without outright telling it.
- The second then uses the information given to hunt down the player.

In theory, this should work wonderfully. In practice, it means the Xenomorph always knows the general area where you are. This turns what could be an amazing Stealth game into a hundred or so hour snore fest as you always gain some ground, probably get killed cause the Xenomorph magically knew he/she has to move cause you moved, even though your made no sound whatsoever, then you repeat the process until you finish a level.

In a good Stealth game like Thief Gold or Dishonored, AI is set in stone and by observing it you can work up a strategem to exploit the weaknesses of the AI, usually specifically created by the developers to make levels fun.

In Alien: Isolation, gameplay is anything but fun.

It also does not help that the levels are all just corridors that start to all look the same very quickly. Again, it makes sense cause this is a station and it probably would be made in this way, but it does not make for good gameplay. I find it funny that games like System Shock 2 and Dead Space have managed to make something like a ruined spaceship or a space station interesting.

Anyway, this game gets a lot of praise and I find that really sad. Again, the animators, sound designers etc. did an amazing job, but sadly, their effort was put into a game that is barely a 4/10."

If the concept of an alien walking around near you doesn't get your knickers in a tizzy, then this game has nothing for you. If you're not easily scared, there's nothing else here to keep your attention. It just sorta feels like progressing in Metal Gear Solid 3: You very slowly crawl forward on your face at a glacial rate with frequent stops so as not to be spotted. But instead of an interesting, fleshed out game world, with multiple, diverse ways of interacting with the environment and AI, a variety of weapons and items, and an engaging story, you instead get instantly killed, sometimes even when you're properly hidden (a touted feature for some reason), and you're sent back to the last save point, only to inch your way forward again, more careful this time, so that you hopefully don't have more of your time wasted by the simple stealth gameplay that makes Skyrim's look like it has depth.

The long and the short of it:

If you pick this up, get ready for immersive gameplay that will regularly be interrupted by you walking around aimlessly, wondering WTF you are supposed to do next, only to eventually give up and google it to discover that you stumbled on another ""door stays locked"" or something bug which is followed by hours of googling for a workaround. I definitely had good fun with this game but at the same time dealing with its bugs was a torture. In addition to bugs, there are also occasionally mission objectives that are very unclear on what you are actually supposed to do next. Eventually I gave up and just started following a walk through.

The game is very linear, to the point that you're regularly following a single corridor with no alternatives. You will load and reload until you find the way the developers intended, because there's no other way. At some point you'll find the motion sensor, and from then on the game turns into ""follow the arrow"".

The tutorials are surprisingly bad: you learn about rewiring when there are humans looking for you, and they make you wait a few seconds only to be presented with a big text screen and different controls. The same goes for the computer screens where you can read some extra info: you have to do it at your own risk.

The game in general is designed to make you waste time; to increase the chances of getting caught, I guess, but it feels very artificial and pointless. The puzzles for example are mostly trivial, ranging from ""input these symbols"" to ""highlight these numbers"". Pointless.

For such a directed game it's strange to find crafting in it. Instead of adding items in the levels they only placed components and you have to craft whatever items you prefer. These components are random and you can find yourself swimming in charge packs but missing other basic items to make medkits.

The controls are clearly designed for a console, with the usual radial menu. There is a mouse cursor but it's BLACK. On a DARK game. It's usually invisible until you move it around to find it. The sensitivity can only be adjusted in steps. In my case I'm forced to leave it where it's too low, but the next step is way too high.

Overall, if you want stealth, find another game."

So why am I giving this a thumbs down? well because the games main selling point the ""alien"" is weak. I don't mean like it's too easy, quite the opposite. The alien is incredibly predictable, it will always center around you. For instance, say you have a huge level you need to maneuver, so the alien should be going around checking out noises, attacking survivors, or just generally being random. What you get instead is that the alien will constantly be patrolling the area you are in, on the off chance that it does leave your area, it will come straight back in short time, maybe you think that if the alien goes down one path then the opposite path is fairly safe? No, it will use the vents to put it itself right in your path. 
The reason I found this unenjoyable is that I was never lulled into a false sense of security, I knew that after about 15 seconds of peace the alien would come stomping back and I was always ready with a hiding spot, the game never gave me a chance to become complacent or actually feel at ease before thrusting the alien in my face time and time again.

Androids are tough, and you'll need a lot of bullets to kill them with a pistol. Attacking them with a wrench won't work in many cases. They will just grab your hand and punch you.

I changed that to Easy and have played the game through twice.  It is way more enjoyable and actually playable on the easier settings.  I would change my non-recommendation to an endorsement based off of the change in difficulty.  San Cristobol is still somewhat annoying and tedious, but it is tolerable and after that the game opens up and allows exploration of the rest of the Sevastopol, which is cool to explore.   Overall on the easiest two settings I'd rate the game a 75 and would recommend it.

Original review: The story just doesn't jive.  There is one alien on a massive ship and all the people are busy trying to kill each other.  The game explains this behavior because the people are ""scared"".  Nonsense.  People could easily come together and kill the stupid thing.  But then we wouldn't have this game, now would we?  So let's play along with the game.  Overall the representation of the space station is excellent.  High production all around.  But the gameplay and story is just downright terrible.  For example,  I got to the San Cristobol level and the game took a serious nosedive.  The alien stays on top of you and makes your movement through this level very difficult and frustrating.  You are allowed to move very briefly before the all powerful alien, which isn't even that big, comes thundering into your immediate area.  If you are not in cover, it pounces on you and kills you.  It is an absolute crawl fest, going every 10 feet then you have to hide as the alien goes back and forth looking for you.  Imagine that.  A huge space station, and the alien is only looking for you.  Well after hiding under tables and in lockers for hours on end, I admit defeat.  This isn't fun.  Plain and simple.  An atrocity of a level.  I couldn't imagine if the rest of the game is this tedious and frustrating.  It makes you just want to kill the stupid thing with your revolver.  But nope.  It does nothing to the alien.

What makes it great is you're on a mission to escape and the entire time you never know whats around the next corner. And the Alien could show up at any time as well. You have a motion detector to keep an eye on your surroundings. If you see anything moving too fast, you can bet its the Alien. Its the mystery and suspense that makes it great. You might go 5 minutes without seeing any signs of the Alien and you may go 30 minutes. If you arent keeping an eye on your motion detector and hiding, he will get you and it will scare the crap out of you if you aren't suspecting it. When the game was in this stage, I was loving it. Couldnt wait to get back into it after shutting down for the night.

Then you come to your 5th mission... getting medical supplies and Morley's Key Card. This is where I lost interest. At this point in the game, the Alien shows up(its part of the mission not just a random encounter like those before), he drops down from the vents and quietly wonders around the area that you need to complete objectives in. You must sneak around when he gets far enough away, and hide when he gets near. I tried this many times and even went so far as to take the difficulty down to Easy(was just on medium). Seemingly, he will not leave you alone for 2 seconds, step outside of your hiding spot, *beep beep beep*.. here he comes again. Hide. Rinse. Repeat. His movements are completely unpredictable. There isnt always a spot to hide near by, and if he spots you, he runs extremely fast you cant outrun him, so you can consider yourself dead if you're spotted by him. After a little while of this it is no longer scary or thrilling. It is simply annoying and frustrating. The game was fun with the mystery of not knowing when and where you're going to run into the Alien. Its not fun being stuck in a hiding spot because this is no random encounter, but programmed, he's not leaving. Also the Alien's behaviour makes no sense here. If I'm hiding and he has checked where I'm at and every where else 20 times over, it only makes sense he would get bored and go looking elsewhere. But no, he just silently walks around. 

I've watched playthrough videos to see how to do it, and as far as I can tell its a gamble. All based on luck. In some playthroughs people barely run into him at all. In others, people are stuck hiding like I have been. Not sure what gives.

I imagine the game would go back to what I was enjoying after this. But I got so frustrated with this mission that I lost all interest in the game because of it. It was a poor design choice at best.

I'd say, I hope the devs see this and learn from this mistake, but I hear the sequel is a mobile game.. so yea, something tells me they arent the brightest bunch anyways with all of the ""successful"" mobile announcements of late from other developers lol.

Anyways, since Steam still doesnt have that ""meh"" option we all would like to have in these cases, Im going to give it a thumbs down, simply because I have lost interest due to this part of the game and may or may not return and try it again. And really it just depends on what kind of person you are and what you'd enjoy as to whether I'd recommend it for you or not.

I have been a long time fan of Alien and its movies. Its games? Not so much. And this one, while the best of the bunch, is still lack luster. I was told that this game was a terrifying, survival experience that would leave the hair on the back of my neck standing on end from start to finish. As a huge horror fan I was excited to give it a try. Well, I tried it and nothing about it held my attention. The story was delivered in a horrible way. You play as Ripley's daughter who has made sure she was assigned to the sector her mother went missing. This is brought to light by the first movie if you havnt watched it. The story had potential but it fell apart before it got started. The horror aspect was laughable at best. Being stalked by an all powerful killing machine would scare just about anyone but knowing that if you are seen or even sniffed out by this monster means death then the second you are seen you might as well just sit there. There is no running. There is no fighting. Just die and try again. Personally some of the best horror experiences I have ever had that involved a monster or entity was knowing that if I am caught I have a chance to make it out alive in some way. But this monster completely removes that. The robots did a better job of making me fearful than the main focus of the story did.The survival aspect was the only thing I feel they nailed. Big monster? Stay away from it. Killer robots? Stay away from them. People that dont play well with others? Stay away from them. And above all; DONT. GET. CAUGHT! If you do then I hope you saved recently. 
I didn't hate the game. I just dont feel that it was a real horror game. That was the mentality I went into the game with. TWICE. (yes I game it 2 tries 1 on xbox a year prior to my 2nd try on PC) If you want survival or a semi intriguing story in the Alien universe then here it is. But if you want horror then look elsewhere."

The Alien isn't even in the entire game and you spend about half of it running from androids which is lame. Game starts off strong but peters out very fast.

Just running and hiding from room to room isnt really fun or entertaining."

1098,1,0.5123,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I wrote a positive review before finishing the game. Leason learned.

This was one of the most tedious videogame experiences of my life. The first 10 hours or so were amazing, and then they deciced to drag the sh*t out of it.

The game, suddenly and out of nowhere, goes from survival horror to some weird action stealth cr*p. You go from hiding from a killer alien to playing ""shoot the android in the head"". [i]Oh my God, I survived an extremely strong, fast alien with heightened senses trying to eat my face! I'm sure I'll be terrified of these slow walking, ugly plastic androids![/i]

And it feels like the game rejoices at making fun of the player. There are half a dozen of fake endings. You do the same sh*t you've been doing from the beginning of the game: you are sent somewhere to do/retrieve something, something goes horribly wrong halfway there, and then you go through plans B to Z^32. In the end, it looks like you are finally done with this... GOTCHA! An alien attacks you in the last possible second, or the floor collapses, or you get explosive diarrhea, f*ck if I know. 

So no, you are not done, you have to look for another path, or go get a Hackinator 3000™, or, my favourite one, go back to the place you were literally standing at 15 minutes ago. Oh, and you NEVER go from A to B, which would be bad enough because you have to do that 970 times. You actually go from A to B, then to A because someone sat on the remote and turned the TV off, then to B again, then to A again because you forgot the popcorn, then to B again.

The main problem here is that there is no reward. You go through hell and at the end, you accomplished [b]nothing[/b], you get a slap on the face and another sh*ttier mission.

And the alien... oh, the alien. It is sooo impressive at first. It comes out of nowhere, there's no way to fight it, if it catches you, it'll kill you. Then you get the flamethrower, and the alien goes from being this presence that you fear to an annoyance that jumps you at corridors, you roast it a bit, and it goes away.

You want to like this game? Play the first half. You'll know EXACTLY when to stop, and from then, it becomes a joke.

The first 10 hours are 8/10. The game as a whole, 3/10.

Look, there's an alien beind you. Light a match, quickly!"

It's either frustrating or boring, with nothing inbetween. I spent my entire time wondering ""when is this game going to get fun?"" and as it never did I'm not going to bother finishing it. I have plenty of other games that I would actually enjoy my time with instead of dying to the same group of eneimes yet again or getting lost because of obscure vague ogjective markers. And, of course, it has CRAFTING, because that always makes a game better. Few horror games have ever intrigued me, and I'm sad to say this one gets chucked onto the pile of walking sim, occasional scary bit games that are mostly boring with not even much to do in them other than hold W most of the time. Dead Sapce 1 and 2 are probably the only games that genuinely scared me, this one either putting me to sleep or making me mad. Oh well.

1104,4,0.2587,"pc, hide_seek, scene, list, none, guy, friend, switch, trigger, lack","In short, this game is frustrating.

The atmosphere is the best in a computer game I have played, particularly the lighting system. The ship design is great and the interaction with the ship is great and very immersive. The problem is a lack of common sense game-play, poorly implemented 'AI', cheesy jump scares, and an otherwise boring and desolate environment for a 'space station'.

The sound design follows the excellence of the set design. However the character models and animations are very poor and in stark contrast.

Every time you boot the thing up, the music and atmosphere grab you. The movement is nice and navigation is fun enough with the map and motion sensor. Then something will slap you back into reality of sitting in your chair with some sort of glitch, irritating game-play mechanic, or poorly designed system.

Other reviews complain about the game being a vent simulator. In my opinion this isn't as bad as people say, the rest of the game is actually worse including all the points I will note in this review. Hiding in corners or vents isn't bad and mostly optional when you learn the detection mechanics better. You can literally walk passed or around things or just distract them with gadgets.

The story is written in two minds, A) copy and paste from the first Alien movie. Or B) reach into a bag of Hollywood cliche and the writer picks out the most inane plot MacGuffins. For example pretty early on the game has you hunt for a medkit for an injured crew member, despite the game mechanics itself allows you to make instant healing when you want since the first 30 minutes of starting it. Your injection can heal gunshot, clubbing, strangulation, fire burns, whatever man. But for the story you need a particular kit from a certain place that takes about 4 hours to obtain in probably the hardest game segment of the offering. Another story element has you lock down a stairwell and rooms to trap an alien, despite the alien being shown to prefer travel through the roof vents and can appear in any room it wants to whenever it wants. The lock-down would in effect be totally useless and doesn't fit the game-play mechanics that you are offered.

And my disappointment in a nutshell... is that this game is just a missed opportunity to be something truly excellent. The space station is empty, and doesn't feel like a space hub. Only a quiet one liner near the late mid part made a comment that the station was due for decommissioning, I didn't get that from the start of the game. They just tried to hand wave the fact that it is so empty with about 6 charactes and about 20 randoms, and even more generic androids.

The story itself doesn't do any justice to Ripley or the Nostromo. The few sentences they have from Sigourney Weaver are pretty empty too. The plot is bare-bones but usually this is OK if there is significant character development or likeable ones at that matter. In Alien Isolation you get neither. The daughter character that you play is limp, weak sounding, always scared of everything and annoyingly to me says 'FUCK' too much. No development occurs. All other characters die, have no progression and do very little in the game other than give you some mission direction. This is very lacking for me and very lazy.

People on the internet who like this game seem to have installed some of the very few mods there are, and I simply HAD to install the unpredictable alien mod to loosen the 'tethering' that the alien has to you. Without this, and the fact that I started on Normal difficulty, I would have just stopped playing about 1/3 of the way through.

Having gone through the game, I would not play without the mods I have installed. Also I feel the mechanics are clearer in my mind and I could play in a harder difficulty... but the lack of interesting stealth mechanics, story, characters or character development... I'll pass.


A list of my gripes that I have compiled:

1. Gun accuracy is borderline broken, the precision bloom shrinks when you aim and stand still but at maximum the shot can miss even at near point blank aiming at the head of a stationary humanoid.

2. Gun usefulness... the weapons are plain garbage with exception of the flame thrower. Not enough damage is dealt, especially to synthetic humans; and the weapons do nothing to aliens.

3. The navigation system is to collect pieces of paper from terminals? I didn't understand it. Near end game I figured out what was going on and that some objectives are directed by the motion sensor. I wish the game taught me how to move A to B better.

4. Save confirm issue; you want to save? Click a terminal and stand there for 5 seconds, then an ugly pop up box appears and asks you to confirm you want to save. YES for flip's sake I want to save, that's why I used the save terminal FFS.

5. Some controls are poorly implemented, particularly the select wheel for items and crafting of these items.

6. Computer control of the 'civilians' is pretty broken. Sometimes they will stand there gawking at you, or just running around in circles. There is no interaction with them at all unless you kill one then lose the game instantly.

7. The aliens are either 100% going to get you, or totally stupid. This is particularly bad in the beginning of the game. There seems to be two modes the 'AI' is working in, and these operate differently at certain areas of the game.

8. The missions are linear paths with one way to progress. This can turn into a pixel hunt when you are lost (which happens a lot). This is not a metroid-vania game. Returning to areas is only to move to a new mission and re-use the assets to populate with different enemies when necessary.

9. Aliens are 'tethered' to you within a 10-20 metre radius when activated. You can not leave it behind, even if it can't find you it will follow you to another area in the mission. They don't wander the space station and interact with anything else at any point in the game. The exception is if there are people in your current area, then it will kill everything.

10. The alien at the start is attracted to noise but only in certain zones where the game wants it to happen. The missions alternate between 'people zone', puzzle area, alien zone, and story zone. The alien is arbitrarily disabled during the story segments, noise or otherwise will not summon it. The immersive and suspension of disbelief is destroyed with this careless plot implementation.

11. This is also the case with other areas with set pieces or some actors. Noise created by people running or shooting will not summon an alien. Only when you run or hit something or shoot will the alien appear in the correct type of zone. This compounds the loss of common sense and game-play becomes dissonant with the world building and plot.

12. Some animations are missing, people AI is broken as sometimes they stand in a static pose even if conversations are occurring. Replacing flash-light batteries have no animation; and the flame thrower reload is missing sound.

13. Start of game soft lock, literally 5 minutes into the game locked in a room with no way to start the first mission. Other soft locks can occur during a mission and ruin a save file.

14. Pointless space walk segments at snails pace movement speed with no game-play and very little story delivery or character development. Usually in a better game these sections would encourage interaction between characters or deliver plot; in this game some dialogue occurs but it is quite insignificant. This occurs three or fours times and is a chore at each event.

15. Jump scares and repetitive mini-games, quick time events or as I call it slow time events. You like pressing infinite button combinations for every type of interactive object? Great for you... not for me.

16. The ending climax uses quick time events and seems to have a missing animation or video? From pressing an emergency button to appearing in space in a suit... what? Where's the middle bit?"

It could've been a classic but sadly it's just another game that was sacrificed for longevity and don't even get me started on sadistic AI that someone thought was scary, fun or fair, let's just stay on the example from the first sentence :)"

1107,3,0.3825,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing"," First of all, I got this on sale for 11 Euros, my review's negative because it surely isn't worth the base price of 37 Euros, but it's worth a try if it's on sale.
 I really want to like this game, it's awesome at certain rare moments, which are, as I said, rare, too rare to keep the rest of the game from being a mess. It's got a ton of bugs, you'll see animations not working properly, tons of crashes, or even for example, the E prompt to save yourself from Synths appearing for a split second on Nightmare difficulty, even though it's impossible to press E about 10 times in a split second, so that's just lazy polish, or no polish at all actually.
 If you play this, you'll realize the game shines at the start and even middle if I'm kind, the further you go, the more boring it is, you get spammed with new, useless weapons which don't even do anything to your current ennemies, and, this is partly because of hardcore mode, but since you barely get any components and weapons don't do shit and you get one shotted by EVERYTHING, some parts are purely luck based, so you'll find yourself skimming through the game super easily, getting stuck on a part for hours on end, and then go back to skimming through the game. Rinse and repeat for about 16 hours total.
 I think disappointed is the best word I can find to describe this game, I was really looking forward to trying it, only hearing good from it, but it's actually a buggy mess which only managed to scare me once, by making an elevator fall off in the middle of a part where nothing happened for a good 20 minutes, I was so bored I forgot I was playing a ""horror"" game and this dumb crap got me, feel free to argue in the comments about how good it is and how I can't understand how genius it is."

Overall I feel disappointed. Perhaps I expected too much as I am huge fan of Alien series and all that is related to it. But this game is like a walking (crawling?) simulator mixed up with room escape.
I do not categorize this game as a horror game, so the fear is not mandatory for me. But when I saw the alien for the first time in this game my thougth was like: ""Oh, here it is, eventually"". Androids were more oppressive than the alien and it should not be so.
Perhaps I will finish it just to see how it ends. But my stomach revolves when I think to walk again from point A to point B to open some door to next section that is built upon exactly the same scheme."

1. just go to the certain place which is always on the other side of the map (im fine with this) 
2. you get to the location you need to get electricity going/ activate something (im fine with this). 
3. you need to go back the whole map. 
Often times i found myself just going the same routes 3 or more times because of this requirements (THIS IS EXTREMLY TEDIOUS especially with with a bloody Alien hunting your ass). 
Levels get memorable not because of their good design but because you had to roam every corridor like a lunatic. I played on the second hardest difficulty and i didnt mind playing with limited resources (liked the challenge) but this repetition that i mentioned killed the game for me. It reminded me of the first Assassins creed game where half of all missisons was this exact repetition and in Alien: Isolation this was even worse.

although game is pretty good i don't regret buying it
i completed this game two times
first it was some 5 years ago i kinda liked it for the scary atmosphere and graphics
after i finished it not long after i decided to buy it in steme so i grabbed the key for 5 bucks and didn't touch it
till recently i decided to replay and obviously i'm not so naive like last time so i would call it one time horror now
cause after today i see things clearly enough it's one not ending stress
endless crouching looting shit crafting shit finding keycards unlocking doors
powering up generators oh and of course levers! oh god!
very slow temp of the game yeah many said that already but still
it even maybe make you lose interest cause all of that mini quests where you need go there pull that lever here and restore power there and etc i'm so fuckin stressed after that shit! pls no more i'll better go play call of duty 
i even encountered a bug with a keycard dropping from android
androids just vanished and i left for 30 minutes running looking all recent locations for this keycard until i was forced to google it and i find out it drops from the fuckin android really
that i killed 30 minutes ago! aaa? loaded previous save it solved
but still imagine how this is frustrating
stupid scripted alien only afraids of fire
others thing just don't work on him not even scare him
and to get a flamethrower you need to do a lot of crouching till you get this son!
my personal hateful location it's medical i thought about dropping the game there
and i played at easiest difficulty! nice
of course it was easy kinda but still it hard anyway

1118,3,0.5646,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Honestly, this game does so much right. Atmosphere, Visuals, Sound, even the core gameplay of gathering and crafting. But the one thing it does wrong that absolutely KILLS horror games, is it has no sense of pacing. At all.

The first few hours are spent really getting you immersed into the game, understanding the world, setting up the horror moments. It's great! Then the Alien comes. You spend about half and hour or so avoiding it and trying to do some objectives, and you go ""oh shit that was pretty intense.""

Then comes another hour with the alien right after. You sit there and twiddle your thumbs as you wait for it to walk past you, go ""Man I wish this guy would go away"" rather than having any sense of fear.

Then, finally, you find yourself dealing with a group of huma- nope. Alien's still there. Another hour or so babysitting him. It was at this point I was just frustrated with how slow I was moving, how often the Alien would sit there doing nothing. All sense of horror was completely stripped from the game because of this huge pacing issue.

You need to tease the fear. Having it come in waves, mix it up. This game just dumps it in your lap and it very quickly becomes a game of slow mechanics as opposed to any sense of horror."
1119,2,0.3622,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","So this is a great game, but there are a couple reason I would have to eventually thumbs down the game.
Graphics are beautiful but some where sort of lazy. While I enjoyed looking over everything I noticed in particular while the alien had a beautiful strut and they obviously wanted to show off its tail, it was not as scary as I had expected. While nice looking, they didn't take into account that any animal with a tail utilizes its tail for balance. The scene where you hide and the tail slithers off the desk, was a great start to its movements and then it was just- ""Okay scene! Now let it drag on the floor, any animal we have seen and even any alien movie we have seen shows them, clearly, dragging their tail. DO IT"" Aliens in the movies didn't have floppy tails for this reason, for they were poised almost scorpion like while running on all fours, and I imagine that they wouldn't just let it drag on the floor while on back legs either. They were meant as the Aliens most lethal weapon and by far scariest, from its sharp tip to its creepy poise. This game sort of let it fall, so to speak.
The Sounds! Oh boy, the sounds are broken. I'd have to ask people who play the game and see this review just listen, especially by the windows *especially when its obvious there is nothing further out about your window because they are angled upward* If the Aline Ai is matching up with those noises, it'd have to actually be outside the window heading into space sometimes. If you run into some of the loose items, ( *gg on not letting us use those for distractions yet it seems the more noise you make one them the more you seem to attract the ai* ) you get this glitch occasionally where the item noise sticks to you, not the item! I have gotten some cans stubbornly under my feet but the there are some larger things you walk by and the noise actually stays with you. You have to restart the game to make it go away, or suffer hearing it until the next cut scene."

Gameplay is awful. Stealth mechanics are flat out bad, combat is clunky, and the alien hugging your ass the entire game is a buzzkill. Furthermore, you'll regularly die to stupidity like Androids laying on the floor, but not actually dead, and be booted back to your last save which could be a mile behind you. It's an instant fail stealth system, and it single handedly kills the horror element when you've reloaded a save for the hundredth time.

I wanted to like this game, but it's the furthest thing from what I'd hoped for. I'm a gaming, and horror game veteran (if it's well known, I've likely played it) but this left me wanting. Even RE7 plays better than this game, and it's considerably less frustrating. Regarding Alien, I say you stick to Amnesia for your horror fill."

You have no choices to make.  The game tells you exactly where to go and what to do, and the alien is always 10 meters away.  You can take a train to different parts of the massive station, but the alien is always magically present in whatever part of the station you're in, if not in the same exact room.  And it never leaves.  You can wait half an hour and it will still be pacing around your location.  There's no logic to its behavior.  The game just puts it wherever you are.  And it's straight-up impossible to harm - even shotgun blasts have no effect on it.  It was billed as survival game, but so far it's more like a game of repeatedly being killed for no reason."
1124,3,0.5341,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I don't know why this game gets such good ratings. It's not fun, at all. Unless, you consider sneaking around, while avoiding monsters, and not having even the slightest clue where you're supposed to go, or what you're supposed to do, fun. You can't really explore, because the monster prevents you from doing so. It's stressful, boring, and the graphics are getting very dated. On that note, it'll probably run on your potato, without issue. For the price, I would definitely pass. I recommend waiting for a sale, or buying a cheap code. I got it for dirt cheap, and so I don't feel all bad about it. It's still ridiculously boring, though. Oh, and the control layout is terrible. At least, you can remap the keys. But, this is definitely not a fun game. Instead of cool graphics, and awesome scenery, you'll be staring at a pitch black screen, most of the time. Play it in the dark, is an absolute must. Personally, I didn't find it all that frightening. YMMV"

First it is scary as hell, after you get used to it its not so bad. Then just gets annoying and extremely boring.

It involves a lot hiding (fair enough), You can hide in lockers which slowly kills you because when the alein is checking out the locker you are hiding in you have to hold your breath otherwise it finds you (also Fair enough) but holding your breath kills you (WHAT? she must have some industrial disease if she can't hold her breath for 15 seconds?) and it is extremely repettitive and almost always checks the locker you are in but not other ones.

Also it gets you thinking how big the space station is but seems to follow you around? you think if he checks the same locker's 100 times it would get bored and try for someone else? No aparently not, it has a massive hard on for you and you alone. I watched a video of how the AI works and aparently the game knows where you are 100% but the AI dosen't so the game hints to where you are and the Alien runs around in circles around you. 
Sometimes it is rediculously fast (Fair enough it is fast) but sometimes you have no chance, nothing on the motion tracker then you see it blip so you try and hide but its moving that fast you can't possibly hide, sometimes its the luck of the draw because aparently it does things differently in other playthroughs so is somewhat random.
Overall I just get sick of hiding it gets to the point its not scary annymore and is just annoying."

- visuals are good
- sounds amazing

However, the gameplay kills all the fun and excitement. It is so frustrating and deceptive pushing me to stop, despite above very strong positive points:
- it has a very weak saving systems which generates very high frustration and discourage any attempt to try different approach, so you end up doing same repetitive & (very) boring approach: hide & seek, avoid all confrontation to be sure not to restart 5 minute sfrom where you are. 
- alien is very erratic: sometimes reacts as a strong disabled alien, unable to see/smell/hear you 2 feet away, other time very almighty, finding and killing from nowhere despite being hidden and having taken all precautions
- androids, feels they are just here to to counterbalance the alien in terms of ennemy
- inventory management could have been better

But is the game scary? Well, if you're not familiar with the series AT ALL it very well might be but I think most people know about the series, everyone has seen the Xenomorph, incredibly iconic design but not scary at this point, it may be a bit startling in the beggining as you're learning how the AI works, the first proper encounter with it in that medical area is pretty good and has some tension but dies off pretty quick.

If you can get it for like 10 bucks or less I'd say it's worth it just for the first third of the game but not full price in my opinion."
1140,3,0.58,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I really wish of a neutral vote, for this game. I higly suggest to check those reviews that actually talk about all the problems you will face during gameplay.

I'm gonna focus mainly on something those reviews doesn't touch and i think it's the first time i ever see such problem in a game; it does suffer of identity crysis, in my opinion. What do i mean?

Usually, you can easily explain what a game is about just using words that describes game genre; FPS, RPG, Metroidvania, Rougelike, Simulators.. and so on.
If you think of The Witcher 3 you would say that is an RPG, Action, Adventure. Those elements does stand for the whole game, since begin till end. If you think of Dishonored you can say is a Stealth game. 
There is a problem with Alien: Isolation; if you call it Survival Horror, you are talking about some parts of the game ignoring some; if you call it FPS, well, there are also parts that are about this.  
I'll be more specific; you can easily divide the game in those parts:

Pre-Flamethrower part: Basically the beggining of the game since you find the flamethrower; in this part the game does act as an Survival Horror Stealth game; you will be scared, you need to hide, you can use weapons at your own risk speically if the Xenomorph is near. This is basically the only part where i had actually fun and i was enjoying the game, and i was hella scared. The sounds are great, the atmoshere is great, the story starts to develop in a good way and you could be truly interested about it. It's also in this part where you start take a look to the core gameplay, the only thing of the gameplay that will follow you from the begin to the end; the Bob-the-Builder-simulation. Yeah. You will need to use buttons, repair stuff, pull levers, using terminals; this is the only part of the gameplay that will be in the game till the end.  

Post-Flamethrower; Then you find it, the flamethrower; the most op weapon in the game and the only thing you may ever need to complete it. Why it's so op? The Xenomorph is invunerable (why?...) and only fire does makes it goes away; and even if you can craft Molotov even before you find the flamethrower, i think that if you are on your first playthought you will not think about using it vs. the Xenomorph. But since the game wants you to find the flamethrower (you can't miss it) and it tells you that it works vs. Xenomorph, you will understand that fire does stop this monster. And also remove the horror part of the game. Because of the flamethrower, you aren't scared anymore from the Xenomorph; if it notices you, before you were dead; now you are like ""yeah bitch, come here, i'll burn your ass"". Horror part goes away, it ends there; you can't be scared anymore from the core NPC of the game that shall bring you fear. Now you have fire.

Post-Xenomorph-in-space: And then it goes really away. Oh my, so this is the end of the game? NO. There is more. But since Horror is over, now we move to FPS. Yeah. You will find a shotgun, and you will use vs. Androids. To kill them. Because now you can make noise. No need to use silence anymore (and so stealth is gone, too). No need to hide anymore. You can freely shoot there and here without problems. You wanna play stealth anyway? Do it, no problem. Now if they find you it's all good, you can even just run away from Androids/Humans since the monster can't kill you in seconds anymore.

I can go on with two more parts i think, but i have to make major spoilers and i don't want to. What i'm saying is that is ridicolous (i've never seen such thing before and i play games since 20 years) that a gameplay does change in this way removing core part of it; as i said, in a game i expect to scare me, it comes a point where you can't be scared anymore since you discover fire. And then the stealth part goes away since you don't need to hide and be quiet; you can just ""ramboing"" around.

I really like the sounds, the ambients, the music.. it's all good. But it's not enough if you change gameplay this much. Also, this game is way too long. It's the first game i was fucking praying to end. Every time you think it's about to end, there is more. And the final itelfs it's meh. It could have ended multiple times using as final any ""big"" moment in the game after Post-Xenomorph-in-space part... and it doesn't. It keeps add useless stuff, it goes full Bob-the-Builder-simulation, keeping add missions that are just boring and does not scare you anymore, since even when the monster appears it's all scripted. All. The. Damn. Times. It will appears always in the same point, will do the same things.

At the end, my vote is neutral. All the other problems that i totally agree with are written in other reviews. I can't reccommend it, but it's not a bad game. It just has so many problems."
1141,3,0.3926,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","""Alien: Isolation"" is the single most intense experience I've ever had playing a survival horror game. But, it's also the most frustrating. Not because of the game mechanics, I had no problem with the gameplay or the story, but this thing crashed every single time I would try to load a save file after I had died.
Because I was playing the game on ""Hard"", I had very little ammunition and the threat was much higher so I would die often, especially after ""Mission 7"", meaning the game would start crashing more and more. This resulted in many rage moments, but I never gave up as I wanted to finish this game despite the constant hurdles it was throwing at me.
This didn't turn out to be such a clever idea as in ""Mission 18"", the final mission, the game would crash its last crash. Nearing the end of the FINAL mission, I died and the game crashed which isn't anything new to me by that point, but now the game wouldn't even load the save file from the main menu after I restarted the game. After about 4 tries, I resorted to downloading a save file from the internet just so I could see the ending of the game.
Unfortunately, the save file was on ""Easy"" difficulty, meaning I didn't get the achievement for finishing the game on the hardest difficulty and I also didn't get the achievement for finishing the eigtheenth mission, which is completely unfair, but there was no other way I would see the ending.
It's not like I have a slow computer or anything, I've been playing the game on ""high"" settings throughout and no meddling in the settings fixed the crashing.
Due to these complications, I simply cannot force myself to recommend this game even though it is an excellent horror game, when it's not crashing."

Just after the movie came out I was looking at the film stills, reading the Alan Dean Foster adaptation, having nightmares, and wishing I was old enough that I could have got into the pictures to see it. And a few years later as a 1980's teenager, wanting to play a good computer game version.

So decades late, the game my teenage self wanted came out, and I loaded it up...
Pressing 'Q'  in first person through a long walking tutorial... with cutscenes.  20 minutes in, you learn to crouch. 30 minutes in, the game shows how I can use the three pieces of rubbish I picked up to make a medkit. 40 minutes in the game tells me how to lean left OR right.  50 minutes in, it gives you a torch and a tutorial on how to use a torch.  60 minutes in, it tells you to sneak into a room with one exit, then has four people with guns follow you in and shoot you.

I said something like ""Eff this boring... stuff"" and went to play a different game where I blew things up. So in one way it DID magically turn me back into that 1980's teenager!

Still, only 7 quid. I spent more than that on games I never managed to load from the cassette tape back then."

- Cannot jump because you could otherwise avoid enemies by climbing over obstacles, devs didn't want to code the AI to work around that
- Annoying crafting system
- Flashlight is useless, the battery lasts for like 3 minutes and it gives barely any light.
-- Inventory is very limited, you can only carry a very minimal amount of crafting materials and crafted items. Leads you to crafting items that you don't want to make yet, simply so you can loot more crafting material.
-- Save locations are extremely sparse, and you can't save at the save location twice in a row. This means you can easily lose a good 10-30 minutes of progress because you're playing stealthy and slow, but die before you get to the next save point.
- AI loves to cheat
-- AI loves to camp. Makes progressing a lot more annoying, because they won't stop guarding the doorways you need to get through.

1155,3,0.3849,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","While stellar atmosphere and an incredible amount of world and cool concepts put in makes me want to love Alien Isolation, a combination of vagueness about what does and doesn't make noises, and a sickeningly tight rubber band keeping the Alien on you leaves me feeling less like I'm in a stealth horror experience, and more in a trial of patience. More than once an Aliens spawn with rubber banding right when I was in a bad position left me feeling soft locked. Combine this reliance on luck with a conceptually cool but practically self destructively restrictive save system makes Alien Isolation painful to actually play.

1156,3,0.5935,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","(WARNING! The following review will contain spoilers from both Alien: Isolation and other entries in the Alien franchise. Read at your own risk)

Well, I had a to wait like a week before trying to review this one. Going into this game, I knew it was going to be a new playing field for me. I've played survival horror games in the past, but I normally elected to avoid survival horror games that emulated Amnesia's style; the inablilty to defend yourself, stealth and hiding over confrontation, etc. But after hearing about how this was the best Alien game in a long time, after watching Alien: Covenant and having mixed feelings about it (though I still sort of liked the movie), and hearing that the end of the Alien franchise may be looming as Disney eyes to acquire 20th Century Fox's IPs, I felt it was about time to play this thing, beat it, and now here I am reviewing it.

To summarize, the plot involves main protagonist Amanda Ripley (daughter of the lead heroine of the original Alien film series, Ellen Ripley) and is set roundabout 16 years after the finish of the original Ridley Scott movie that began the franchise. Immediately, you learn that she has been working around where her mother has disappeared following the destruction of the Nostromo. And Samuels, a Weyland-Yutani synthetic, invites her to examine the recently recovered flight recorder from the Nostromo, which is kept at a station called Sevastapol...Sevastopol? One of the two. And all hell breaks loose when she finally gets there.

Now, I was skeptical about playing an Alien game after we were butt-fucked by the dog-shit cock sandwich known as Aliens: Colonial Marines given its shit story, outdated graphics, poor gameplay, and other fucker-y, but for Alien: Isolation proved that a good game can be made within the IP. The atmosphere is tense, the graphics are incredible (even four years later and running on a GTX 1060), and attention to detail in regards to the environment and general art direction to make the game look and feel like the original film is impeccable. Creative Assembly (known mostly for strategy games, like the Total War franchise) pulled off something incredible when they made this game.

Positives:
+ The game is scary and intense; focusing on horror over action is what makes this game work
+ The graphics are phenomenal
+ Great homage to the Ridley Scott film

Now, you're probably wondering why I hit the thumbs down in this review when I've given this much praise. Well, the game is good...but it's not perfect. There are bugs still (something that comes with building a game engine from the ground up, and making a game outside the studio's forte'), like animation glitches, and getting suddenly discovered by enemies even when you're completely quiet in hiding.

Let me tell you something that is a mixed bag. The Xenomorph(s)'s depiction in this game is the absolute pinnacle of antagonist's in a game for a while. For comparison, this generation's Nemesis (Resident Evil 3), or Pyramid Head (Silent Hill 2). The game is scary when dealing with bad human survivors or Seegson's Working Joe's (two enemy types that I really hated and didn't make sense to me), but when that Xenomorph shows up, the horror in this game reaches petrifying levels. When that Alien shows up, you better fucking keep your eyes AND your ears open. So, Gearbox, this game shows how truly terrifying the Xenomorph can be. So for scares, tension, and just being the overall eponymous entity that we've known since 1979, the AI, agression, and overall aesthetic of this Xenomorph, this guy takes the cake for being the scariest videogame villain so far. Big +.

On the other hand, this guy makes the game way too difficult. Too much time gets spent hiding under beds, in lockers, under desks before this guy decides to get a move on to some other place, and sometimes, this guys just pops back in the same place after only a minute. ""Look, Mr. Xenomorph. I know your job is to make me work to beat this game, but what the everloving shit? I'm playing on Medium! MEDIUM!!!""

Negatives:
- The presence of hostile human survivors and hostile androids make no sense to me.
- Movement and control glitches.
- Too hard even on low difficulties.
- The characters are rather stale. Other than Ripley herself (and even then, still rather stale) and maybe Samuels, it's kinda hard to form an attachment to characters who we barely get to know, and there are some that we start to get attached to...only to be GoT'd or George R.R. Martin'd off. Damn it, Ric****. Shoulda packed a motion tracker.
- Bad voice acting. So bad. Like really, really bad. Even A. Ripley's voice actress seemed to have a hard time maintaining consistency.
- The biggest negative of this game, however (not the length, bugs, or characters, mind you) is what the game's story contributes to the overall universe of Alien. And that kinda deserves its own rant.

The game is good, yeah, but does its story do anything for the universe as a whole? The films all had their input in main protagonist E. Ripley's journey (some good, some bad). But did A. Ripley's do anything? Not at all. Much like the Sequel Trilogy of Star Wars, or the Jurassic Park follow-ups, Jurassic World, the tale is rather.....hard to place.

In addition, to those who watched the director's cut of Aliens know A. Ripley lives til 66. Something my brother pointed out was why the incident was never mentioned by Burke and why he was just a dick to Ripley about keeping promises. A Weyland-Yutani secret to be buried? Or simply something that was overlooked in trying to craft this game that destroys its place in the Alien universe? Either way, there's no closure or connection, making Alien: Isolation a loophole in that universe.

Perhaps if a Creative Assembly makes a sequel that can wrap up that dick move of a cliffhanger, we can place it somewhere in league with the films.

So to generalize:

If you like the Amnesia-style survival horror game, with little to know fighting and focus on stealth: Play it. Its good.
If you're a casual Alien fan: Play it. Its interesting.
If you're a hardcore Alien fan: Pass this over. Can't connect any dots here.

Unless you're that kind of franchise fan that likes to pick and choose which parts that you acknowledge happen, this isn't for you. As for me, I'm willing to say that if this was adapted to film, I'd say its better than Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection, and Alien: Covenant, but it comes nowhere close to the first two films. As I said, this is a hard recommendation for several factors. Let's just see if Creative Assembly does a sequel to wrap this all up nicely. Only time will tell that one..."
1157,3,0.6201,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Play the First 6-8 hours and then stop. That's the real actual good part of the game. The next 12-14 hours after that is horrifying and not in a good way. Increidibly faithful to the ALIEN universe. But I really would love to know what went through the develpers heads when they decided to make this the longest single player horror game ever. This game could have been so amazing in a tight 7-10 hour campaign and even then.

I was so excited when I read about how advanced the Xenomorph's AI was. It's not. This game amounts to a life-and-death version of Hide-and-Seek.

You play Amanda Ripley, the adorable toddler who [i]thinks[/i] she's got daddy fooled when she's hiding under the bed. Daddy is played by a beautifully-rendered and scary-looking Xenomorph. He plays along really well; he knows where you are the whole time but he's just waiting for you to giggle so he can catch you and tickle you to pieces.

Once I realized I was just playing Hide-and-Seek with daddy, the game lost all horror and became kinda funny. The rest of the game, so far, is mind-numbingly predictable and cliche. The game's appeal, far as I can guess, draws on nostalgia from the original Alien movie and an over-hyped Xenomorph AI that isn't nearly as scary as it should be, and I'm playing on Hard. It's not hard. I'd play Nightmare, but if it just means more hiding in lockers waiting for the dumb Xenomorph to go back into the vents and give me about 10 seconds to run to another locker, no thanks.

They didn't try very hard to make this game great, but it sure is pretty. And so 80s! Just look at all the old video game joysticks and stuff lying around! And those old computers! And VHS film grain! Too bad they didn't put that much effort into the gameplay."

I like this game's story, environments, and premise however I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends cuz of bugs bunny:

Hitboxes are messed up... Some vents I have to fiddle around with for 20 secs because the hitbox to get in is so small, leaving my but whole wide open for the alien to come.

Sound triggers are extremely poor in some areas. I was minding my own business in a corridor, alien nowhere near me and for no reason the music just strikes up and deafens me - when nothing is happening. Also when I equip the flamethrower and look around, it sounds like two horses

event triggers are also buggy, once had to wiggle against a door just to get an objective to update

A really good one is when a hostile human shot at me, so I burned his bottom to a crisp with a molotov. I feel accomplished and then the screen turns black and says ""gg idiot, don't kill innocent civilians..."" yh cuz an innocent civilian would shoot me. That one set me back about 10 minutes of progress lol :DD

about 20% of the time, the game waits an extra 0.2 secs before it detects my mouse movement

a few doors also blend in with walls, making it hard to see them. navigation is a bit backwards in this game. Backtracking is fine but when your map has poor boundaries it gets annoying having to guess the way back rolf

a few humans you meet along the way are there for, well, no reason at all. Saw some woman sitting on a bench out in the open - her only interaction was a bland voice line about how she was going to die or something. Ok cool, thanks for the lack of basic human integrity... Missed opportunity to have the character ask her something common sense like ""why aren't you hiding for safety?"" Takes some of the humanity out of the game and makes the humans seem like the same as the androids - mindless machines. Interactions with fellow humans in this game are a bit cringy; it ignores the basic psychology of humans and sometimes the ai will just 360 and shoot you even though you're crouched making no sounds

The game was creepy because of its atmosphere and it didn't have to rely on cheap jumpscares to get under your skin. The environment of a destroyed space spation really immersed me as a player, and I really felt like I was in danger when the Alien was slowling lurking near me. The motion tracker was a unique touch that added to the creepy factor.

However, the game loves itself too much that it starts getting repetitive really quickly. It's always the same thing. A door you need to cross is locked either by a keycard or a password. You must navigate through this well-constructed level in order to find said keycard/password. Sometimes the power fails, so you must turn on the generator. It's this back and forth throughout the same level that makes it dull the more you play. Add that to the Alien's questionable field of view and the horrid placements of the save points and the game becomes a chore as you replay the same thing over and over again. Furthermore, the game doesn't know when to stop. It just keeps getting stretched out to the fullest extent clearly putting quantity over quality as I felt the last few missions had no point to them other than making the game longer. As for the story, it's there, but it's really not important. The game has a few subplots that you don't really care about since the game just forgets about them until the end when they resurface all of a sudden.

Some parts of this game (I did not complete it) are quite good, particularly when you progress through it and see new places and characters. But it's built on horror, and the horror is flawed.

It's flawed because of the Alien's programming. Wherever you are in Sevastopol, the Alien will follow. I took a train ride to somewhere very far away, next thing I know, I hear BANG BANG BANG on the roof and sure enough, the Alien has followed me there.

Once you see the pattern, it immediately loses its novelty, and gets repetetive and boring. For a game built on this one creature, its code needed to be way more advanced. Moreover, the way the Alien moves around while you're hiding is not too sophisticated - you know, jerky movements sometimes, it just looks a bit ridiculous, as it stands a few metres away.

IT BECOMES LESS HORROR, AND MORE / ALL PUZZLE. Yep, it loses the horror element. The androids are actually more scary, in my opinion."

But  that's just me, so if u don't mind some combat in your horror games, then it should be  fine, but even though I'm a big fan of 1979 alien, and this game recaptures that feeling well, I just couldn't get into the game play unfortunately.  
Some of the extra modes like replaying the scenes from the 1979 film were qutie good, short and to the point, but the main game goes on way too long.  About 20 hrs I'm told, I couldn't sit through it, this was a chore to play.
Most horror games I've played are less than 10 hours, so if there were a 'director's cut' that was trimmed down significantly I think it would benefit greatly, as even big fans of this type of horror game will tell you, it's just too long.  

Anyway, don't buy this for a chance to revisit 1979 alien alone, you have to like this type of game, otherwise stay well clear.

1175,1,0.5091,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","(Warning) This game is not about shooting aliens, is about hide and survive.

PROS: The enviroment and the plot are very interesting, it is loyal to the Orignal Alien Saga, also de characters and the interactions are awesome, cause each of them has a rol in in the game that warrant the succes of the character during the game. 

CONS: Most of the game you are hiding like a rat from everybody, YES, not only the alien but from everybody (you cannot even read the stories cause it can catch you all the time).  The game is too repetitive ( hide, unlock doors, the power is not enough so go back to the first place were you merely survive, something goes wrong and now you are in the bottom), the alien most of the time is going to be at the one way you need to complete every mission, is anoying and umpredictable. You have weapons but are useless cause they dont even work againts the alien, and you cant use them cause make a lot of noise and the alien kill you (all the fucking time), the falemthrower and the molotov are the only useful weapons but you never have enough ammo, the map (to know where you have to go) never works, never. The most enjoyable part of the game is when there isnt any alien (it says everything). Finnaly I have to say I finished it in the hardest difficulty so maybe if u want to enjoy it you shouldnt play it on that difficulty."
1176,1,0.3122,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","This game is a masterpiece of bad gameplay design, it should've been part of the Telltale series rather than having you to play it with all these cutscenes , quick-time events and scripted moves included.
The atmosphere and immersion are incredible, it's better than watching a movie from the series, soundtrack and lighting made this game really scary
But every part of the game you feel like a clumsy rat or cockroach that has nowhere to hide. You're in constant fear, you can't fight back and when you do it's never rewarding. Basically if you're seen it means another save reload.
Humans are the least powerful enemy but they are always better equipped than you with guns and are able to run faster. 
A lot of quick time events and animations ruined this game for me. God forbid you start hacking or rewiring not to mention cutting a door with the torch and you hear or see something with the corner of your eye, it's impossible to get out of the animation and by the time it finished the starting animation and you begin the cancelling animation you're either already dead or gonna be dead in the next seconds. 
Androids even towards the end of the game where you get most gear, are still incredibly hard to kill taking 15-20 hits with the wrench to kill and trust me they're very slow hits while the android grabs you and you're pressing E quick time events to get away, or 6-8 revolver shots slash 4-6 shotgun shots to the head to kill which you can imagine it's ridiculous, they're not Iron mongers, they should be just androids who died easily in the Alien movies or at least got impaired.
Everything feels tedious, it's supposed to be a stealth survival game but the wait times are absurd for a camera or an android to pass a position. The alien is always in the vicinity and even if the sound is made by the system or an enemy, he's still after you like it's your fault for everything it happens
You can't sprint, you either run or walk so when there's some action that requires you to be fast it's not possible, same with climbing ladders, very slow
You just clear an area fighting 4 androids and when you backtrack from doing a quest the same area will be respawned with those androids again
In the later stages of the game there are so many scripted events with aliens popping in your face that I almost predicted them all. Of course I got jump scared, there's no doubt about that but there was always that feeling it was gonna happen.
Being so many of these creatures around, the ammo for your flamethrower is so scarce that if you used it previously in a scene and then you have to pass a section and you encounter aliens, there's no ammo for you, with no option but death, you can't scare them away, you don't have the means and you can't even get them from anywhere or craft
Too bad they had to rely on you being handicaped throughout the game so they can add those extra gameplay hours just from deaths and reloads or backtracking most part of the game
Bottom line is that the game is good if you're a fan of the souls games. Just joking, but if you're a sodomist, play it. Otherwise you'll find yourself raging at every damn alarm or thing that falls off which collapses everything on your head.
The most disappointing part is that the game doesn't make you feel like a hero, like the movie main character, you don't feel like Ripley, you don't feel in charge, you don't feel like you'll escape or overcome this task and either save or sacrifice yourself for the good of humanity, you just feel powerless and unsignificant and that's depressing, frustrating, shouldn't belong to a video game, this should've been a thriller with horror accents, not a drama"
1177,2,0.4084,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","[h1]Alienated..[/h1]

I'll preface this by saying that in the genre (First person horror games with deadly foes), this is probably one of the best ones out there. Still, I can't really recommend it. The atmosphere is great, it has good sounds and music (although I find the abuse of music and sound to scare you to be a little obnoxious, making it hard to hear the actual warning sounds at times), and the level design ranges from good to ok (the design is a little too ""recursive"" at times, and on the long run feels a little too repetitive, with the omni-present air ducts being where you'll spend a good chunk of your time a tad too often).

 The true problems lie in the design of the enemy AIs. You'll face humans (rarely), androids (very commonly) and the titular Alien, which overstays its welcome whenever it's around, although you won't be dealing with him for most of the game, I'd say.

What's the problem? Well, the game almost lies about humans not always being hostile. If someone isn't obviously friendly, expect to be shot, maybe after a couple of warnings (sorry buddy, but I need to go through here). Humans are rare, as I said, so they are hardly a big problem, just disappointing.

Androids are okay...ish. The normal version is stupid and semi-blind, but with the claustrophobic design of the levels, it can still be hard to avoid them. They aren't too bad as enemies, and eventually you'll gain ways to handle them if you don't want to play cat and mouse anymore. Sadly, there is another version, which is extremely annoying: EMP-resistant, fire-resistant, extremely harder to kill, with super hearing and sight. They are introduced in a section where they take your weapons away, to top it all off, so really, great work (thanks for making me waste time at first, how was I supposed to know all of my gadgets except the bombs are useless?). You eventually get your sweet revenge on those, when you get your weapons back, but at that point, they are just a nuisance, so hardly anything to be happy about.

The alien(s? ;p) is just annoying. The AI rubber-bands around you pretty hard, constantly cheating by knowing your exact position while also having to pretend it doesn't know. Since it can instantly kill you, homing-in on you that way would be a show-stopper, so it circles around, sometimes in a comical fashion, refusing to ever leave you enough room to do your thing.

There are gadgets to distract it and the other enemies, but they are useful only once in a blue moon. Good luck tossing a noise maker when it's so close that you need to distract it, while at the same time having A) a place to hide from where to toss the item; B) a good spot where to toss the item, since it needs to be away from you, your goal and C) not cause the alien to walk in on you and get you, You can place the noisemaker, but it's not like you can know beforehand when you'll need it (the alien is very random and erratic in its appearances and movements), so forget about it. Supposedly the AI can learn to see through your schemes, but I can't really see myself using these tricks enough times for it to learn anything, it's just easier and more reliable to stealth around carefully (although the random nature of the alien WILL screw you over, every once in a while, for no fault of your own).

The only good items are the offensive ones which work much better in a bind, and which can be placed to better effect (if you need to guard your back, it's fine to use them as mines, since you can pick them on your way back if unused).

You can't kill the alien, only scare it away with fire (and you don't get the required items for this right away). I hear you can use normal weapons too, but you need to unload a lot of damage, and I never managed to pull it off myself. Weapons are better saved for the other enemies, anyway, which can be terminated. Overall, the Alien is only difficult because of its insta-kill powers, otherwise its greatest threat is its randomness. You can predict what's going to happen, outwait him or outmaneuver him most of the times, but sometimes it will just get you, and you'll have to eat the bullet (and restart from the previous save).

The greatest flaw of this type of AI, though, is that it breaks the rhythm of the game. You get long, ANNOYING sections with no respite, to the point where the tension gives way to impatience, and the calm areas feel quite less scary, and often are too short before getting into the cat and mouse affair, over and over again.

If you don't want to design this aspect of the game too carefully, at the very least you should leave more control to the players, with safe areas that are actually safe, and better ways to really deal with the enemies. You can achieve tension in other ways, by having more limited resources, and sections which are more dangerous, but where the enemy doesn't psychically know where you are all the time. I really, REALLY wish sometimes we'd get the alien simply protecting a door, and we being able to prepare a distraction to get past it, using the usually useless radios, screens, and other interactables of the maps. These are even less useful than your gadgets, being activated mostly when you are near them, and being fixed in place.

While the map design is overall fine (and greatly atmospheric) the goals of the game are pure janitorial stuff. You'll always have (and NEED, because of the confusing, sometimes too similar corridors) a pointer to your next objective, even when you shouldn't really know where it is (especially when you don't even have a map of the area yet XD). The interaction with the world is limited, almost laughable: the only interesting ones are the electronic terminals where you can activate certain elements in the maps, or read more about the people on the station, the rest are annoying mini-games and semi-QTEs, and you'll be pulling enough levers to last you a lifetime.

You don't really have the opportunity to lie a trap, close an enemy into a room, or make them fall to their doom, you can only do very straightforward things (with extremely rare, almost unique chances to get two different types of AIs to meet and fight each other).

The designers clearly knew the faults of this system, and start disseminating saving spots every minute or so in the later stages, a sign that they knew most people would probably die often in the areas where the alien AI is the most aggressive.

Another negative mark are the ""walking sim"" sections. I can remember at least 4, and 3 of them are quite obviously just that (so you don't really get too tense/scared). Quite honestly, I would have preferred cutscenes, in their place.

The story is okay. It's not going to blow your mind, but fans of the movies will appreciate it, and it's definitely interesting to learn about Ripley's daughter. I feel like we could have gotten some more character discovery/development, but the narrative is not bad by any means.

Overall, I don't recommend it, but fans of this very specific genre might actually enjoy it. I just wish it wasn't so annoying, it could be easier to give players better visual audio feedback and more warning, if you really want to keep this type of AI, or go for a less chaotic/random design altogether, but as it is, I have enjoyed too little of it.

P.S. The number of hours played is a little too high, because I had left it idle at one point to get cards, and I also lost some of my saves once, because I had disabled the cloud saving, resulting in me having to replay a few sections)."

ALSO the missions that you actually do stuff, you don't know what she's doing or fixing because it's something far to technical to understand, there's literally mission after mission that all you do is follow the destination marker because that's all you know whats going on.

But the AI -which is center stage in what is basically a 1v1 asymmetrical horror game- falls far short of anything approaching engaging.

It might be different on difficulties other than Nightmare, but in that mode it is painfully obvious the Alien isn't intelligent: it's scripted. It will circle for half an hour if you find a good enough hiding spot without ever finding you, but will immediately follow you to another area when you move. It will ALWAYS find you in a locker. If the creature isn't on your screen, isn't making noise or even on the motion detector, get in a locker for a few minutes and it will come straight to that locker and kill you. Hiding under tables works the same. But, emblematic of the inconsistency you'll be dealing with, circling desks, lockers, or small benches opposite the alien will keep it from seeing you. Sometimes it will spot you like a falcon at noon, sometimes it literally doesn't have vision. The ""Don't run"" tip it throws at you in loading screens is woefully misguided, with a duck and run strategy being so effective it feels downright exploitative sometimes. If the alien is down from the vents and more than 20 feet away, it won't run after you for noise (or check out your flashbangs or noisemakers in my experience). So if you have a path to your objective and are around a corner you can just jog out of the level. I think having the alien make mistakes like checking lockers you aren't in would've gone miles to hiding the flaws in its AI, but as it is it's brutally obvious the game is telling the alien where you are at all times and then deciding how much it wants to mitigate that knowledge. I don't expect the devs to have created a sentient AI, but trying to hack a shortcut to the end result of intelligence is just brutal.

The game's entire atmosphere leans on the alien, and rightfully so, but the creature is so obviously flawed that the whole game collapses. I finished the game to give it a proper chance because I like the franchise and genre, but doing more than one level a day was pulling teeth."

My thought was if it's like the movies, it would be kinda fun hunting down aliens and putting up defensive turrets and having big battles.  But this is purely a stealth and avoidance game.   At first, the alien was kind-of frightening and cool, but after a few hours of playing it became tedious and annoying for me.  

The objectives are rather lame:  open this door, open that door, seal this compartment, turn off this breaker, collect this item, meet up with this person, collect these supplies, deviver them here, and on an on.  And between these objectives is space to have to crawl through very slowly, hide, crwal some more, sneak around the alien, crawl some more.  If the alien gets too close, then blast it with the flame thrower and crawl some more.  All until you get to that objective, complete it and them move on to the next object and follow the exact same pattern.  And if you die, then you have to start over at the last save point and do all of that SLOW TEDIOUS crawling all over again.  

The atmostphere was good.  The sound effects with the creaks and cracks and squeaking and walking of the alien was well done. Graphics were good for a game of its age.  Was it fun?  No, not really.  I found it rather annoying.  In fact, there were some places where I looked at the clock and wished I could get to that next save point so I could stop playing and do something else.  That is a sign the entertainment just isn't very good.  

Again, I WOULD recommend this game if your thing is the horor genre and you enjoy a LOT of stealth.   But since I really didn't like that, I do not recommend this game for anyone who likes shooting and action and adventure."
1190,3,0.3587,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I'll start with the positives of this game: the Alien's A.I. and the crafting system. Both of these elements are really surprising because they innovate the horror genre. I've never seen a monster A.I. in a game that acts randomly instead of walking around on railroad tracks. The alien will turn, backstrack for no reason, wander around in no set path, etc. This feels extremely realistic and immersive. It also raises the tension level dramatically and ups the challenge of the game, which is where the crafting system comes into play. You can pick up materials, then combine them in a unique and clever crafting system to make gadgets  that can help you: flashbangs, noisemakers, etc. I loved this mechanic and thought it had a lot of potential to add more dynamic elements to the static survival horror genre, as opposed to the tired old hiding and puzzle solving. 

The problem with this game is mainly the fact that both of these elements are not implemented well. The A.I., while excellent, is FAR too overtuned. At times it feels like the Alien cheats, running right to where you are hiding and killing you because it randomly decided to go back and explore the spot it just found no one in two seconds ago. One time the Alien burned itself on some fire I did not create (it had no logical reason to know where I was), got pissed off, and ran straight towards me to kill me. It ALWAYS hovers right near you in almost every single section of the game. With it's super hearing, this makes running or doing basically anything other than stealth and throwing noisemakers pointless. There is no sense of pacing, of letting the players have some time to peacefully walk around and adjust so that the alien is scary again next time by contrast. This game is constant, high octane action, and it will burn you out very fast. And because the Alien is so perfect and unbeatable, the crafting element (which is mainly only useful for dealing with the RARE enemy robot and human sections) feels like a pointless chore more than anything else.

Most of this game felt like a slog. The sections with the Alien were the worst parts because you will most likely die at least 50 times to RNG. Even with the flamethrower, which allows you to scare the alien off, the game is still stupid hard. It will just run away and then come back from a different angle 5 seconds later (some repellent). Other times the Alien's A.I. bugs out and doesn't react to the fire at all, or kills you because its hiding in a vent but not dripping acid to show you that its there like its supposed to. I feel like this game is a dying simulator. Especially when you're in an area with hostile robots chasing you, humans, AND the alien. Basically any sound at all instantly attracts the alien to kill you, so you just can't do anything or use any gadgets against those enemies in these situations. Fun. 

My favorite parts were the ones with the working joes. You basically do combat against robots by building devices and using gadgets, crafting, clever traps, etc. This really plays to the strength of the crafting system and felt very innovative. Sadly, these parts are few and far between.

I'd only reccomend this game to hardcore Alien franchise fans and/or those who want an extremely difficult challenge. Be aware there is TONS of backtracking, little story, and most of the gameplay is slowly making your way through hallways to a QTE objective that isn't even a true puzzle, then going backwards to do a different QTE objective. The story drags ridiculously long as well, with 18 chapters plus DLC. Most of it feels pointless, padded, and extremely repetitive. 

I wish this game took more cues from Amnesia, with intelligent puzzles and good pacing. Alien: Isolation certainly (over)uses the stealth mechanic, but has the overall feel of Outlast. I think it could've been better if it had less alien in general, maybe saving it for the ending, or just had more fair A.I. that wasn't such a chore to deal with. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention, there are facehuggers as well and they are extremely unfair/annoying. They glitch out and can be invisible/invincible as they scuttle on the ground under objects, on top of spawning in ludicrous places such as right behind you. If you get hit, it's a one hit kill, so one particular section with tons of facehuggers can feel like a nightmare of mouse-throwing insanity."
1191,1,0.6479,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I couldn't even get to the point where the alien appears. That's how bad this game is.

First off, the logos when you start the game. Every time you start it, you have to sit through the same four or five unskippable logos with grainy filter. I really don't care who made it, I want to try the game.

Then you start playing and immediately the motion sickness appears. There's this head-bobbing and blurring that just makes you ill. While you can turn the blur off, you need to actually look up a fix for the head-bobbing, and even that doesn't completely remove it. You just learn to play it in bursts so you don't get a headache.

For a game that's supposed to be about running around and hiding from enemies, it's not very fluid. You want to run and dive into a vent? Nope, you have to press E on the vent and then she can do a slow entry animation while you're getting shot. You're standing too close to the vent? Well, you can't press E, so you better back up a bit until it gives you the option. A ladder at the end? No, you don't just climb it automatically, you have to press E again to get the climbing animation going. Even crouching feels sticky and like she's having to break her knees first before they can behind. And running is nothing but listening to her panting all the time.

Then there's doors. Opening them is fine, you walk over and they take a few seconds to decide to do anything and then you pass through. But if you try to go back out while the door's closing, you have to wait for the closing animation to finish so it can re-do the opening animation from the start again. There's a locked door? First, press E on it, then hold down both mouse buttons, then press A for no reason. Yup, there's animations for that, too. You could probably picklock an actual door faster than she unlocks them.

Saving is just as slow. You can only save at certain locations in the game, which I guess was to make you feel like you were more at risk when you die. I think Dead Space had it too, but it just doesn't work well. You have to walk over and put your keycard in, then you wait for ages for the three lights to disappear, and THEN you get the option to save. No hurry, love, you take your time!

And to really show how slow it is, early on you're following a guy through the vents. You're faster than him but he's blocking the way and slowing the whole thing down so he can give exposition. Then, at one point, the cheeky git turns around and motions for you to ""catch up"". CATCH UP? I've been following behind you for 10 minutes waiting for you to get out of the way.

I've been told the alien is scary, but I didn't get to see it. The game's too clunky, too focused on using terminals every chance it can, to be entertaining. If you want scary, go for Amnesia: The Dark Descent."

It never felt like there were reliable ways to deal with opponents, no matter what combinations of tactics I tried. A horror game remains scary only while it can keep you afraid of dying. Once you've died too many times you are no longer afraid of death and see it only as a game. A game with poorly executed gameplay. I cannot express my disappointment enough. I was really looking forward to this game after hearing so many good things about it. Once the poor gameplay shattered the atmosphere for me, there was nothing left."
1198,1,0.3643,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Not much fun and rather uninteractive.

Glaring plot holes aside (Prometheus and Covenant made swiss cheese out of the entire Alien universe already) the game is just not that good at what it aspires to be.

It's not good stealth, as you can't really distract enemies or use alternate routes, so hiding under a table or in a locker until the game decides you have had enough suspense is your only option. It's not good survival as your tools and weapons are largely useless (it takes six revolver bullets to take down one basic android) and you pretty much have to rely on hiding and healing occasional wounds with medpacks (more often than not the medpacks are no good because if you triggered the bad you'll just die before you reach safety). It's not good adventure because you merely run around pushing buttons and pulling levers, while being peppered with scripted jump scares and have no agency of your own.

Just to reiterate - the game never presents you with a problem that you need to solve with the tools, knowledge and resources you have. It always gives you a direct order on the scale of ""Push that button, pull that lever, watch that cutscene"".

There is a semblance of exploration where you'll pass by doors and rooms that aren't accessible just yet but will be accessible later with better equipment but the plot and lack of resources push you forward.

And everything that Ripley does she does because she's smart and an engineer and you, the player, just watch helplessly, having no idea of why or how this particular big thing must be done. The internal logic of the game is flawed at times. If it is highlit in orange, it is interactive and you must aim at it, press your use key and do the QTE. If it is not highlit you must wander around and try to find something that is interactive, so that that first thing becomes interactive.

The amount of running back and forth merely for the sake of more jump scares becomes ridiculous towards the end of the game, too. Push nine buttons, run across the level, pull a lever... ow, shucks, now you must run back (in the darkness, with an alien around) and pull a lever in the same place you came from, then return to the lever you pulled before that.

Even Doom 3 (not to mention System Shock 1/2) had a much better gameplay flow. And that says something."
1199,2,0.3243,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","This is one of the worst games I have ever had the displeasure of playing. You are forced to move at a snails pace if you wish to avoid combat with enemies. To properly utilize any of the almost non-existent stealth elements, which are nominal due to every enemy's spectacular visual acuity, you must remain crouched and tap forward one movement after another. If you do decide to fight you will win against every enemy even though the gunplay is sad and painfully innacurate, and with the exception that aliens are invulnerable to damage not involving fire. Aliens are also the most common enemies and oneshot you every time you are spotted. I reccomend you throwdown your keyboard and do something else until the minute long animation and loading from your last save is complete. This game is pathetically slow in every aspect. Every object's corner extends out a foot with an invisible wall that will block progress as you siddle your way through slightly filled corridors. The mig welder is distractingly common, easily the most I have ever viewed a single filler object throughout a videogame. Must have been 30+ throughout the game. Any sembelance of fear is ruined after the first few deaths to the alien. I simply gave up whenever it came to kill me, as it's a oneshot without being burned anyways. The facehugger is also an absurdley overpowered opponent. It can walk through many different objects on the ground, which in combination with its miniscule height makes it invisible to the player. All elements of quest completion are homogenous and consist of using some random thingymajig on a new doohickey, which is done with a combination of keyboard presses and at times involve using a computers utility function to open the ability to access said items. The ""story"" is absolutely atrocious, not even worth mention. The end area of the game is also not worth words. The game is very visually appealing, so I would recommend making yourself invulnerable and pretending it's Dear Esther if you have any wish to play it."
1200,2,0.4464,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","The game is beautiful. The plot is excellent.

The execution is poor.

Apart from the thrill of the Alien vanishing fairly soon after it arrives, once you realise it's not dynamic AI, it's simply walking about the same routine area you're in, the magic vanishes.

If you sit and watch long enough, the Alien pretty much follows the same routine, and only reacts, rather predictably, to your noise.

The actual forced gameplay is also very poor.

The example I can best give, is that you don't get a firearm until you find one on a desk, and there's a little in-game animation to show the importance of finding it. Yet prior to this point, I had successfull planned and killed four people with the wrench. From each one I had scavenged a pistol and lots of ammunition. I couldn't use the pistol until I 'officially' found it in game, and when I did, the ammunition I had found wasn't there - I was left with the forced find low ammo count.

That is a developer trying to force you to play the game they want you to, which for something as hyped as this as being a dynamic game, is wrong.

I don't recommend."

garbage game. Here are some points to think about:
- Super linear, go here do this, go there do that, no choices, no alternate routes, no exploring
- everthing scripted
- buggy as hell - ingame menus look like watching TV from an antenea with terrible reception with text bobbing up and down, and static all over. APARENTLY, NVIDIA cards are not supported and NVIDIA doesnt support this game with its newest cards, ***SEE NVIDIA SUPPORTERD GAMES WEBSITE***
- bad voice acting, terrible cut scenes (most), annoying characters, unbelievable/unrealistic story progression and actor choices.
- bad user controls, NO JUMPING, NO CLIMBING
- awkward user interface - cant sheath items/weapons resulting in using them accidentally,
- dumb crafting system
- STUPID jump-scares always at a conveinient time to try to startle you which after the first 20 or so you realize are far too coincidental and quickly become stale.
- NOT SCARY
- No light-super dark areas, and flashlight batteries expend quicker than running a spotlight off a watch battery
- obtaining weapons makes you feel more vulnerable than you did before having any weapons at all
- Game does NOT-NOT-NOT-NOT feel like an ALIEN movie
- I could probably go on.

1205,3,0.3908,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I just couldn’t finish this title, and I don’t fully understand why people are so enamored with it. Sure, I’m a fan of the series, and yes there are sections of the game that are fantastic, but the gameplay is way to repetitive, slow, and convoluted. 

The first two/three hours are awesome and well designed, as you carefully navigate a large, abandoned space station while attempting to avoid groups of human survivors, rogue androids, and eventually the Alien. The initial encounters with the organism are thrilling, as you duck under tables and hide in lockers, hoping it won’t find you. Sometimes it’ll drop from a ceiling vent, look around and start hissing, giving you just enough time to find a safe hiding spot. Other times it’ll just pop up out of nowhere and kill you. It’s challenging and somewhat frustrating, but also extremely repetitive. 

About half way through the game, you’re forced to navigate a medical facility, and this is where things really started to slow down: ”My scanner is going off, I better keep an eye out, just in case...looks like it’s getting closer...oh shit there it is quick hide! Oh nos it got me!” 

<four hours later> 

“Scanner beeping / hide / move / beeping / hide / move / yawn”
  
After the umpteenth time hiding in a locker or trying to avoid the overly Alien, I realized I just didn’t care anymore, and the initial thrill of hide and seek was gone. Eventually you obtain a flame thrower, which makes encounters with the Alien easier, but you’re still trying to avoid it as you can burn through fuel pretty quickly. And some levels convolutedly force you to explore each area, looking for an item or a dead crew member, or will simply strip away your weapons, “Oh look now it’s hard mode” style. 
 
The crafting system is cool, and actually useful, but I found the lack of materials keeps it from really being awesome. You have the option of either saving your crafted items for difficult situations, in which you might not have the correct one, or using them on a regular basis and always being out of stuff. You also (convolutedly) can only carry a limited number of materials, so you’ll often be forced to pass up crafting items that you find. 

If you’re a fan of survival games, you’ll probably love it. Otherwise, I’d wait until it’s on sale to pick it up.

1210,1,0.5265,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Alien Isolation is largely a mixed bag for me. There are games which have huge issues, be it bugs, questionable design choices etc. and I still love them for their pros e.g. story, atmosphere etc. AI is obviously a labour of love, made by a bunch of dedicated fans who happen to know how to create video games. At the same time, they seem to not know how to effectively invite players into their world, maintain tension or know when to stop.

The game looks stunning. The space station was painstakingly made to appear as if taken straight from the first Alien movie. This helps create and maintain a thick, foreboding atmosphere throughout the playthrough.
The sound design is equally as amazing. Playing it with good headphones is a must to appreciate all the details and effort that went into it.
The alien is, at first, absolutely terrifying. The way it stomps around, hisses, jumps into and out of ventilation shafts and even kills you, is nightmare fuel.
Story wise it's ok and ties up a few loose ends that were present in the franchise.

On the other hand...
The learning curve in this game is f*cking vertical. When you read the negative reviews, you will notice the same theme reoccurring time and time again: the infamous Medical wing. You enter the wing around 1/4th of the game and, yet, it is the hardest part of AI (!). This is the first moment when the alien is actively hunting you (not just lurking in the shafts), you have very few tools at your disposal, no flamethrower and limited knowledge as to how effectively move around and avoid the alien. Moreover, the objective does not pinpoint you to a specific location and forces you to explore rooms. The game itself not only barely provides you with that knowledge, it actively misinforms you! For example, the damn loading screens have the audacity to suggest that crouch walking is the best method of moving around when, in reality, one should use it only when an enemy is nearby (as in very, very close). Crouch walking is way, way too slow to make any significant progress and will force you to hide every 10 friggin' seconds. Walk, people, walk! 
The next time the alien will be hunting you, you will have many more molotovs, noisemakers, the flamethrower and the exact location as to where to go next. Suffice to say, the game is much more enjoyable the second time through, though not many people will want to attempt a second playthrough and I don't blame them.

The alien himself can be a source of some really cheap deaths. There are these ventilation shafts where sometimes the alien will wait for you to walk under them in order to instantly kill you. They are signified by the ooze or spit or whatever drooling on the floor, making an audible splash noise and him hissing a bit. Easy to avoid, right? Now imagine deafening alarms going off, stuff exploding and flying everywhere, the vents being barely visible and it's not that easy now, is it? Sometimes the motherf*cker will literally jump out of the shaft on top of you, killing you, even though no spit or hissing were present. Hell, a few times I couldn't even hear him move around in the damn vents and he still did it. The last mission is particularly notorious for doing this, not counting the ridiculous other scripted cheap deaths and near death experiences (like the train one which occurs 3 times IN A ROW).

At this point the alien stops being terrifying and just becomes an obstacle that hinders your progress. Progress which will take a while, since the game can take an upwards of 20 hours to finish. Let me get this clear: survival horror games are usually rather short (6-8 hours). This is because they rarely have the gameplay variation to support longer playthroughs. AI has the gameplay variation of a 6 hour survival horror game which is stretched out to nearly 20 hours. There are 2 times before the actual ending, wherein the player is left to believe that they are at the last level... and then nope, several more hours to go.

AI is also a master of creating artifical tension through overly long animations e.g. saving, going in and out of computers, power rerouting boxes, opening doors by using tools etc. All of them take 2-3 seconds longer than they normally should. Saving is the most obvious, but this also becomes very noticeable with the power rerouting boxes, where it takes literally 2 seconds for Ripley to just simply move away from them after pressing the Back key. What's more, if you get attacked (not killed) while being ""in"" the rerouting box menu, you do not automatically leave it like in other games. You are stuck there, hammering the Back key and yelling ""just f*cking look away from it, you dumb bi*ch!"".

And the ending is one of the most unsatisfying and abrupt I've seen so far.

In the end I can recommend AI only to hardcore survival horror fans and equally hardcore Alien fans and even then, read guides as to how to play the game beforehand as to avoid needless frustration.

And remember...

From the beautifully designed environments and attention to detail, to the stylistic choices and the feeling of authenticity to the original films. On top of that it's a genuinely scary experience a lot of the time, but unfortunately that comes at the cost of some pretty questionable game design.

For one thing, the scary parts of the game are mostly when nothing is happening. The claustrophobic tension of the environments is only made more unsettling by the fantastic sound design, which makes you feel like you're constantly being hunted, even when you probably aren't. The thing is though, that when you actually see the alien, it isn't that scary. Especially when it glitches out weirdly or clips through things. But even when it's just stomping around the corridors stalking you, if you're actually looking at it, it looks kind of lame and a bit silly. 

The strength of good horror games or movies is in how little you actually [b]see[/b] the monster. It's the idea of it that is frightening. A glimpse of an unnatural claw here... a close call with an evil looking tail there. The fear of the unknown. But when you spend 15 minutes out of every hour hiding under tables while the monster casually stomps around corridors, lit up by ceiling lights, it starts to become less of a terror and more of a nuisance. I started to wish the alien would go away so I could go back to being scared of it.

Which leads me on to the next issue: the much-lauded AI. The selling point here is that the Alien isn't just dumbly walking around set paths, or appearing at scripted moments. It displays random behaviour, which is supposed to make it unpredictable. It also apparently learns from you, which means that if you keep doing the same things, like hiding in vents, it will start looking for you in those places. All that sounds like fun, except that what it really translates to is an alien that seems to have no idea what it's doing half the time, and the other half of the time is able to seek you out as if you were standing in the middle of the room with a spotlight on you and an air horn.

Most of the time it seems like the alien just randomly runs around the place, and pops out of a ceiling vent every now and then for a wander around the corridors. I've crouched in a corner before and watched it walk right by me, and then two minutes later it's walked into a room and ripped the door off a locker that it had no way of knowing I was in, and ripped my face off. Whether it's learning or smart, or whatever it's claiming to be, or something else, it never really feels like it's stalking you. It mostly feels like it's just doing random stuff until it gets lucky and catches you out. Combine this with the save system that requires you to only save at sparse checkpoints, and you could easily spend 20 minutes sneaking your way through a zone, only for the alien to randomly catch you, and then you have to do the whole section again. The gameplay is trial and error, and there's not really any way to learn from that trial and error, because the next time you try the same thing, something different will happen.

In my mind, to be rewarding, a game has to at some point make you feel like you can triumph over the odds. You should be able to outwit, or outgun, or outrun the enemy. Or if you can't, you should be progressing towards a point when you can, through upgrades or gaining more firepower. None of those things are possible in this game. 

You can't hide from the alien. It will find you if you stay still, and if you move. It will find you in a vent, or a locker, or under a table. It will find you if you're quiet or if you're loud. Just a bit quicker if you're loud.

You can't kill the alien. It laughs at bullets and the only thing that does any damage to it, the flamethrower, really only annoys it enough that it will run away for a while. 

You can't run away from the alien. It can run faster than you, and even trying to run will make it more aggressive and more likely to find you, even if you hide after running.

You're not progressing in any meaningful way that gives you any more skills or tools to deal with the alien. The best you get is something that annoys it for thirty seconds. You can't get any stealthier, stronger or faster or gain any items that hinder the alien or protect you.

In point of fact you barely even get anything that helps you to deal with non-alien enemies any better. Pretty much all the solutions to killing androids or humans are loud, which means you just attract even more attention from the already annoying alien. I assume this means that the developers wanted you to use stealth as much as possible, except that stealth is meaningless when you can be found while stealthed.

All of this is a problem, because the game feels like it would be great fun if I could play it. Instead I spend most of the time sitting still in a vent looking at the motion tracker, wondering when I can move again, and maybe advance the story a bit or actually interact with the environment. I've heard the story is fantastic, but I can't bring myself to really bother with the waiting simulator that I have to play in order to make that story happen. Maybe they'll turn it into a movie."

I think the ship you start on and the creepy introductory sequence (minus a couple of obnoxious jumpscares that they couldn't resist throwing in) are very faithfully crafted and do a nice job setting up and ramping up the atmosphere. Unfortunately, once I'd evaded the alien and reached the first large room full of armed, crackshot survivors and miserly with cover, this pleasant experience ground to a halt. From this point onward, it was Groundhog Day. I died, reloaded from the last save station, progressed back to the room I was killed in - oh yes, there was a corpse run - and repeated the process around seven times before I finally lost my patience and decided to write this review. Whether I was detected seemed to be down to blind (and deaf) luck; I had little idea where these turds were until I looked out of a vent or from behind cover and was immediately seen. From inside a vent, I could hear all sorts of irrelevant ambient noise from the bowels of the space station, but not the people wandering around the adjacent corridor. This is not good stealth design; it's frustrating, and it's badly compounded by a save system that sounded like a tense, exciting idea at first but quickly became another stick with which to beat this utter b-stard of a game. 

I started off the game on the hard difficulty, because this was ""the way it's meant to be played"" - I don't know if that's the exact line from the game's menu, but it's what I seem to recall hearing from everyone who wouldn't shut up about this game when it released. After dying about twice, I went down a difficulty, then another, then another after that, with no change in result. Some people might consider it petty that I'm prepared to dismiss the entire game for that early experience, but based on the reasonable assumption that there were more of them to come and they'd become progressively more challenging (annoying), I decided I wouldn't wish this game on anybody."

And what's more and more absurd that the Alien that will kill you on sight can even catch you in closets and vents even if it didn't see you entering them!

All of this aspects of shitty crappy design can be tolerated at the end, but no, the idiots who developed this game thought that it would be very fun to combine cheap enemies with the absence of auto save and even manual save systems, in this game you can only save when you reach a telephone and they are extremely rare.

1236,3,0.5739,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This game has got to be one of the BIGGEST disappointments I have ever felt with a video game.  Ever.

A bit of background: I love the Alien franchise.  I love the intense, sci-fi horror of the first film.  I loved the action and expanded lore of the second film.  And I even love the campy 90’s/early 2000’s of the third and fourth films.  I know I may lose review credibility with this admission, but there it is.  All out there.  On the table.

With that being said, for the first four hours of this game, I was in heaven.  This was EVERYTHING I wanted from an Alien game.  The immersion was incredible.  The way that they perfectly recreated the 70’s futuristic look of everything, the music and tones they played—basically everything felt like I was in the original Alien film.  And I LOVED it!

One of the things I liked about the Alien film, was that you almost never saw the alien itself.  It was all based on tension, sounds, the long waits, the unknowns.  It was all a huge build up, and that was even scarier than when you actually saw the monster.  And the first four hours of this game played like this.  Besides the androids littered about (which I still found creepy and unsettling), you KNEW the alien was there.  You could hear it in the ducts, you could pick it up on your motion tracker, you could even just barely see it kill people.  This made for a huge fear of the unknown, and built that same tension that the movie had.

But much to my dismay, this is where the magic ended.  Soon afterward, the alien was in your view and hunting you 90% of the time.  There was no more unknown, there was no more tension, there was no more fear.  There was now just this big dumb alien walking around, and it just looked foolish.  The fear of the unknown quickly became the fear of making it to the next save point, so you didn’t have to slog through the same tedious hide and seek for another eternity.  Seriously, just watching it stomp around even created laughs sometimes, as this was so out of character from what I’ve seen in the movies.  No clever alien, no perfect predator, no stalking hunter—it was just a big dumb gorilla stomping around.  Magic gone.

Add on top of that that the alien inconsistently knew where you were.  If you ran into a room unseen and hid in a locker, you could flip a coin and 50% of the time the alien would walk right up to that exact locker and find you for no reason.  Or if you took an elevator up 20 flights or rode a tram 500 meters away, the alien would conveniently pop out of a vent right where you were.  That’s a dedicated alien.

The closest comparison I can make to this game is Outlast.  I was really surprised by Outlast, and I ended up really liking it.  One of the things I liked is how well it balanced the scary stress-fear with the creepy fear-of-the-unknown.  You’d be chased by a huge murdering lunatic for a bit, but once you left the area, it was back to creepy tension and horror.  Alien Isolation did NOT balance this way.  It was non-stop hide and seek.  Wait for a bit for the alien to walk by, scurry across the room.  Wait for the alien to stomp around, grab an item and walk back.  Remember that cool environment and sound I talked about?  Well there’s no more enjoying it, as you can’t stop to look at it.  Unless you count the back of a locker door as “environment.”

I’ll stop my rant there, but I just cannot recommend this game.  I truly hold this game as one of my biggest video game disappointments, and I hope this review helps any other Alien fan to stay away from this game.

It's bad enough trying not to laugh at the god awful player models and facial animations but the AI for the actual alien is so dumb. Its so irritating not seeing it move on the motion detector, having it out the entire time and you turn a corner and there it is charging you and not being detected. I love the alien franchise and the Xenomorph in general but this game makes it so hard to enjoy it. Atmosphere: yes. Cool sci-fi tools, scenery, and rooms: yes, logical AI for enemies: no. Actual effort put into character models: no. Amount of frustration from the alien just teleporting in the room next to you: extreme. honestly save your money for a game like Amnesia.

The mouse and keyboard controls are pretty bad and it seems you need to play with a controller. I was just not enjoying the game otherwise and will not be forcing myself to play the 18+ hour campaign. Maybe if it was more like 8 hours long I would have kept on going and maybe found some enjoyment. It definitely takes after the first movie more than the second movie, which is too bad, because now I want an aliens game that takes after the Aliens movie.

There was an AVP for the Atari jaguar a long time ago in a galaxy far far away that was perfect.

- On the PC version, the mouse movement is terrible... As is trying to scroll through the settings menus. This, and the linearity of the game, p!ssed me off the most.
- Ripley is an unrealistic, annoying, overly dramatic weakling, who constantly freaks out about everything, and who's voice does not match her in-game character's demeanor.

This has to be an excellent example of ""how not to create a horror game"" and ""a game that suffers from its own premise."" Yeah, I didn't even give this game 4 hours, and this is already how I feel about it.

To sum up, my experience with the game has been buggy, braindead AI killing me instantly without clear indications of why I am being killed or why the AI decides to glitch out preventing progress. AI with perfect aim, and bugging out to block paths completely. Next, a glitchy mess of a game that crashes on death and crashes on use of consoles. Ridiculous amount of animations and unclear reasoning behind the interactions with objects. Everything feels like a chore, whether opening a door or moving between locations. This game isn't even scary, or even tense. Level and environment design are nonsensical. Maybe playing a lot of horror games gears you up for what to expect, but immersion is constantly broken with everything this game does wrong, and its ridiculously predictable. Cheap horror thrills.

This game wants to be Bioshock in its explore-solve-gather-craft gameplay but is only a mockery of it. It wants to be Dead Space but doesn't even come close to the nitty-gritty horror and tense moments of animated interactive cutscenes. It wants to be Bioshock and give you an isolated city going to ruin because of the monster that you must explore. And on and on. There is no one thing this game does well on its own; it just badly borrows from other past successes.

Worst of all, I think this game suffers from its own premise; we've all seen the Alien movies, we know what this game is about, who the villian is, whats going to happen to the victims. Horror games benefit from mystery, from keeping the player in the dark in not knowing what their enemy is. It adds to the tension, as humans fear the unknown. In Alien Isolation, you already know the whole shibam, you're just living it in some random powerless protagonist's shoes in another derelict space station.

Worst still is that the Alien is allowed to pop in and out behind you or behind the quest door in many playthroughs, thus leading to a reload from a savepoint. Savepoints which are poorly spaced out . 

The scripted nature of things is very obvious when considering the size of the levels. Which if not considering multiple repeats due to cheap deaths, would take 5 minutes to complete.

Because nearly all encounter with the alien is fatal, there is no tension at all to this game. Any shred that is left in creeping around an encounter is lost by a dozen or so repeats in each gaming session."

I will say, it felt very much as if I was taking part in an Alien film - technology and general ambience is very 80s-esque, in the style of the original 1979 ""Alien"" film. This ends up being charming, and to the game's favour.

This would probably be worth your time at a discount, but not at the £30 price point it sits at the time of writing.

Revision: I still don't recommend the base game, for the reasons above, but there is a mod that you can download called Unpredictable Alien Mod that unshackles the alien's AI from constantly homing in on you, and gives it a far wider wandering range - this addresses many of the issues I had with the base game, and I strongly recommend it. I still suggest waiting for a discount."

After that the game just repeated itself; sitting in the closet/cabinet, dying because of trial and error and totally shi**y A.I.
Some people praise the A.I., but it's just basically alien knowing exactly where you are and circling that area. It does nothing but follow you everywhere, no matter how silent you are. It decides to check the room you are in 10 times without checking the other rooms on the other end of the corridor. After it leaves the room, it runs to the end of some corridor, turns 180 degrees and runs back to the area you're at. The A.I. literally has no sense of logic, and thus I call it shi**y. Some people claim that the alien movement is randomized, so it's great; sure, it is randomized, but it totally makes it illogical and terrible.

Gun fights are cancer. No enjoyment there. Killing androids is dull.

After the part, where people think ""okay this is it, the game finally ends"" (after overloading some stuff), the game continues with the same crap it's been for the last 6 hours. Hiding, and moving through the maps slowly af. With the alien. Again. I totally had enough at that point, when I checked how much is left. I was ~70% through. I just played 5 hours nonstop, and the last two hours I thought that I'm close to the end. Nope. 4-5hours more left. I really had enough of the slow-as-f*ck pace after 14 hours, so I decided to read the plot from wiki and watch the ending from youtube. Why? Because I know I didn't miss a damn thing that way. I'm glad I didn't waste those 4-5 hours on this game, because the ending sucked.

What else I hated? Bad execution of the game overall, repetitive music (in addition to everything else) and poor difficulty level design. Also, map design was forced and I didn't care for that either. The maps were repetitive too.
  Clichés, and foreseeable inconveniencies that is the game's plot's core. 95% of the missions was to ""Get there and restore power / bring sth online."" If I want anything restored related to this game it's my 14 hours of time.

The graphics were poor for a 2014 game. Antialiasing, devs?

If you like survival horror, don't play this. This game is way too long. It should've ended in 10 hours like Outlast. Outlast was alright. This isn't. This one will tire you so much.

If you like stealth games, this is one. Except, there are a lot better stealth games (Dishonored for example), that aren't boring as hell.

I have really enjoyed spy and sneaking around games, but much of this game is 'hide and seek' with Ai.  The maps themselves are poorly imagnined.  The vent ducts you can use only follow dev logic. It's a #* spaceship or port!  Air ducts you can crawl in should be as diverse as the corridors and rooms, but no, they are nothing but shot links from one room to another linking only one or two room per map area,  and follow no logical use, are too few,  just placed where devs want you to hide.

Scary? not a chance.  Everything is done as a animation you have no control over.  So if the alien catches you sneaking around or hiding, the animation kicks in and you watch yourself get killed.  IT's not scary.  What would be scary is if you got caught or found and you could still run or control you charaters, and would be killed no matter what.   Instead, the animation pulls you out of the moment and is like  a big annoucement, ""I've caught you watch yourself die.""   And because it is the same animation, you know exactly what to expect.  Caught facing it, push you down and jump on you.   catch from behind, poke through your chest.  

 I can't believe I'm about to say this next bit, because I love animations, but there are too many animations.  Sometimes you can have an animation, thirty seconds of walking, then another animation.  I would have rather had interactive gameplay instead of constantly pullling me out of the moment with a movie.

The damage logic doesn't make sense at all.  You have a revolver (looks like a .38).  And a jack/wrench.  Now you can kill a person with one shot, or hit them three or four times with a wrech.  Androids, on the other hand, can take 16 headshots with the pistol and it does nothing, but you can kill and android with 3-4 strikes of the wrench.  What?  How did they come up with a wrench that gets more powerful while the gun becomes useless.

The game controls just make me sad.  It's dev interactive ideology gone awry.  I believe in general you should have the ""use"" key do what you need to make something work.  For some reason, they felt creative key commands make it more real or interactive.  So to use a jack on a door, instead of the use key, you first his use key, then press both left and right mouse buttons at the same time, then press 'a'.  Does that feel more real to you?  The worst part it it is so complicated and non-sensical, they have to display all the commands on the screen so you know what to do.  Again, their idea of immersion pulls you out of the game.  Some hatches requre you to press 'use' then right mouse then 's'.  Why?  who knows.  Just let me press the use key, which I won't need isntructions for, and open the hatch.  If the alien sniffs at the locker you hide in, text comes up telling you to hold down right mouse button to hold your breath.  What?  it is suppose to make me feel more in the moment, but again telling me by text what I""m suppose to do pulls me more out of the moment that keeps me in it.  

How about the actual hiding.  This is where they were the laziest.  You can hide in lockers, cabinet, or under tables,  The same game assests everywhere.  Nothing creative or site specific.  When I was in a room filled with body bags, I should be able to hide in a body bag.  No, you got to find one of those lockers or cabinets.  And you can't jump or climb, (not part of your controls) so the entire gameplay experience is horizontal.    How about locking or disabling a door?  Nope.  Aparently, you can hack doors open, unlock hatches, and remove door jacks, but you can't do the reverse.  I would have loved if I could lock the alein in a room after tricking him to enter, even if only for a short time.  I could have come up with all kinds of strategy and gameplay options to get through.  they have so limited your options as a player, you aren't trying to figure out ways to hide or trick the alien, you are trying to figure out the path and tactics the dev want you use exactly use which consists of crawl, hide in locker/cabinet, let the ai passs, crawl, hide in locker/cabinet.

Finally, the last fail is the fear factor.  It's not hard for a game to make me jump.  I'm walking, a door flies off in front of me unexpectedly, i jump.  Here. you can predict where the alien will appear, and when.  They drop out of open ceiling holes which can be seen a mile away and the player cannot use.  Once they drop down, they partol the halls like any AI guard or security, doing rounds, coming if they hear a sound,  and sometimes stopping in odd places staring at nothing.  They don't use the vents you crawl in for some reason, and they follow you from one map location to another just because you are there even if they don't detect you.  It's all predictable.  It would have been so much scarier if they didn't alway just appear, or sometiems where there before you.  Or didn't crawl back up into the same vent they appeared from.  They were all constant reminders you weren't running from an alien, you were playing with an AI.

I think the initals of the actual  game say it all.  You are playing Alien Isolation, or AI.  Not scary, very redundant, always predictable."

1266,2,0.2855,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","WOW! Talk about  a 180... OK..since I have had time to really get into the game. I see where every negative review is coming from. In the last 10hrs of playing the game, I MAY have covered 30minutes of actual game time. This is due to the fact that you die.. A LOT.. A WHOLE FREAKING LOT!!  Its past the point of frustration and well into the realm of F this game.  The save feature, in the beginning, was fine..Like a new relationship when everyone is on their bestest behaviour.. but as you progress thru the game, you realize there are problems..major problems.  Like having to double back to original save points so you can save your progress. There are NO game checkpoints... it's manual save only or you start all over. For instance, I reached a cut scene during my ""escape medical department with the trauma kit mission"" where there was a huge explosion, there's  fire everywhere and your character, who was almost eatten, but was saved by the explosion,  is in a daze.. I'm trying to find the way out and of course, for the umteenth time, my character gets killed out of nowhere.. I thought Aliens didnt like fire so Im thinking WTF!! Ok, restart at the cut scene right... WRONG! I restarted WAAAAAY on the other side of the medical department.   That REEEAALLY sucks because I LIKED (past tense) this game.  Its got everything.. unfortunately, that ""everything"" includes an insane amount of backtracking, nonsensical enemy movement and NO checkpoints.. Speaking of enemy movement... Hiding in a locker, I spy the alien got out of the room and dart to the right. So I emerge and move left.. moving slowly and watching my 6...looking behind myself as i move backwards.. I hear that fatal screech as the alien kills my character from behind.. W! T! F! OVER!  In conclusion, after you reach your crew and have to find a medical kit to save one of them, this game takes a HUGE left turn into the abyss. There're way too many WTF moments, back tracking, no checkpoints and now it's  minus one more fan who really wanted to love it.  Changing my review to NOT recommended.. Not because I'm frustrated,  but because this game didnt have to do that!  It was fun, scary and challenging WITHOUT screwing it up.  


Original review with 6hrs game time:

A VERY NICELY DONE Sci-Fi thriller with survival crazed humans taking pot shots at you,  spooky androids with glowing eyes looking to snap your neck, while telling you to calm down, and oh yeah,  a big alien hell bent on giving you a full frontal labotomy! The characters are both creepy and a bit scary.  The atmosphere is just about near perfect! Not too dark, but just enough to give you the willies, and not too bright to make stealth movement feel like stealth.  The graphics on ultra look very nice and fluid from the sweat on the realistic character skins to the steam venting from various pipes. From the jet like fire from the damaged space station structures to the water gushing from coolant lines.. the atmosphere and ambience is nice and works very well!  There are save points along the way that are spaced out enough to require a bit of effort to make it to a save point, but not too far apart to make hard parts cumbersome and too repetative. The story and voice acting are well done and make me want to learn more from the personal data terminals and tape recorders past the ""need to know"" info. I find that I am genuinely interested in how things progressed to the point that you find yourself trapped in it. You WILL jump.. if not from being spotted and shot to death by humans, or being apprehended and throttled by androids, or being dragged out of your hiding spot by the alien, then it will be for sheer joy at making a checkpoint unscathed.. Now you can unclentch your pooper and take a deep breath... You're just getting started!   

There are light puzzles. The main part is figuring out what to do for them.  The text tips between checkpoints  flashes pretty fast, so unless you're a speed reader,  you probably wont catch it all. For each puzzle there are control instructions that gives a bit of a hint on how to solve them.   So far, they're not hard at all. After a fail or two, the sequence of events becomes more clear. I like that some of the puzzles I got right off while others I had to think about a little bit before having that ""AHA!"" moment.  

You pick up things and craft bigger things from them with recipes/blueprints that you find along the way.. like a med kit..WHICH YOU WILL NEED, a flash bang and a few other goodies that I havent used yet. The crafting is pretty straight forward. You pull up your crafting guide where you assign needed elements for the object and then craft it.  You have a limited inventory so crafting things early, when you have the blueprint, is key to picking up more stuff along the way.

Combat so far has consisted of only beating the brains out of a few trigger happy humans with a very large wrench called a ""maintenance jack"".  They drop some pretty hefty revolvers in death but you can't pick them up.  You have to find a revolver just for you that you can carry. Although I'm not sure what good it is.. The alien is oblivious to it and two androids on two occassions took a full cylinder to the head and neck, pumped out a white substance and proceded to twist the head of my character around backwards...bone cracks and all..LOL.. it was awesome! 

I thought I would check this title out and take a quick look at it.. LOL... That ""quick look"" turned into a 6hrs stretch of some really fun and engaging game play that I can hardly wait to get back to!

EDIT:i have finished the game in 21 hours and i ve got more to tell.

 This game is shit.I am sick and bored of pressing bottons, restarting generators, doing computer stuffs.
THIS GAME IS 21 HOURS LONG WALKING AND PRESSING BUTTON SIMULATOR.

ENDING IS THE WORST THING HAPPENED TO ME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

AVOID BUYING THIS GAME . IT DESERVES THE EXACT IGN POINT.

RIPLEY DO THAT RIPLEY DO THIS RIPLEY GO OVER THERE. SAME THINGS SAME PLACES OVER OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THERE IS A POOR STORY GOING ON WHICH YOU READ FROM COMPUTERS. GOOD JOB CA. NOW GO BACK TO DEVOLOPING STRADEGY GAMES PLS.

 BACKTRACKING ISREAL.

 Here are the issues:
 
1)Save system is kinda old.
There is no auto-save. You have to do it yourself with the boxes that are placed around.It is not a huge problem but Enemy AI and optimization not that great.Your game can crash really easly.Like Alien Isolation has stopped working.So you have to collect all the things, walk all the corridors again once you get killed by Bug/accident or game crashes.

2)AI is seriously bad, really bad that you wanna puke.
Especially Human ai is so bad.You just hide behind a box.They see you hiding they dont care.They just shoot at walls, eachothers or corpses that  are lying on the ground.Enemy just walk into you and you can kill em one by one.Once i had 5 human enemies with guns and me without gun.I just showed myself and hid behind something they came  to me like zombies and  peek and hit peek and hit.5 of them were dead.

Alien AI is rather good compering to humans but it is really scripted.Not like devolopers told us.

I liked  the Alien parts in this game but after 10 times death on hard diffuculty or game crashes (i got 4 crashes and one blue screen.LITERALLY WINDOWS CRASHED. I am getting 300-500 fps btw.Not bec of specs.) And The save mechanisim put you back to 10- 15 mins ago.It gets old and boring.
And also there are retarded parts like alien catches you all the time, if you go under the ceiling vent etc. Even you go full stealth you just cant predict that what fucking ai does.THE WORST THING IS on hard mod it is scripted.The alien AI just follows you.It is not clever or something it does just know where you are but pretends like it is searching for you.

3) character animations are odd.I dont know it feels unfinished.Kinda buggy.Game itself feels buggy.

4) Crafting system is rubish.UI is just bad.Everything you do is pain in the ass.You get flare,medkit in hand and you cant put it back.You have to use it or throw it.It is really annoying.As i said reading story from computers, crafting things and sometimes you find mini computers and u do power things which me and youtubers i watch dont understand, just painful.Simply because UI is really bad.

5) There is no story telling, you have to read mails and listen tapes to understand fully(I HATE IT maybe you love it)

1279,1,0.516,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I sort of struggled with recommending this game, but ultimately I had to say ""NO"". 

I liked the graphics a lot for a game this old (I have owned it for a very long time), the sounds were also amazing.
It did seem fresh the first 6 hours or so, but...

The Alien AI pisses me off so much. I literally had to sit in a locker for 30 minutes, becuase I couldn't move around due to the alien being on non-stop patrol. I would move from room to room, hiding, the alien would come in, smell around, and then run around some more. It literally wouldn't leave me the F alone, so I ended up setting the game on the easiest setting.

The movement really really sucks. You literally have to crouch walk around the entire game with your tracking device out so that the alien doesn't creep up on you. The first 1/3 of the game you could pretty much run around every where, becuase the alien was no where to be found, but as you make it through the game the alien is ALWAYS around. 

My last 8-10 hours I just wanted to finish the game tbh. I didn't want to waste any more time snailing around the map, covering the same ground that I had covered several times, rebooting this, opening that, collecting that, etc. The game was highly repeptitive, and got to the point of boring. You are on high alert at all times, but jeez.

The game is super lonely. I usually don't stray from online competitive gaming very often (last single player game that I played /  beat was the Witcher 3), but running around alone all of the time really started to wear me out. I wish that I had a homie to interact with. Ik, ik Ripley solo'd in the movie, but I just want a buddy....

Having to wait to save again is stupid. That is one thing that I didn't like that all that much.  I think that you're only able to save your game every 3-5 minutes or so. No that I like to spam save, but I really detest having to do the same objective  twice due to trying to sprint around to hurry the game along. 

You can surely buy it, its not a bad game; I just wouldn't recommend anyone purchasing it unless it was on sale. The visuals were really nice, and it was pretty easy to figure out what you need to do in the game. I dunno. I wish that there were some cool space games with these graphics though."

1297,1,0.6814,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","So about three hours into the game and I noticed something.
The game's titular enemy, the alien, is the worst aspect of the game, at least so far.
It takes 2 hours to show up and when it does it's atmosphere is destroyed.
Until then, I had been fighting enemies with guns, well avoiding them that is.
That was fun, as I knew where they were and it was mostly my fault for being spotted or losing.
The alien is the opposite.
I don't think I've had one death where I genuinely was at fault.
The first time the alien saw me in a closet, I didn't know the button prompts, and couldn't react in the time it gives you, since the game expects you to know about it beforehand.
Then there were the many deaths where the Alien corners me somewhere I can't hide, like in an office where he just sprints up to the door and acts like a natural patrol route.
The AI for the alien is also ridiculous.
It knows what section of the area I'm in, and makes it abundantly clear as it decides it has to hang around 10-15 feet from me at all times. I also can't move because if I can see it, it can see me and I'm already dead.
It has such hightened senses yet prances around me like it definitely does not know that I am under the desk, but it won't give up because its ESP has told it that I'm in the area.
It's as though it's on a trigger to occasionally run right next to where I am to make sure I regularly hide.
The motion detector is annoying too, since it basically turns the game from hiding out of sight of a clever alien murderer, and more like hiding from a pacman ghost, making sure I'm not around when the dot on the screen is.
It's genuinely not fun to play, and the way the alien will fly accross the sections through vents is ridiculous.
I'd believe it weren't just floating from one vent entrance to another if it weren't for the fact that it always travels in a straight line.
Interestingly enough, the game would work so much better without the alien, and therefore it is no surprise that shortly after the game came out, I stopped hearing about it. As though so many people wanted to believe that a truely good Alien game was finally here, when in reality it was just a dissapointment."

I cannot, however, recommend Isolation for two main reasons. I will list what the game does right, then what it does wrong, in my subjective opinion:

Pros:
Amazing atmosphere, well researched and well acted.
You feel vulnerable all the time, there is no safety net.
The graphics are attractive and they work well with the setting, and the various props around the space station are marvelous.

Cons:
The hostile AI, specifically the titular alien, can be downright awful. It will catch you when you least expect it. This may seem like a cool feature, but it usually means that crawling in to the wrong ventilation shaft will kill you because the alien got stuck there. Or it spends 10 minutes camping a door, forcing you to wait nearby. It only gets worse as the difficulty goes up.
Weapons are largely useless. Xenomorphs can and are hurt by regular ballistic firearms in the lore. They bleed acid. You cannot hurt the alien in Isolation with anything but the flamethrower (which only scares it off), and it does not even bleed acid.
I ran into game breaking bugs, where I had to restart three or four times, in the first 10 minutes of the game. Not sure if they ever resolved those.
I had to stop playing because my saves got corrupted and I couldn't load the game."
1304,1,0.4637,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Is Alien: Isolation a [i]bad[/i] game? [b]No[/b]. But is it a [i]good[/i] game? Not quite, and that's the problem.

Alien: Isolation starts off [b][i]strong[/i][/b]. 

The atmosphere is awesome. The corridors, tech, etc. are true to the original movies, which I love. You slowly uncover background details as you find discover voice and text logs. You can ignore these if you like, but most are pretty well done, and paint a grim picture of tensions rising as civil order breaks down on the space station.

The whole vibe is foreboding, and opressive, making you want to crawl around and hide even when you've yet to run into any enemies. The reveal of the Alien is impressive, and its presence is absolutely terrifying the first few times you experience it.

However, the game soon devolves into endless fetch quests, predictible jump scares, frustrating hide and seek marathons, and unskippable cinematics. Oh, and bugs. There's game breaking bugs.

Here's the pattern: someone is hurt, and you need to find some medical supplies. Or perhaps a plan to get rid of the Alien requires a certain component from whichever part of the space station. Naturally, you're volun-told to go get it. Your allies are useless, and never accompany you, although they'll talk your ear off. The missions will start off easy enough. You'll sneak into an area, absolutely paranoid about threats lurking behind every corner. There won't be any, so you begin to relax, as you hunt down all the collectibles and supplies. 

As soon as you reach your objective, a trigger will summon every God damn enemy on the map to your exact bloody location, and you will spend the next hour trying to sneak out of that same area, all the while dodging aliens who know exactly where the heck you are. 

The good news is that the enemy AI is incredibly stupid, and you'll hide from your foes pretty easily. The bad news is that sometimes they will refuse to walk away, because the AI knows that you're in the area, and you'll be stuck in your hiding spot indefinitely.

Even though you posses some pretty powerful weapons, nothing can even scratch these things, which is pretty silly. A shotgun blast to the face will do nothing except piss the aliens off. Getting noticed is essentially a death sentence, as they're faster than you, and immortal. The synths [i]can[/i] be killed, but it takes a pretty insane amount of resources (read ammo) to take them down. And there's versions of them that are a huge pain to defeat. 

Soon enough it will become painfully obvious where the triggers are located which will bring the enemies running to your location. It will also become painfully obvious that the fetch quests are literally never ending. Dodging aliens and shooting synths in the face will become second nature, and you'll long for flamer fuel not so that you have a backup in case you're noticed by the alien, but because you feel an overwhelming need to be able to get from point A to point B at faster than a crawl.

By the time I hit the ending of the game I was so bloody bored of playing hide and seak, and the story had become so predictible that I wanted to cry. Every time I was sent to the other end of the space station I knew exactly where the ""plot twists"" would happen. Out of which vents aliens would most likely pop out of the second I step through a door, or press a button.

I really think this game would have shone had they cut it shorter by about a third, and maybe added a couple of new mechanics. As it stands, however, it is a grind-fest of a hide and seek, fetch quest driven mess, and the bugs don't help.

Unfortunately, I didn't find the gameplay very fun, given that any failure on your part (or whim of the AI) almost always leads to death. Having an alien semi-randomly drop down nearby, somehow sense you're there (despite being out of sight and not making any noise) and murder you, causing you to lose whatever progress you've made since the last save station, is not sufficiently respectful of my time.

And the time you waited for the Alien to leave an area while hiding, only for him to still be lurking around, was absolutely irritating.

Also, many of the items had one or less uses for me in the entire game, which is rather stupid. Pipe bombs and molotovs had a couple uses; flares were helpful for only one portion of the game before the flashlight is equipped; I used one flashbang; and no noisemakers, smoke grenades, or EMP grenades. There also seems to be some kind of bug where you get stuck crouched, I noticed a few times.

This review isn't easy to choose yes or no for recommendation. I'm ultimately going with no on the basis of gameplay, since this is after all a video game. Overall, I will give the game a 6/10."
1316,3,0.6914,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","     I had heard a lot of good things about this game, so naturally when it went on sale for $10 I decided to try it out and see what the hype is about. So it was off to a great start; it set up characters well and the conflict starts early and explosively. The tension was at an all time high in the first few hours of this game, and the difficulty, while hard, felt kind of fair as you could learn from mistakes. And then as the game continued I realized there was not nearly enough gameplay to warrant the game's length. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be 'tedious'. I swear I have never seen a game with as many filler actions as this. Out of the 16 hours clocked I would not be surprised if 6 of those hours were spent flipping levers, saving the game, turning bolts to turn on power, waiting for people to walk away from the locker I'm hiding in, etc. etc. At one point I was just on my phone checking social media while holding down the 'W' key for about 15 minutes just to get through a certain space walk. I have never had a harder time finishing a game, I don't know where I found the patience to finish it, but the payoff was not worth it as the ending was pretty lame.
     It really is a shame because this game definitely had potential. It feels like the developers got some nice gameplay mechanics down, some decent story telling, and then realized they were not gonna meet a deadline so they just stuffed this game with as much fluff as they could in order to get the playtime that they wanted. I definitely would not recommend this game at full price, but if it's on sale, and you are a fan of Alien stories then you may enjoy it more than I did."

1- The Alien: after the second encounter with it I understood how it's coding worked and how it has nothing to do with it trying to find you, it's just leashed in a 35-ish meter radius around the player and it will wander around inside that perimeter until it finds you, there's nothing you can do to lose it since it's not actually 'trying' to find you

2- The 'other' bugs: This game is plagued, from flying guns to wall clipping, to enemies suddenly appearing right on top of you, hitting you once then disappearing from the game (they are still visible but they are no longer an interactible object in the game world, you walk through them and can't attack them, and they don't interact with anything or anyone anymore either)

In the short supplies situation, sneaking, hiding and runing is quite reasonable. When the game walks through about 60~70%, the same trick comes over and over again frequently, it is getting to start annoying and not reasonable. First, the atmosphere which has been created in the early game does not exist any more. Sneak is useless, the alien can always find you immediately, no matter you are sneaking, walking, or running. There is no different. Continuously waste the supplies, yes, waste. Scared back the alien at this moment, after about 30 seconds, it appears again and has already known your position event though the player does not move any step. The whole system is really annoying and player almost can not focus on the story line. I know the game designers want to make this game not too easy to get through. But hey!

- 1st half of the game ""Alien Isolation"" (around 6 to 9 hours in): Absolutely BRILLIANT game; high tension, slow build-up, stunning visuals and even better sound design. Sevastopol is terrifying at times and, during this first half of the title, Alien Isolation is some of the most frightening and intense horror you could ever find. The pros heavily outweight the cons in every regard.

-2nd half of the game ""Synthetic Isolation"" (past the 9-hour mark): Terrible pseudo-stealth/horror hybrid that fails miserably at trying to convey any kind of tension, fear or emotion from the player. You'll be walking and sneaking through DREADFUL corridors full of Synthetics that will just take ridiculous amounts of bullets to the face for no reason whatsoever. Just to put into perspective, after seven hours following a major story event I have NOT seen ANY Xenomorph, not ONE, it's ALL been Synthetics. Every masterfully done aspect of the first half is completely absent in this one, reaching the point of being insulting to the player.

If you want to play this game, STOP just as the major story beat happens (you'll know which one it is, don't worry, it's the first big one and when the game SHOULD have ended) otherwise you will be in for a world of boredom and fetch-quests: Do this, but to do this, you'll have to do that, but to do that, you'll have to do that OTHER thing, which will require you to go to the other side of the station to active some OTHER thing that... gut-wrenching devolution to what started as a master-class on horror."

Repeat ad nauseum.

[b]Suspense and terror? More like tedium and irritation.[/b]

[list]
    [*]Save system = irritation. You save the game when you find a telephone to plug a card in to. But it might be 20 minutes of sneaking around since you last found one so if the alien gets you (which it does often) then you have to repeat those 20 minutes of sneaking around.
    [*]Map = irritation. The map of the base flickers and flashes like a 1950s TV. And it's useless - are those stairs going up or down? How do I get to the floor above? Irritating to the point I often wished someone would kill me - then the alien did and I had to start again, even more irritated than before.
    [*]Hacking doors = tedious. Either a kindergarten shape matching game, or a 1970s video arcade game to hit a fast moving target.
    [*]Gameplay = tedious. It's really just a game of sneak and hide through a labyrinth, forced to solve a series of contrived puzzles while being repeatedly killed by an invincible monster.

My experience:
- Be a fan of Alien franchise
- Go into the game for the story, fully expecting some horror game tropes
- Pick Novice difficulty (pfft, I'm mostly interested in the story, Novice should be easy enough, amiright?)
- Get rekt by the Alien over and over and over again
- Get pissed off by the horrible checkpoints-based saving system and very low amount of auto-saves
- Re-play 5-10-15 minutes sequences again and again because the next save is a bit far away
- Re-traverse the f**k out of Sevastopol
- [spoiler]Get rekt by the Alien and Facehuggers even more in last few chapters starting with Reactor[/spoiler]
- Abandon the game for big periods of time just to get back into it a bit later, after you forget a bit how horrible are those bad points
- Rinse and repeat
- Spend 26 hours in total to complete the game just for the sake of story, which would take at most half of that time (or even just 4-6 hours), if not for all those problematic points.

There is a difference between a hard game and a punishig one. This one felt to me more like the second type.
I can understand the reasoning behind making hard games, especially horror ones, but it was a bit too much for my taste, and
that's on the lowest difficulty setting.

But stealth games should be about giving the player tools for outsmarting the enemy. It should give you ample tools to not engage. But the stealth in this game is awful. Enemies are completely unpredictable when they will see you. The lighting makes no sense at all, sometimes large lamps don't even illuminate their immediate surrounding. This makes is hard to tell if it's actually affecting whether enemies notice you. The mechanics are not explained at all, for example I still don't know if shutting down the air purification actually helps you stay unnoticed, how much it affects it if it does, and how long it stays that way (because guess what, it comes back online by itself after a few short minutes). The gadgets are mostly useless, especially against the Alien, and you get far too few crafting components to actually use these items. And the Alien is annoying as hell. It is so fast and unpredictable that it's not fun at all to ""outsmart"" it. It's mostly just luck. And it also teleports as far as I can tell. And it makes no damn sense anyway. It can't tell that I'm a few feet away, ducking behind some boxes, but shomehow when I get away from it it knows exactly where I went and teleports in front of me (through the vents, I guess).

Is this a good game? I will be going over Alien isolation in a pro/ con style and end it with my conslusion.

Pro:
     The game has an amazing atmosphere from sound effects that put the player on edge as well as the dark blood stained rooms with body remains. Graphically the game looks spooky and that itself is unsettling and could be a great aspect to make a horror walking simulation.

      The alien model looks horrific. I say horrific in a good way, the sight of it is scary never the less the death scenes adds much more surprising when you die from the alien hiding in a vent above the player or sneak up from behind.

       The enemies AI is very well done. Enemies especially the alien can track the player with sound, so being quiet and using noise makers to distract enemies to move past them or allow time to do a quick puzzle. 

Con:
      The game is very repetitive in level structure. Normally the game runs like this, you have a goal you make it to or halfway to your goal and there is an objective in the way. Most of the time you have to detour to get an item or flip a switch or what ever. It feels very padding and you will quickly notice that as well as how lazy it is to use the same structure for every mission. Yes normally horror games have this in some way but it isnt the entire game. Normally it is a section that they do this so it doesnt feel nearly as repetitive.

       The games AI is too good at times. The enemies especially on the hardest difficulty if they see you, they will hover around your hiding spot and it will most of the time make your gameplay hit a dead stop. Rarely the enemies will leave the location where your at allowing progression to be made. This applies most of the time with both the alien and humans. For the most time the androids tend to go back to their scripted pathing after some time.

       The motion sensor is pretty buggy. When dealing with the alien many of times the motion sensor will not pick up the alien movement while it is out of any air vents allowing for many deaths. Sometimes the motion tracker is not accurate with the enemies actual location and when you see they have left the near area you leave your hiding spot to be greated with a death animation.

       The game handles both stealth and combat in the game. This is not bad but i say this in harder difficulties that the limited supplies really show how awful this design is. The game hardly gives any supplies to with stand combat but in the later parts of the game, combat is unavoidable which causes you as the player to question did they test this? It is one thing to make the game hard with 1 hit from anything kills you but giving very limited supplies and throwing them in a combat situation that can not be avoided makes for a very bad scenario. The most annoying part was going into the hive but first dealing with the four androids on straight path with no room for dodging. The only option was to fight the enemies.

        Interacting with everythhing provids a less than intertaining experience. The game has obsticles where the player must manually cut a hole in a door or hack a door. These are moments that for the cutting the door parts the player needs to cut along a set path to reveal a lever. Everything done in the game requires real time player interaction which adds more time to play time and gets really annoying cutting open doors or using a wrench to open up doors or whatever. It will be better off as cutscenes. The point for adding this is to add more immersion to the game but it just is not fun to do and gets old pretty fast.

Conclusion:
         The game is not very fun. There i said that. The game felt too dull and the horror came in the form of loss of progress than towards the enemies themselves. If this was a walking sim where we exlplored with a lingering threat that formed from our minds then that would be pretty good. It nails the atmosphere on the head. In short the game is a massive pass because of how dull it is and all the issues with the AI being super smart in much higher difficulties or how combat in later levels is unavoidable and on higher difficulties the game is very much unfair due to bad level design. Sometimes the direction is bad in the game leading to things being confusing as to what to interact or where is a keycard to progress."

It was encouraging but unfortunately, the ""encounter tutorial"" refuses to let me pass through. Evading 4 people in this game seems near impossible and after dozens and dozens of tries, I don't really want to sink more annoying time in it.

Tried a couple more times, one I got behind the back guy as quickly as possible and got lucky and reached the next room, I then heard them maybe wanting to follow me, the woman saying she wasn't getting there. Just to be sure I went and hide in some furniture. Bad idea: they saw me and killed me from the other room.

Another try, the black guy got stuck behind a furniture and would not move at all, preventing me from even having a chance to go through.

This game is an AI mess, utterly broken.

Quite a bad experience in my opinion. There are many more enjoyable (and better written) games in that genre, go check those ones.

Updated 2017/09/15:
Managed to pass that badly written mess and eventually got to the fifth mission where you are ""properly"" introduced to the Alien.

From a first opinion, it is indeed spooky and stressful to avoid the monster but there are a few, how to say it, quirks that makes it an awful gaming experience:
- Running is utterly useless, it'll detect you instantly
- Not running is dangerous, as the alien leisury's pace is like three times your walking speed not to speak of your crouching speed
- The only thing to do is hide and even then it's made terribly and uselessly hard and tiresome as you have to use simili-QTEs (that will fail the first couple of times as there are two and the helping text is too small and the time you have to react too short to manage to live those first few times, another overlook) once the Alien has its nose on you and it's not even trustful as Ripley will randomly cough and guess what? You have to redo it all again.

So as a second conclusion, I have to repeat that it's a bad stealth game, with a good ambiance, yes, stressful, yes, but broken in way too many pieces to be enjoyable, at least by me.

And it's a pity because it had potential, but I'm afraid I will soon forget about it.

2017/09/27 Third and last conclusion after finishing the game.
The last third of the game was the most annoying, bad A.I. and design shined in that part.
All I can add is this: A:I manages things and fail at others and unforrunately it fails more often than it doesn't. This is not really a survival horror it's more of a puzzle game but even then it's a puzzle with some random pieces that change each time you try to go forward on the puzzle and that is the most annoying thing ever.
All that remains is the ambiance, it really does feel like the Ridley Scott's Alien. Other than that, subpar mechanics, uninspired scenario, broken a.i. really do this game a disservice.
And that's a pity because, again, it had potential."

-Intense Atmosphere
-Great soundtracks
-Graphics are amazing

Con's:

-Very slow game to begin with, you won't pick up your first gun for some time
-The stealth in the game is questionable
-Finding the story quite boring, keep in mind this is coming from someone that's never watched the movie
-The first gun they give you has little to no affect on the first enemies you face
-The combat is a mess and glitchy eg. Got caught by a robot was spamming the key and it wouldn't release me
-No Autosave feature, I get it's a horror game but there should of been a choice in settings to enable/disable this. Many people will get turned off by this since you can only manual save at certain points."

The horror is very predictable and feels cheap most of the time. Alien: Isolation has been out for a while, yet there is still a bunch of bugs present, which is frustrating and also kills the creepy atmosphere (that the game so desperately wants to achieve).

The atmosphere is great and very close to the original film. The atmosphere alone may be worth the money, if you like the first movie. You can walk through space-stations that look and sound like the nostoromo and the alien dens.

But... the game mechanics cannot keep up with the overall visual design. 

Often, it is not clear where to go - except when you just follow the direction of your motion tracker. It's okay, but for a game that tries to have almost no user interface, this feels like cheating.

Most stealth games give you some ability to know how well you're hidden or how much noise you're making. A:I doesn't. You have to guess what viewing angle each enemy has and how good it's ears are. Running will attract the alien from the other end of the station. Walking can be heard for 100 meters.

In most stealth games, the enemies are on patrol. The alien isn't. It quite randomly appears from the vents walks a little bit around and then hopefully disappears into the vents, so you can sneak into the next hideout.

In most stealth games, the enemies are slow, unless alerted. The alien runs like insane throught the vents to drop down wherever it likes. This is already this way, if you didn't make a mistake, but when you sit silent in some closet sucking your thumb. 

In most stealth games, game mechanics are constant, or you get a clear cue when they change. In A:I you have to guess, what mode you're in. And then there are scripted sequences where none of the usual mechanics apply and you may die because you do something that has saved and will save your life for the rest of the game. 

The game doesn't seem to have a rising difficulty. So the game is quite hard in the beginning, where you face basically the same deadly opponents as in the late-game, but you have no experience or tools at that time. (For example, I spent some tries in the Lobby after getting the hacker-device, because I didn't follow the script.) Later on the game gets repetetive and easier. Sometimes even to the point of a walking simulator.

I liked the original Alien movie, because it was a horror movie, without supernatural opponents or everyone acting stupid and irrational (as seen  in Prometheus). In A:I there seem to be few rational people. And I never undestood, why I only had to sprint 30m to attract the alien, but other enemies are shouting and clattering merrily through the station without attracting the alien.

And: The end is meeh.

The fact that you hammered a guy and can kick his gun around on the ground means nothing. That's pretty dumb for a game that wants to be ""ambient"" and ""situationally"" scary, and it completely breaks immersion.

Pros Great graphics, stress inducing sound and music atmosphere.
Cons garbage AI, garbage tedius and repetative gameplay, game console control logic, indestrucable enemy.

Basically this game involves your first hour going wow this is cool, its like I am in a movie.  

Then the second hour cursing those stupid survivors who complain about not getting rescued.. then when you the rescuer come along they spend the entire time trying to kill you.   First time ive actually enjoyed murdering civilians in a game, they are that annoying. Then the load screen tell you off for it.

Third hour you spend either avoiding or gunning down really dumb robots - who the alien at this point ignores even if you spot him dribbling saliva on one out a vent.

Then you encounter an Alien.  For 10 minutes you think wow cool. You really feel scared, hunted and anxious.  Then the game loses all its shine.  It becomes - ""sneak in room, Hide in cupboard,  Wait for alien to walk in room 12 ****ing times, and circle around your position 10 ****ing more times then wander off for a moment..  then sneak into the next room.""
 Rince repeat hundreds of times. For every room on the floor.    Sometimes it sticks its face in your hiding spot and you have to right click and hold S.      Basically the AI at this point could be described as ""tie a bit of string to your hand,  tie other end to alien,  alien circles around at the end of the string""   

It has to be the dumbest AI ive ever encountered in a game.  Most reviewers hit the ""medical level"" and rage quit. I can understand why, it can take hours between save points - and the thing is basically tied to you at the end of an invisible rope. There is no sense of realism that there is an entire space station to hide in.  No it just spends the entire game 10 metres from you like a lost puppy you fed,  walking around in a circle even through bulkheads and different floors.  You can even lock a door and bam the moment you turn a corner it magically phases through.  The level of pure chance involved in moving between rooms destroys any sense of strategy too.   You could move flawlessly for 20 rooms then on the 21st the game will randomly decide the alien will check your cupboard.    At least outlast gets this right, it randomly choses a cupboard in the room to search.  In aliens it rarely makes any sense at all.

Alien AI:
1: Indestructable, you have bombs, tazers, guns, emps, crazy robots, and armed to the teeth civilians. None of them can even scratch the Alien
2: First few levels its basically ""on rails"" AI, moment you step on a certain spot in the level it moves across a hallway and vanishes. Cheap jump scare.
3: Next few levels its basically a ""timer"" if you take too long in a room it will play an insta kill animation on your character and you have to reload.
4: It waits for you to step on a ""hot spot"" in the level and then the alien begins its ""circle you on the end of a magic invisible 10 metre rope"" for the rest of the level and you spend 90% of the time in a cupboard waiting for the motion sensor to indicate its moved to the outer edge of its 10 metre orbit around you.

At this point just to make things interesting it will randomly stick its head in the cupboard you are hiding in, and force you to do a game console like combination of button presses, which will then randomly take away your health if the alien hangs around too long, and if you dont hold them down long enough to start dying the alien insta kills you.

And what the heck is with the cupboard doors making so much sound when you close them?  Screach BAM BANG.  its like a grenade going off.. and yet the alien 4 metres away has no idea you just hopped in?    Really ruins the atmosphere. They do the same thing in ""outlast"" although the gameplay seems more compelling in that game.

To be honest they should never have bothered with a PC port.  This is clearly designed for the mindless console masses.
At a guess 99% of the positive reviews are people getting hot over the pretty graphics.

I am really getting sick of games where 90% of the production effort is looking pretty, and no decent gameplay or story.

Take away the pretty sound and graphics and basically the gameplay of this game could be described as: 
""pacman but with cupboards to hide in instead of power pills; with the occaisional key to unlock a door to go to the next level""
That's literally how shallow the gameplay is in this game."

If I could give this game a rating based solely on the atmosphere, it would be 10/10. The art team deserves the awards for this game, and them alone. However, I can disregard some of the bugs, and the setbacks if you are feeling more lenient, especially considering it is a new IP for Creative Assembly, and would love if they were to either create a sequel in some way, OR use the engine to create another similar game, with great atmosphere as well. Taking everything into account, I would give the game a 6/10. If I were to disregard the bugs, and if you take the setbacks as more content, it could be an 8/10.

Pros:
Great Atmosphere, sound, etc.

Cool crafting system

Interesting items (although some, like the flashbang, and revolver are pretty bland and unused)

Love the Idea for a smart AI


Cons:
Alien is not free-roaming. At some parts sure, but he is left out of areas, and forced into some parts. Its pretty dumb when you see him over by a window, and then walk through to find him right in front of you because reasons.

Goalposting. This game would be spectacular..if it was 15hrs shorter. Its understandable that most people appreciate the extra length for more content, but sadly for most this is not the case, and people argue that ""ITS JUST CUZ UR NEW-GEN GAMUR B PATIENT GIT GUD"". I love stealth games, and being patient and tactical, but anyone who believes sitting in a locker for 30minutes(Yes, you read that right) is flat out wrong (that also falls under the other note, where it feels he isn't unpredictable, and is very obviously sitting in front of the locker because you are there).

The difficulty settings suck. If they made hard mode harder, and normal mode competent, it would be miles better. Easy mode, the alien is a nullfactor, but the bright side is that you find out the Xenomorph is actaully Ray Charles, so theres that. Normal mode is like when you were younger and your mother told you to quiet down because she had work in the morning. You can still walk around and do whatever the fuck you want, you just gotta keep it down a little. Hard mode is extremely easy at times, and then super tedious during others. I played mildly conservative and still by the end of the game had maxed out on items, and crafting materials. Which sucked because in the later half of the game they become less useful because half of them don't effect the Xenomorph, and the androids start wearing suits that make them immune to everything. 

Ending Fkin blows!! Not everyone may agree with this, and to some it may fit. BUT going through all the setbacks, all the ""OH this just so happened to convienently blow up right in front of your face-but not enough to kill you-so you need to do an alternative thing now"" [spoiler] Just for Ripley to fkin die anyways (and also, why does she need to longingly stare into the helmet every fucking time she puts it on? She took so much time, no wonder the alien was right above her WHICH another thing thats stupid, the shine of the helmet shows no alien, even when the saliva is dripping, and then when she looks up suddenly WAM! Hes there. [/spoiler] just feels like a big slap in the face.

BUGS:
I would give this game a yes if not for the bugs. Here is a list of what I encountered:

-Flamethrower sound bug; You will hear a rattling jug sound for no reason as if you had the flamethrower equipped, but you don't.

-Floating gun bug; a random gun from your arsenal will be floating around in the air away from you, and can be seen behind walls.

-Alien got moves; I could kinda give it a plus to see the alien moonwalking across the room backwards, so if thats your sort of thing by all means, count this one as that.

-Alien is actually nightwalker; the alien will be walking past the desk you are hidden under, then suddenly teleport right in front of your face (im practically french kissing his second mouth) prowling down, and murder you.

-Xenomorph.exe has stopped working; The Xeno will detect you (you will hear the audible screech) but he will continue walking past as if he didn't..and then WAM he teleports in front of you-like the last bug-but this time he will just stare you down, making the nosie that he detected you and is after you.

-Bullet time; The game will randomly crash, but more importantly there are times when if you aim and fire a gun (happened to me multiple times with the shotgun) it will just crash immediately, for no reason at all.

-Finger Pistol; If you aim with a weapon, and then use your scroll wheel to hotswap to another one, you will no longer see the gun, and instead just see her hands aiming/holding them. That, or this was put in on purpose, and Ripley simply transcended the need for weapons, and uses her hands for guns now."

I'm afraid this also is the only reason I can recommend playing Alien: Isolation, if you're feeling nostalgic over the first movie. Then get it on sale with a big nice discount. Otherwise move along.
The graphics, the optimisation and the ""movie feel"" are really fine. That's it, nothing more to see here.
The characters are bland, especially our protagonist Amanda Ripley. The story is meh, and develops really slow. There are way too much of these alien encounters slowing you down, and after all it just started to get on my nerves. Gimme some variety ffs, I'm fed up with crawling from room to room hiding from this abomination pushing buttons just to rinse and repeat in the other part of the station.
With ""the amazing Alien AI"" on hard and nightmare difficulty the game turns into RNG/reloading simulator, because levels are poorly designed, with too little space to maneuver, and the only option for you to pass by the alien is reloading time after time getting your lucky chance, trying to slip by unnoticed and praying your tactics work this time. Stealth is pretty much your only option, because resources and ammo are too scarce, and the alien is indestructible and omnipresent, able to teleport from vent to vent in the blink of an eye. I'm unable to collect the data from terminals, I cannot do a thorough search for resources all because of the alien always on my ass. It must have some sort of connection with Amanda, because in the room full of people hunting you it will get YOU first.

You always end up in the same place wherever you go, and the alien always seems to camp you even though there are humans that are loud as hell.

1374,3,0.4708,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Extremely disappointing. What has been regarded as one of the most fearsome horror games in recent memory ended up as an assortment of hallway walking and button pressing. 

Pros:
-Controls well
-Interesting characters
-Interesting story
-Excellent graphics and visuals
-A fairly intuitive crafting system
-Numerous allusions to the original movie, from items to achievement names to subtle character animations

Cons:
-Not scary. The atmosphere is meh, and the alien, while visually stunning, just doesn't bring much. It'll appear from a vent, stalk around a bit, then leave. It's not frightening, it's boring and tedious to hide continuously. ""But you have to play on Nightmare! Then it's really scary!"" I really doubt that. Maybe it would be harder to hide, sure, but that doesn't make it scarier, just more difficult. And multiple repeated deaths don't make the game any more tense or atmospheric, just annoying. It's also way to easy to make the alien run off whenever you need it to, especially once they hand you a flamethrower.

-Tedious gameplay. The game basically dilutes to ""walk around the station and push a bunch of buttons"". Sometimes the buttons are little minigames that are kinda neat, but most of it is either ""press A bunch"" or ""press these two keys in order to do the thing."" The levers and cranks feel pretty good to enact, but when they're basically 75% of the gameplay (the other 25% being hiding) it gets a little old. Speaking of getting old...

-It never ends. There's about 4 places where I thought the game should end, but didn't, and in fact carried on another 4 hours or so after the last one. One sequence in particular has you go down a long hall to a room to activate a keycard. Then you go back down the hall to flip a switch. Then you go back to the original room to turn on a generator, and then back down the hall again to go through the now open door. Also the entire time the alien is all up in your grill with no good place to hide, so getting down the hallway so many times is frustratingly difficult. You can be a little clever sometimes with distractions, but it's so much trial and error that it still isn't fun, besides all the backtracking. Then right after you reach your destination, the game is almost over, and you get ambushed and dragged back deeper into the station. You find your way back to the exact same place, only now you have to run a gauntlet of hard to hit, instant-kill facehuggers and more walking and button pressing to get there. It's not tense, it's not atmospheric, it's not scary, it's just irritating walking through the same area 10 times trying to find where that 4th facehugger came from so you can blast it before it kills you. The entire section is completely unnecessary, along with a few other sections with other unnecessary button pushing and walking. It's like they decided to make a longer game not with actual gameplay and story elements, but unnecessary padding.

Honestly, my distaste for this game comes mostly from the last few hours. It introduces the facehuggers, it causes more backtracking, it's full of the padded sections, you'll die way more often than you did before, a lot of it is just not needed. The first 10 or so hours, while still not all that scary, provide good gameplay, atmosphere, and an interesting story, and despite the simplicity is a lot of fun. The last 4-5 hours (depending on how much you die, which will be a lot) are what soiled it for me."

Was enjoyinging the game quite a bit until I got to the  psychiatric ward in the medical center; where the Alien would find me again, and again, and again...  No matter what I did, no matter where I hid the damn Alien would keep making lunch meat of my face.  Even checked out videos on-line to try and figure out what I was doing wrong didn't help.

After over 4 non-stop hours of not being able to progress out of the psychiatric ward without the Alien chowing down on my tender internal organs, I was beginning to feel like I'd need to be committed to a psychiatric ward myself.

If your into games with a lot of sneaking around and hiding then this is the game you want.  I'm not into games where I have to spend most of my time sneaking and hiding all the time so...

The last time I was just about to make it and boom. I really disliked the way they had very few save points. This agrevated the situation of having to replay over, and over and over and over the same levels. You couple that with the really hard Novice level and it just blows the mind.
I also didn't like the way you had to go way over on one side of a level to do the first piece of the quest. Then your next step would be to the far other side of the same level only to find out you had to then return to the original far side for the third piece of the quest. Rediculous!

1388,3,0.5261,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Alien Isolation is a great game, so why the thumbs down you may ask.

Well let me explain. The game has everything to set a nice setting for an alien game, like the atmosphere the grain filter and the nice colors that are used to give the game a natural look. This game is a hide and seek game like Outlast and Amnesia, those are great games and so is this one BUT in those games there was a mechanic used for the hide and seek sections which was kinda logical. So let me explain everything in details.

Controls 6/10
The Controls is can be unrisponsive at times especially when you need to act quickly for hiding or runing from the enemies. Ripley walks verry slow and running  doesnt help because she runs like a 80pluser. The controls could have been more fluid for beter manuvering and running.

Graphics 8/10
Played it on 4K and the graphics looks verry smooth. You can see almost no edges but then again its inside a space station where there is almost no vegitation or any other demanding structures, just walls and doors and afcourse the outer space which looks nice. Nothing too ground breaking but nice to look at.

Sound 8/10
Man the sound is great in this game, it gives you the chills and captures the feel of the movies. Great sound effects. Every moment there playes a sound that fits the scene perfectly.

Story 7/10
The story was kinda oke nothing special, just Ripley looking for records about the Nostromo and her mom, she encounters some aliens on the way. There are some tense moments that keep you on your seat but that happens like only 20% of the game. The story goes on and on and on that it will kinda tire you at the end of the game. They should have kept it short and tasty.

Gameplay 5/10
Oke this is the biggest let down of the game. If the gameplay sucks then in my book a game is done, nothing can save it, not graphics not story, nothing. Oke let me explain. You play as Ripley, at the begining of the game you wil learn to craft some bombs, medkits etc and wil find some new scematics which you will never use, the crafting is kinda useless. You wil have no need to use it because there is almost no situation that demands it apart from some medkits which wil help on some fights, so in general crafting is useless. Then comes the battle part, well, Ripley isnt known for her fighitng skils so the game expects that you just hide, run and do the objective and avoid all conflict. Its nice and all until you play this game on hard or higher. You will get frustrated to hell, game is not hard but is frustrating. Like i said, in Amnesia or Outlast there was some kind of mechanic for the hide and seek that made sense but here it doesnt, the Alien alsways knows where you are and i mean ALWAYS. You cant even hide from him, he just appears at random and makes it a chore to play hide and seek with him. If there was some kind of mechanic that made sense then oke it would have been superb, but in this game the mechanics makes no sense. You will later get a flamethrower to repel the Alien but even that will not help later in the game.

Verdict 6/10
This game could have been easly an 8 or even a 9 but the the stupid mechanis that was just thrown in the game without any explanation makes the game verry frustrating  and when a game becomes frustrating then its a bad sign. You would aks then why did you spend 60 hours on the game if you didnt like it? Well, verry simple, i did it for the achievement because achievements drive me crazy LOL. All in all if you dont mind dying like 500 times and are a die hard Alien fan then give it a try, else avoid..."
1389,3,0.3713,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","coming back my review (after actually playing it past when the alien appears) i can say my opinion has be mixed of this game. This is by far the most scary and atmospheric horror games i think ive played and i think its a nice change from games like outlast where you have the ability to sprint away from the monster. As this game differs in the fact it is far more methodical; if you're seen, you're dead and this adds so much to the game because the monster is ACTUALLY LETHAL. However i don't think i can recommend it as the game play has pissed me off, no end; playing has Ripley is like driving a bus - she is slow and clunky and i feel uncoordinated playing this game. I get it, this game is about planning and being methodical but my point when ripely stares at the hacking mini game, waiting it to shut down, all stuck in place. Or when Ripley's fat ass takes her like 7 minutes to climb into a vent or even when you have to old e  to enter a locker to hide. These actions take valuable seconds to long to accomplish and it can feel as though the game play is being force; a far cry from the snappy motions in outlast trials for example. 

I will reiterate, outlast and this are different games, but ripely inability to role with the punches and the tedious saving mechanics just is a nightmare in my opinion. Perhaps i need to play on an easier setting? No i don't think so - there is an amazing core to this game, the AI of the alien and the dynamic 'tactical' skill that can be implemented by the player is unmatched to this day. However with the negatives listed and the combined amount of bugs i have seen, my experience has be overly negative."

Apparently Amanda Ripley went to MIT because she seems to have been trained in the art of hitting people with a wrench. Her engineering degree has also enabled her to flip switches, pull levers, and push buttons. She must have attended some of the same classes as Gordon Freeman.

My first playthrough was on hard and I never used most of the gadgets that can be made. Barely needed to hide in lockers, vents, etc. AI in this game is pretty basic so hiding out in the open works just fine most of the time. The alien was more annoying than anything but the scripted events were nice.

People in the station apparently went nuts and started killing eachother left and right because the xenomorph was running around while others kept doing their jobs like nothing was happening which made for some headache inducing  ingame emails, audio logs, and overall story.

I think the game would have been better if it wasn't tied to the Alien franchise. The xenomorph in this game is an unstoppable killing machine in combat. A dozen shotgun blasts to the face at pointblank range does no damage which is just plain idiotic in the Alien universe. It also knows the general location of your character at all times but not specifically where it can be found. So it'll follow you from map to map and area to area but will walk right by you if you're hidden. It'll also keep passing by your hiding spot even if you never gave your presence away."
1407,1,0.66,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I bought the game for 3 reasons

1) Love the Aliens/Predator Universe
2) It was on sale 
3) Everyone ranting about how smart the AI is

The third reason is why I am writing the reveiw..... Its NOT that smart.

This is no less a pattern game then the old 70's classics like pac-man. I do not consider that smart at all. I do not really consider that to be learning AI either.

Plain and simple, the alien ALWAYS finds you. Does not really matter what you do. This is because the Alien is programmed to have you as a node in which it will always revolve around and under certain prompts move directly towards.

Once the Alien plops out of a vent near you for no explicable reason, then that Alien will ALWAYS wind up in a room with you, for no explicable reason. It may leave the room, but it will always return to where you are sooner or later. That time period depends on your decision

You duck into a room and hide. Within 10-30 seconds the Alien will be in that room. If you don't hide, you will die. You can empty the entire cylinder of your revolver point blank into its head. Its invincible. You can shoot it with a flame thrower, it will just walk off and then come back.

If you hide and stay there... the Alien just runs an infinite patrol around that area.

Flashing lights, sprinklers, sirens, radios.... doesn't matter, the second YOU make a noise then it knows its you and its coming straight for where you are.

For some reason your character can't open and close a locker quietly. If you have played Dead Rising, think Frank West door opening. If you are trying to evade some 6'+ black thing why on earth would you slam locker doors?

So the Alien isn't smart. It has to run a path around you at all times. And since you are too silly to open and close locker doors quietly you always alert the Alien that you are hiding in a room, more importantly that you just left your hiding spot, so come back

Your motion tracker lets you know the direction the Alien is moving towards or from. But it makes noise. Once again the alarm blaring that one could argue is the reason tha Alein shows up and the flashy red lights are fine. The second your little hand held tracker goes ""duh duh...duuh duuh....duuuuh duuuuh"" the Alein is on its way for om noms

Leave the area you were both in, unseen and unlock another area. Doesnt matter, Alien moves to that new area for no reason and begins orbitting you.

overide the locks with the emergency button? 15-25 seconds later the door unlocks itself....

Don't hide in a locker? Hide under a desk. You get more time before the Alien comes back in the same room that it searched without finding you and with no noise to prompt it to have ever returned to in the first place.

So no. I'm not giving the game props for making a smart AI. Its not smart and its not learning. Nor is it rewarding the player for figuring out how the Alien is moving on the fly. It doesn't reward you for simply figuring out a basic pattern either. Not really. Broad, not basic.

The Alien does not show predatory ability like great sense of smell, great eye sight or great hearing. After all it can walk past the locker I am in the first time within a few feet with no issue. It does not smell me under the desk it just walked by. 

The game will prompt you to lean back in the locker when the Alien passes closer by after the 3rd or 4th time it returns to a room when you use the same hiding spot. It may prompt you to hold RMB to hold your breath also. But if it could hear or smell so well, why didn't it catch me the first time? What magically gives me away the 3rd or 4th time it comes to the room within seconds of me leaving my hiding spot if I run back into the same spot? 

So its a simple pattern.

Try to hide outside of a locker. Try not to hide in the same spot twice. Wait for it to leave that area to increase its orbit around you and move a little more towards your objective and hide again. Rinse/Lather/Repeat

To me, its not smart. Its gimicky, lame, boring, stale and making something difficult the easy way. To me thats the part that ruins ANY game. 

If I figure out an effective way to use the skill set of my character or to exploit a lack of skill sets of your enemy, then so be it. Program other characters that have different skill sets that I have to overcome. DO NOT give me an enemy that breaks the boundaries of the physics of the universe for no reason at all.

Either this thing smells and hears well or it doesn't. Either I hid before it saw me and moved while it was out of line of sight or ear shot, or not. Either I evade effectively or I don't

 It isnt smart if it will ALWAYS be where you are within this ever increasing area. Its not smart if its bulletproof. Its not smart if its flame proof.

Working Joes that take 8 shots to the head or shrug off being hit with a wrench repeatedly are also kind of lame, but at least they are not one hit killers like the Alien. 

On sale with a bunch of the DLC's its ok for the other modes where the programming isn't as cheezy, but I wouldin't recommend at full price and I'd barely recommend it even on sale if you were looking for a true challenge and not a long and well drawn pattern game that doesn't reward you for being stealthy

TLDNR.....

The alien is not smart. Its programmed to never be far away from you and run a loop around you. You do not evade it completely. 

The game is simply hiding, waiting a few seconds for it to go as far away from you as it can before it loops back to where you are, then walking as far as you can before its path reaches you, at which point you need to hide in another area. Repeat this over and over again until you get to wherever you need to go

AI is not smart. It isn't learning anything, it simply initiates ""found you"" mode if you do not hide in different places or don't keep moving towards your objective at which time it kills you with one hit regardless of any type of physics or honest way it could have known you were there"

First, you should know before buying this is that, this game is survival horror game. You will do very little fight and you will spend all game mainly running around pushing switches. Everything is limited and you will always try to find a way to avoid fighting or die. 

While I do understand the concept of the game is survival horror, this game was very boring to me. Everything felt like I'm just watching Origional Alien movie except I get to move main character around. Very little exciting moments to get your heart beat moving at all.

  It also fails to bring in new threats, androids and aliens will be all you see, only their numbers will increase, some might get a reskin, but combat-wise there is no difference. You encounter more sturdy enemies and find more powerful weapons.
  
  The alien is terrifying, but after obtaining the flamethower rushing through a level is not a challenge while hiding is a lot slower and will only end up getting you killed. The story gets very boring in the end and the finale is disappointing.

I wanted to like Alien Isolation, but the game is just riddled with bad choices that shouldn’t have made it past the first Beta test let alone still be in the game more than two years after release.  Consequently the game is just tedious and frustrating.

-There are way too many items to use and the selection system is clunky, even worse accessing it doesn’t even slow down combat, so you end up awkwardly scrabbling around trying to select items while getting beaten to death by androids.
-The making items out of junk is cute, but in reality it just adds a tedious level of micromanaging.  We should just find these items readymade.
-The map doesn’t make it clear where there are entrances and exits.  The map objective icon also shows up on multiple levels, which does nothing but create confusion! 
-The Alien isn’t fun to play against.  It’s always around, a lot faster, finds you easily and kills you instantly.  Hiding in cupboards all of the time and sneaking throughout the entire game isn’t fun!  And there was nowhere the alien couldn’t get you, so when I saw the alien I didn’t panic knowing I’d have to run for my life, I just  resigned myself for another insta death and the tedium of replaying the level.
-The saving system is annoying.  Being forced to save at specific places is just irritating.  The game should just auto save periodically or once you reach objectives.  For me getting to the next save felt good simply because (on this level) I will never again have to repeat the tedious task of hiding in a box for ten minutes so I can gather all the bits of junk from the rooms (for the nth time!) before inexplicably receiving a insta-death."

1433,1,0.6498,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I stoped playing after 8 hours of gameplay. Sadly, I got bored too much. Having played several horror games, I truely admit that Alien: Isolations does quite few things right. I really liked the audio, and the lack of simple jumpscares really got me - at first.

A:I is, after the first 2 hrs, more or less a boring hide & seek play, where, of course, you hide. Having played on hard diffuculty, I found myself hiding in quite a lot different spots, listening to the aliens moves, staring at the blimbs (because it makes sounds - yeah .. ) of the movement sensor, guessing the future movement of the alien to sneak further. Sadly, it got me too often. The lack of saving opportunities lead me regulary into situations, where I had to repeat the same sneaky 10 minutes over and over again, just to get one room further. So I startet ""rushing"" through, knowing where the alien would eventually pop out, just to get to know where I should be heading. Now I am not scarred anymore - the game lost it's charme completely.

I agree with the comments about the Aliens AI. Sometimes, it spots you from far away, sometimes you can literally sneak over his tail and escape. I once found a door I could lock, I walked through, locked it, spotted the alien trough the seetrough-window - and it did't care nor waited the 5ish seconds untill auto-unlock nor set up trap on me. It just went away."

1437,1,0.6652,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I am right on the knife's edge about this game.

I wanted to love it.  Certainly there are a lot of things to love.  The theme, the score, the spookiness, the way it made me look up when walking down the hallway at work.  The fact that it was so absorbing that when my cell phone rang, I literally jumped.  Amanda Ripley was great.  She was the reason I kept playing.  I needed to know what happened to her.

The problem is the parts that I hated.  First, do NOT get this game unless you at least tolerate stealth games.  And if you only tolerate them it's a near thing.  I almost stopped playing in chapters 5, 6, 11, and 14.

Be prepared to spend tens of minutes cowering in closets while the alien literally walks around the perimeter of the room in front of you over and over again.  

You can only save at certain physical points, so be prepared to spend 20 minutes sneaking and closet hopping only to die in the last stretch where you have to cross open ground, over and over, even on the easiest setting.  I started on the normal setting, and moved it down as frustration overcame me.

Be prepared to be killed by the alien from behind when you've got your back into a corner, or when you can literally see it in front of you.

I like games where if I do things right, I can get through after maybe 3, 4, 5 tries.  This was not that game.   I am not great at stealth, but this was something else.  The alien would randomly kill me in closets even when I was holding down the two buttons for extra hiding.

It can smell you, it can hear you, it remembers, etc etc...

I couldn't wait to pit myself against this unusally intelligent, merciless beast.

Now, there IS an alien in the game, but the truth is that mostly what you will be doing is avoiding and navigating around these incredibly annoying androids.   The game is freightening at moments, which is great, but Alien: Isolation is much more about navigating these dumb androids:  avoiding, hiding, banging on their heads.. over and over and over again until they flop over.  They truly suck.
Combine this with a story that in my view requires a handful of stupid-pills to accept, that I guess I just have to recommend a pass on this one.  I really really wanted to like this game, but there just isn't that much 'alien' in it.

There are no given indications to how hidden you are and some of the methods to hide that you expect to work don't and the ones that shouldn't do much better. Basically, the alien is on a timer, when he's in the vents you can walk as fast as you can to an objective and when he's out you need to hide behind a box for several minutes as he never looks behind said box and leaves. Overall, the first few hours were great, but after felt like a slog fest through boring point A to point B quests to where felt safe to start ""step checking"" the Alien and brute forced my way through.

I'm not saying I'd advise against a sequel, just a jump feature or climbing? A survival situation dosen't seem like the time you'd be limited to a jogging pace.

Plus there's just a lot of waiting around and a lot of loading screens (I have an SSD so they were fast, but there's still lots of them). I would also like to comment on the heavily compressed, 30fps pre-recorded cut scenes, they are just horrible and laggy, whereas the main gameplay was super smooth at 60fps without a single drop on max settings, this is a common problem with console ports and cut scenes unfortunately.

The voice work, story and visuals were all good but the gameplay was just slow and boring and dragged on, plus there was one very length section that was frankly terrible, after Google'ng the area it's considered by most just an awful experience (not because it's hard, it's just long and dull), it was at this point I almost quit the game entirely.

1461,1,0.3704,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Starting off an atmospheric, terrifying game, Alien: Isolation [A:I] degenerates into a tedious balance of hiding simulation and lever-pulling monotony.

I took my time with A:I. My 22 hours isn't a single playthrough - having come away from the game in late 2014 and reapproaching it this month. However, the game is long. And for the first eight or so hours, that time flew by; the story was well paced, the charcters well developed, and the enemies progressively getting harder, smarter, and more interesting. Yet once all the mechanics had been introduced, and I was stockpiling every item in my back pocket to-the-max, the game began to trail off. Or, more accurately, it began to get repetitive.

In the later levels, Ripley, our playable character is left fending off the Alien and the 'Synthetics' with nought but a voice in her ear, and without the support of a story (beyond the ""I need you to go here and pull this lever so you can go there, next"" trope), there really wasn't anything to support the game beyond the frequent hiding in cabinets from your various persuers. Moreover, once you get ahold of the more powerful arsenal of tools, the Alien is, frankly, a bit of a joke. Even on the hardest difficulty, scraps were abundant enough that I never ran out of molotovs to launch at the thing! And after the fifthtieth time of being caught by the damned thing, the hole punched in your chest becomes a bore to see (pun not intended).

That is not to say A:I is a bad game. Its polished graphics, and art-style that stays beautifully true to the films is what got me through the latter half of the game. The big set-pieces are a serious marvel to behold, and the game sounds absolutely beautiful; with the clanking of the vents as the Alien crawls overhead to the chilling calmness of the Synths asking you if 'you'd like to test their safety protocols' as you watch them cave another mans' skull in. The game is certainly well made.

But, for me, it overstayed it's welcome. Once it has introduced itself, it just recycled its mechanics throughout, to the point that they become predictable. For instance (as a minor example), in the penultimate mission, you have to power up a generator so that you can take a lift to the Comms tower. But when you get to the lift, the power short-circuits when you press the button and you have to go all the way back trhough the maze of corridors to pull THE SAME LEVER again!

It is for this reason that I cannot reccomend the game. I enjoyed my time with A:I, certaintly, but the genius of the first few chapters is gradually lost in favor of jump-scares and cliche story tropes.

You will die many times and never feel like you stand a chance against any of the games enemies (including fellow humans).

All that said I do keep coming back to it slowly chipping away at the campaign. The graphics engine is very well optimized and it supports cloud save so you can just quit as soon as you get frustrated and come back down the road.

The player is typically ""railroaded"" through levels with only one or two paths to choose through levels. Some have only one path from beginning to end.

As for atmosphere, the suspense and terror quickly give way to frustration as time and again the player is killed by the alien (the main antagonist in the game) or other threats (such as androids), forcing a reload from the previous save point.

So, to summarize, if you  haven't yet purchased this game, I'd say sait until you can get it for around $20 or less. In my opinion, due to the limited replay value, it's not worh more than that."

-Sounds and music directly and enhanced from the first movie. Can't get any better in this aspect.

CONS:
-The original voice actress of the main protagonist sounds ridiculously amateur.
-This is one of the most boring and unnecessary long games I have ever played, mainly because you are doing the same thing all the time:
a) starting a generator/shottind down a generator
b) backtracking for second, third, fourth time and beyond
c) escaping and hiding from annoying robots and alien(s) that chases you with teleportation powers constantly, becoming annoying and predictable.
-It has one of the worst endings in a modern videogame. So little reward for so much repetitive boredom.

★OVERALL★
Alien: Isolation teaches us that you can't trust the majority's opinion. This game has been praised to high hell, but I found it severely disappointing. I thought I was buying a game about  Aliens, but what I got was a half-baked stealth/walking simulator. After just two hours, I couldn't take it anymore. It made me want to scream at the sheer amount of mediocrity assaulting my eyeballs. Don't buy it!

★STORY★
It's like they spent an afternoon developing the story for this game at a pizza hut. You're playing Ripley's estranged daughter. Your motivation is the promise of finding your mother that's been missing for years. That's about it. Yep. That's your motivation for risking your life on a broken ass space station with a psychotic monster on-board. Everyone is dead or dying or killing each other. Does this make you want to stop, turn around, and get the hell out of there? Nooope.

★GAMEPLAY★
Omg the gameplay is just the worst. Most of my time was spent wandering empty halls wonder where the fuck I was supposed to go, because the waypoint system is complete garbage. Most of the time, I was given an objective with no clue where to go or how to achieve it. I've never had to resort to Youtube guides within the first hour of a game before. Everything is so fucking dark that you can't see anything, even with the gamma turned up to max.

You can't jump and are often blocked by TINY BOXES, fallen pipes, or sealed doors that serve as a barrier to keep you from exploring too far, so there's literally NO exploration to this game. In one instance, instead of hopping over a knee-high barrier, you're forced to climb through a fallen vent that has collapsed onto said barrier to get past it. I mean, come on. That's just awful.

Once you pull out your flare, there's no way to put it back. If you accidently push the X button, oops! There goes your last flare. Too bad, so sad. Guess you'll have to use your flashlight that gobbles up batteries so fast it only lasts a few minutes.

★SOUND & MUSIC★
The production value of the music and sound effects are truly the only saving grace of this game. It's really top notch. But unfortunately, it's not enough to save the game.

★BUGS & BOTHERS★
It really bothers me that this game is being sold as a cutting-edge graphics engine that will knock your socks off. Well, that's a lie. The use of lens flare and really, really, REALLY dark gamma correction is used to cover up the flaws like a makeup on a cheap hooker. Once the cutscenes (of which are too frequent for my tastes) take over the screen, you get a good look at how bad the graphics really are."
1480,1,0.5088,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I spent 7 and a half hours in this game. The first hour was spent locked in the first mission because the door to the tutorial NPC was bugged shut. About 5 hours was spent asleep because I was so bored. About half an hour of wandering around rubbing my face on walls trying to progress by mashing E on anything that looked even remotely interactable. Then another hour in a room with a large group of people that would instantly spot me and instakill me with their revolvers no matter where I was or how stealthily I entered the room in the first place. Over all, I actually only wasted 2 and a half hours on this game, and that was 2 and a half hours too long.

Other things I didn't like: 
The first companion in the game is a prick and I wish he would have died sooner.
The first companion blocks you out of being able to interact with possibly the only sane humans on the station.
There is 0 non-combative interaction with other humans as far as I can tell. I don't know, I got bored really fast and didn't bother.
The movement is clunky as fuck, probably to make you feel ""spooped"" or something. 
Not at any point did I feel fear during this game.
90% of the game as far as I can tell is slamming your face into as many walls as possible to find things to interact with to progress the game.
It might as well be a metroid-vania with how much time you spend collecting useless items and backtracking. It's basically MacGuffin : The Game.
It's probably just because I paid 0 attention whatsoever, but I have no idea what the main character's endgame is. Why am I trying to get to these places other than theres only one way to go?
Human enemies have elite sniper accuracy, instant reflexes, infinite ammo, might as well be using AWPs with how much damage they do, and their guns are soulbound and unable to be picked up until the game decides to let you have a gun on its own time.
Alien showed up once in my time playing. It sprinted at me and killed me instantly. When I respawned, it didn't show up at all.

In general, it was a massive waste of time. If I didn't get it in a Humble Bundle, I would have refunded it after the first hour of sitting in the starting room."

This game does not do that.
There is ""OMGWTF"" which is apparently labeled, ""Novice"", ""Are You Kidding Me?"", AKA ""Easy"", Then ""Definitely not easy"", Also known as Medium, then Hard and Insane are probably extensions of just that.

Strangely, the least difficult of all three modes I tried was Normal.  I guess having a relaxed AI was nowhere in the cards for this game.

Perhaps something was just glitched for me, but the alien was out and wandering around at least 50% of the time.  I thought it would be nice to have a few breaks from it... you know?"

But all I do is think about it and what it could have been if the PC Industry hadn't turned into a bunch of cowardly retractors that didn't let go of what they were trying to do.

This game needed Ridley Scott during his Alien/Blade Runner days; That guy took on Warner Bros. head-on and kept them at bay until the Film was done they way he envisioned it no matter what the cost and what it took to achieve it.

Remembering something from 1982 or 1979 and persisting to this day in trashing every single film of its genre 3 decades later should be a poster every game developer should stick on their wall before they tread wearily into the Games Industry.

* In most stealth games you can pick up objects, and toss them to distract the enemy. In this game the hallways and rooms are littered with things like cans and little boxes you could toss. BUT In this game you actually need to craft a ""noise maker"" (if you even find the blueprints) which takes about 4 objects in the game. There are lots of physics objects but absolutely no way to interact with them.

* In most stealth games a Melee kill is silent if not seen by other humans. Not so in this game. Everything is loud as hell.

* Most games a headshot from a .357 magnum handgun is a lethal shot. NOPE not in this game, you wil need to shoot most humans atleast 2 times and robots from 7-10 (yeah they force you to run for cover to reload, to make a single kill)

* Alien can hear your motion tracker from across the map, but in some instances you can actually walk right next to it, kicking boxes and cans and it is completely oblivious to where you are.

* Most things you craft are completely worthless. Flash bang only works for an instant. Alien, androids and humands all see right through a smoke bomb smoke screen, and have pinpoint shooting accuracy. The stun baton only works long enough to half-way kill an android.

* In the movies a point blank shotgun blast kills aliens. This game the alien is invincible. Even a pipe bomb will only scare it away.

* Humans are flamable for some reason. They get even close to a molitove and they suddenly light ablaze as if they where covered in gasoliene. 

* Maps are all alike. There is  very little variation from hallway to hallway so getting lost is a constant thing. Reminds me of the early Quake games.

* Things in the very beginning of the game are inaccessable. Leaving you to think you missed something. I ended up looking up a hint guide to find a blowtorch in level one only to find out you do not get one until level 11. (After reading a lot of spoilers) This is just sheer lazynesss of the developer. They are re-cycleing maps rather than making new ones.

* The controls for certain things are simple, just hit the action button liike in most games. But some things require a combo of 2-4 buttons, for no real reason, other than to irritate you.

* You can miss things like door combinations and keycards very early in the game, making the game impassible in further levels. Backtracking is a constant thing. (lazy, lazy developers).

* Middle of the game you get to be some jerk prisioner to explain an earlier event. Not a bad idea, except you are walking REALLY slow. No way to run, in an uninteresting map. This walking simulator takes a lot of interaction to make the story advance, but you are only going in 1 direction, doing stupid little tasks like ""hold A to boost up a ledge"". This could have been a 20 second cutscene, but the developer decided you really need a hour long slow-walking simulator with 0 gameplay.

* your decicsions mean nothing in this world. Simply find the button, keycard, passcode, or device to advance to the next area.

* You character is un-likeable. The entire story revolves around some selfish little b!tch, who will stop at nothing to find out the fate of her mother. 

* Re use of human model makes this game seem like it is from 1998. OK you have met the ship doctor, no wait.... Later he has a new uniform, and he is the captain of the command... No wait.... later in the game he is one of the bad guys in a different uniform. WOW!! there are about 20 of this same guy through the game. Same head model and voice actor. 

* Hey! you an control the lights!!! this should make stealth easier right? NOPE, alien is either right on you, or standing right next to you like it just smoked some weed, and is lost looking for TACO BELL.. Humans see just as far, and are dead shots with their little handguns. Robots from some reason are the only thing effected by the lights.

* You need a physical journal for this game like it was 1980 or something. You have to log down keycodes and combinations that you may not use for 3 or 4 levels."

The game looks great, and it has a great atmosphere, but the controls and the stealth are so utterly broken that its nearly unplayable. The human AI is so poor that they will stare right at you as if you don't exist, while the alien will somehow teleport across entire levels in a split second to instagib you. There is no way to battle the alien, to stun it, or to cause it to at least retreat temporarily from you.

The production quality of the game is amazing. The atmospehere, the design and the amount of work the studio gave to re-create this 80th retro-scifi vibe deserves nothing but the prise. Everything starting from the environment props to the save point system, old teminals, vice acting, music and sound is perfect.

But does great production quality result is great game?

Not necessery. This game is a mix of a spaceship exploration and a horror. But it fails short in both categories. It does not work well as metroidvania exploration, because it is too linear and force you to strictly follow the established route. It has good crafting system, but never really utilize it beyoun the mere gameplay gimmick. 

As a horror it is great for a first half until you unerstand how tedious and predictable are alien encounters. This game is a best when there are actually no monsters in a screen.

I would say SOMA does everything that alien tries to do and it does it much, much better both from the point of the gameplay, game design, story and horror elements. Aliens Isolation is just... meh."

The game makes you wait and makes you wait even more, and even more.
Multiple times the game has thrown you around, so much you just want it to end. And when you get close, kiss it goodbye when it throws you into another place and completely upsets the crap out of you.
It has good elements and teaches you how to use them, somewhat after killing you 20 times, and then when you finally master it, it tears it away from you, making you wonder why you even spent the time learning it.

How would you like to spend hours walking slower than a toddler though nearly unlit corridors with limited use of a torch and contrived plot points? You wouldn't? Well, no one told these developers that.

In addition to the above stated, the stealth (you know - what this game is all about) is nearly impossible since you can't see or hear your enemies (people at this point) and when you do, they do to... and they have big ass guns... and you run away only running away is about the same speed as walking.

So when you're not busy slogging away from bullets or completing the most random QTE's the gaming industry has ever seen, you'll be walking... and walking... and walking.

There isn't even any mission tracking so you wont even know if you are walking the right way or not - you'll just be walking until the universe presents you with your objective. Or you rage quit (like I did).

- The graphics is nice. But the graphics is nice in tons of better games too.
- The sound is fine until it comes to trying to figure out where your foe is based on their footsteps (hint: it can't be done).
- Checkpoint based saving is painful. Always.
- User Interface induces violent tendencies with its terrible key bindings (no mouse support in menu btw). Another effect of bad porting.

If you are not familier with Penumbra it and A:I are survival horror type of games. Instead of getting a BFG and blowing your way through levels with sawed off shotguns packed with double aught buck you tip toe around a space station while not trying to get stabbed or shot in the back.

1498,0,0.5135,"bug, work, crash, fix, review, buy, issue, break, try, problem","I bought this game once already on the PS4, but it was plagued with frame rate issues, particularly during cutscenes.  I found this to be incredibly annoying and immersionp ruining, so I stopped playing it only after an hour or so.  

I recently bought the game again on PC during the Steam Winter Sale in the hopes of better performance.  Obviously, due to the massively better specs of my PC and laptop over my PS4 (i7 3770k and i76700HQ respectively, both with GTX 1070s and >16GB RAM running on Windows 10) the game looks gorgeous and runs at a stable 60FPS at 1080p. 

The reason I cannot recommend this game is that even after two full years of massive performance issues on the PC related to crashes, the developer has not yet been able to fix the issue.  Many of the fixes for this game involve editing Steam files, fiddling with languages, or turning off odd combinations of graphical settings - none of these options have worked for me.  I'm currently at 60 minutes played, but I'm barely past the 15 minute mark due to how many times my game has crashed and I have had to restart while trouble shooting the problems.

So far the crashes I have experience have been:

1) Crashing before loading a save;
2) Crashing after leaving a specific room early in the game; and
3) Crashing after climbing down a ladder in the above mentioned room.

I understand that different hardware and software configurations can throw a wrench in a games performance, but after two solid years of opportunity to fix the multiple issues that are game breaking and seemingly nigh impossible to solve, I can't in good faith recommend this title.

This game has received excellent reviews from multiple sites and users, but those were the lucky ones who magically had the game work for them without issue; suffered through frame rate and graphical issues on consoles; or spent the ridiculous amount of time and effort trouble shooting it on their PC.  Unless you're willing to put in the hours of trouble shooting, or are just feeling lucky, I recommend you steer clear of this game, or at the very least ensure you don't exceed the 2 hour mark so you can refund after the inevitable game breaking bugs."
1499,1,0.5246,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I've been wanting to like this game, but I can't. 
I find it extremely boring and I have to force myself to play every time.
When I do I can only manage it for few moments.

The game just get's stale, and it's not scary at all. 
I have not been scared once, I honestly do not see why anyone says it's scary, because it's not.
You're just forced to hide in lockers most of the time, and slowly sneak around.
Sure you get the flame thrower, but that doesn't make things exciting.

Personally, I think this game would be far better if it was more story orintated, and if not most, if not all the characters in the game are dead or will die.
Killing them off at the end is one thing, but no you arrive when everyone is already dead, so you can't experience the chaos as it unfolds around you.

TL:DR
Sorry but not sorry fanboys and girls, I did not like this game. 
It was stale, boring, not scary and repeitive and not a challenge.
They should just call it walk simulator, that's what you're doing most of the time.
You literally can walk around while the alien is in the vents and do what you need to do. 
Just hide when it drops down, or go around it. Easy."

The mechanics are plain broken. I always managed to trigger events and cutscenes without any sense or order, the game seems to expect you to follow their script or it gets weird.

The story doesn't make any sense. When you are in a space station with technical difficulties, why should everyone start shooting like maniacs?

On the other hand you can pretty much crouch untrobled through the whole game. The Alien is very stupid and doesn't seem to realise that you are hiding in plain sight under a table."
1501,3,0.4036,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I couldn't get into this game. I enjoyed the Alien movies, and I like horror games including Frictional's Penumbra series and SOMA which are sci-fi themed. But Alien: Isolation just didn't push any of my buttons. I've really wanted to like it, but it's twice now that I've ended up putting it down, forgetting about it, and uninstalling it.

The pacing is poor, where the first few hours go by without anything really happening. Occasionally, things happen, but these events are puncuated again by long boring exploration. The level design is maddening, where the next objective is sometimes completely obscure (e.g., find a hidden panel in a room, not indicated on a moderately large map containing a dozen rooms). The spaceship environment is cool at first, but quickly becomes generic and repetitive. It felt like way too much backtracking through empty rooms.

The crafting system is uninteresting, with randomly placed crafting materials scattered around the ship, often with too much of one material and too little of another, due to the randomness of the placement. The whole inventory system could have been left out of the game, as it only increased the tedium of exploration and decreased immersion, as you had to look inside every container to find more crafting materials.

I did have a few interesting enemy encounters, but there was some weird randomness in their behavior, like annoying AI that boxed me into a dead end a couple times, with no clear way to have avoided it. I have heard that the enemy AI doesn't exactly improve further into the game. The ones I did encounter were more annoying than scary.

Overall the pacing was the biggest problem. Levels could be tightened up a lot, with clearer objectives, more interesting/likable characters added in, more interesting enemy AI, less crafting. What I associate with Alien: Isolation instead is boring empty rooms and backtracking."
1502,1,0.4937,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Great game plays like the first movie was to watch. 

[h1]Graphic[/h1]
Literally looks like the first movie. Big pixel screen tell you the story. Ramdom clutterd items show you people lived in this space station and space ship. The whole stetting is very fitting for an alien title.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You play as the daughter Ellen Ripley to find out what happen in the first movie. Also Alien because its in the title...

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
This is no power fantasy, you are a weak survivor and you have to avoid the Alien.

Now to the points of spoiler and why I do not recommend this game.

[spoiler]You have to hide and distract the alien to not devour you, but its very random if the alien will be distracted and not instant kill you. Most of the sections are limited to one hallway or maybe 2 so you have to go the way of the alien. If the distraction works the alien runs to it and after 2 seconds back to block your way. 

If the alien is not running in your path its patroling your mission targets. This is why I do not like the mechanics of the alien. With this, every time you enter a perimiter around your current mission the alien run pass you to be first on the switch to flip. 

A free roaming alien all the time woud be more fun so you coud distract it to stay ahead.

Also the randomness of the alien adds more frustration as fun to the game. After each reload I tryed to distract the alien, sometime it workes for more than 5 seconds, sometime the alien ignored me and all the crafted items and than there ware the times the alien runs without a warning strait to you and forces you to reload. 

A bit more consistant behavior would be nice in a survival game. Changings rules to force the alien to camp mission targets and random reactions to player action are not good game mechanics. 

[/spoiler]

But else the game is great."

It took me almost 1 year to complete the game because of lack of motivation, boredom and the fact that the game just didn't feel that great to play instead of watching someone else play it.

I thought the graphics were cool and the 80's themed style was overall cool and pretty to experience but the gameplay just didn't work out properly. The alien AI was just sometimes too good and buggy and I often found myself just walking around and dying completly random whereever and whenever the alien appeared. The game was also quite prolonged which seemed unnecessary since the whole horror experience was enough for a couple of hours and then it should have ended.

I was really excited about this game, I love System Shock 2, Dead Space and ""horror"" type games.  However, I found the gameplay to be repetitive and tedious.  The story might be good but the amount of repetitive sneaking around (mixed in with getting randomly spotted by the Alien - oops you're dead, now you have to redo the last 5 minutes of gameplay to get back to where you were) was just not fun for me.  I could understand the game getting some positive reviews, obviously everyone does not have the same tastes, but I'm really surprised that this won PC Gamer Game of the Year and has such overwhemlingly positive reviews.

I also don't mind stealth games if done right - I played Deus Ex Human Revolution on a full stealth playthrough, but the stealth mechanics in this game seemed overly difficult, even when using the motion tracker to try to watch for hostiles, sometimes it was difficult to tell what was going on.  For a game that basically *requires* stealth, unlike Deus Ex, where it's more of an optional playstyle, the mechanics in my opinion are not up to par.

I would compare this to a prettier version of the Alan Wake games.  If you liked those, you'll probably like this as well.

Big thumbs down for me."

Game still sucks. Haven't even played it anymore. I just saw it in my games list and it angered me that someone could make this garbage and then actually sell it. 


This is a terrible game. I cannot believe it has any good ratings. There is no stealth system present in this game. As soon as you are in range of a mob, it immediately knows where you are. Lighting, obstacles and sound are completely irrelevant, as they just know where you are and track you as such.
I've played for almost 4 hours, and I still haven't even seen a xenomorph. So far, just a bunch of psychic, night vision wielding humans that can shoot you through metal walls. 
The menu and ""crafting"" system is unnecessarily convoluted, and more of a hindrance than a feature.
Graphics and ambiance are top notch, but ruined by the rest of the game.
All in all, a terrible game that should not have seen the light of day. Nothing different than any of the other crap Alien games. I am just glad that I waited until it was $10, although that was far too expensive for this abortion of a game."

1510,2,0.3244,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","The only reason I'm giving this game a negative review is the AI system. Some how the Alien only reacts to noice you the player make. No matter how much noice or how loudly your fellow survivors talk, the Alien only responses to you. For example; I could have a gun fight with other survivors over some supplies and have the Alien interfere the fight. The Alien runs across the room, through the gun fire dodges every bullet (shooting the Alien does nothing to it) and even ignores other survivors, concentrating only on me. Then it proceeds to chest fuck me and I have to start the whole ordeal all over again. 
Using computers or any interactive elements in this game is a fucking tease. Getting on a computer takes a good 5-8 second and so does getting off one, wich is pain specially in a game that punishes you for a split second errors.
 I wouldn't categorize this game as an horror game, but rather an annoying game. Almost all of the deaths I've had so far have been cheap ones. This time the Alien spawned right behind me after loading the level and on the next time it didn't.
 Every thing you do is based on good luck. 
I hate to say it but I've been more frustrated by this game than scared.

As things are though, Considering that I got this in a sale, The AMAZING first act and the equally Amazing Visuals on ballance the negatives outweigh the positives.  Ultimately When I finished this I was not left with a feeling of enjoyment or achivement but rather feeling glad it was finally all over, and for the wrong reasons.  I should add that this is one of those strange cases where the DLC is actually better than the Main Feature.

Well, I guess this is what happens when a AAA artistic team are paired with an inept programming team and Corperate ""Suits"", good graphics alone do not a good game make and sadly this is not the ""Outlast in Space"" that people were lead to believe it was.
So yes, Visually this is Amazing, Smooth and Consistently faithful to the Source Material.  Same goes for the Sound and the Musc Score.  The Look and movement of the Monster are also very well done, however this is the Alien with ""Matrix Super Powers"" of the later action based films and not the Stalking, Threatening Monster of the 1979 Film.  For some strange reason they have given the creature Human Hands rather than Alien Hands....I have no idea why either.
As I said the First Act is one of the scariest Games I have ever played but then it all goes downhill pretty rapidly from there.

So what went wrong?

Well, 70% of this Game is just Padding to make it look bigger than it actually is.  In many ways it reminded me of Thirnteenth Skull (and why that game bommbed as well) in that while it is visually very good most of the Gameplay is just doing pointless stuff to drag things out.  Without making too many spoilers  what you will encounter here is Hours and Hours of say, finding components to open a door or fix a Computer, only to find that after going through all that the way is Blocked after all and the Computer Doesn't work anyway.  Completely Pointless and completely annoying.

Secondly The Monster, as good as it is, has been WAY too over used in this Title, which both cheapens the effect of the Scares and the Dread. If they had kept the Appearence of The Alien like that of The Nemesis from RE3 then the effect would have worked much better.   I wish that Games were desigend by actual Fans again and not Corperate Suits  who seem to think that Making a game Virtually Unplayble = Challenge, Clunky, Fiddely controls = Immersion and Boring, Repetative Backtracking = Progression.

The controles are an absolute nightmare, it really is so bad.  I'v not experienced such an awkward, badly designed, clunky, buggy and unresponsive controle system since ZOIDS on the C64. They really are awful.

The final straw, and this really was the deal breaker, after all that  we don't even get an ending!?!        Seriously, remember what happened in the final episode of The Sopranos?  Well that's what you    get for all your investment in this game, it literally just stops midway through a scene and then the credits roll.  That's it!!    It's one of the most infuriating I'v seen and made me resent the hours of investment I put into this. 

 If SEGA could have kept the momentum going from the first act then this would have been Amazing  but as things are all I can say is If you can get this as a complete package for a cheap price then I would advise going right to the DLC otherwise you may just give up on it.  Sorry I couldn't be more positive."

But I am definitely disappointed - the graphics and presentation are great, but the stealth mechamics are terrible. It's not like most other stealth games, where every area is kind of like a puzzle that you have to solve or where even if you get caught you have a change to survive. Here you get caught - you die instatly. And the alien is always teleporting around, always magically entering the room you are in. Doesn't matter if you sneak all the time, it will always somehow be in the next room and the you turn the corner it will kill you. The tracking device barely helps - the radius is pitiful and I've had many moments where it's barely beeping only to turn a corner and stare the alien in the face. The game is just running around and hiding in cupboards, hoping the alien will leave soon. Sometimes it will even find you in the cupboard, for no explicable reason.

As a lifelong fan of the movies (especially Aliens) they captured the vibe of the movie perfectly.  It's scary, intense and was an absolute joy to play.  But the mechanics eventually killed it for me.

Once the game's mechanics are figured out it's not hard at all.  Hit a wall or make some other noise, wait for the Alien to charge in, and sneak out of the room to the next destination.  But it all became a bit tedious.  There's only so many lockers one can hide in and tables to crawl under until the ""ok, I get it"" phase settles in.

I read that playing on hard (as it's ""meant to be played"") is not the best option and I've come to agree - perhaps this is why I haven't come to enjoy the game as much as some others.  I just felt like the Alien was always onto me and no matter what clever trick I came up with it was never really enough to get away from it long enough to make some satisfying progress.  Even when there was an entire ship's level the Alien could investigate, the Alien suspicously always seemed to be in the general viscinity that I was in even if I made absolutely zero noise and always crouched (which also got extremely annoying).

Fighting against the androids was more fun than the Alien because when they did see you it didn't mean instant death, there was a chance to escape, evade or fight.

The biggest flaw is the inability to throw anything other than what is crafted!  Throwing stuff as a distraction is stealth game 101 and this would have alleviated some of the tediousness of the first few levels.  Seeing a bottle in front of your face without the ability to grab and throw it really killed the immersion for me.

And the DLC?  Takes 30 minutes to finish and there's no ability to save.  I feel sorry for the suckers who paid full price for that, even if the fan service was spot on.

I'm torn.  I'm not going to recommend this game but I'm not saying that perhaps you won't enjoy it, either.  Just avoid the ""hard"" difficulty and perhaps the Alien's AI will be less omniscient, which would go a long way to improving the experience and allow you to feel like you can legitimately trick and evade the Alien."

I'm writing this game as fan of the Alien(1979), Aliens(1986), and Prometheus(2012) movies.

Alien:Isolation is awesome game that has very scary and interesting early game, however that's when the fun stops.. after progressing to mid-end game the story turns into a slog. I was so frustrated with the attempts to extend the game every time you were about to ""complete"" it.

Sevastopol is great piece of junk, it looks great. I did love and hate it at the same time. The Space station feels like old claustrofobic soviet vessel, i did hate every part of beign on the ship.. wanting to get out. I think thats the right feeling developers were after.

Lack of windows make it eaven worse, i were often wondering how horrible it would be to actually live on the station (before the alien outbreak)

The best moment i had in the game was to see this horrible piece of junk burn and explode into the planet. I was cheering the whole cutscene.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

* Graphics, Sevastopol looks great! It's just like in Alien movies.

* Sound & Atmosphere

* Sounds of the alien lurking in vents and nearby is very scary

* Minigames are fun and intense if there is alien nearby

* Sevastopol is very claustrofobic and MAKES you want to get out of it as soon as possible.

* Visiting the Engineer ship was one of the best parts of the game!

* Parts where you operate outside the station

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

* Story has so many silly excuses to continue when you are so close to completing it, dragging the story for way too long. 

* Game loses it's scare factor after Alien dies.

* You enter alien Hive but never encounter the Queen.. i was expecting her from this point to the last cutscene.

* Alien is not scary after a while, it's incredibly frustrating when you have to play same 30min part over and over again.

* Game is long because you will die a lot and play the same part so many times you want to stop playing

* Aliens can live outside the station in space, what?

* The Story elements were too much similar to events of the movies

* I was sometimes just standing behind the alien and laughing as it just stood there doing nothing (the part when you wait the ambulance capsule to open)

[h1]Total:[/h1]

Graphics - 10
Sound - 10
A.I - 7
Gameplay - 6 (early game 9)
Story - 6

Alot of the time it genuinely seems impossible to avoid.
There have been times when i have been in a room, the alien appears, i leave and enter another room and there is the alien again all in the space of maybe 5 seconds and another section where nomatter which vent you walk under the alien will be there waiting (instant death) its as if there is an alien for every single ceiling vent.
This game however is absolutely beautiful to look at and sounds as good as it looks however i was expecting some specific sounds from the films to feature such as the motion tracker blip but they are not there for some reason, I found this dissapointing.
I really wanted to like this game because its......Alien...... but so far, when i get enjoyment from it the Alien crushes it with blinding speed.
Watch the films instead. Alien, Aliens and Alien 3, the rest are a bit crap, I hope you already  knew that."

first 3 hours of the game are interesting, and when Alien starts appearing things get quite fun for 1 hour. The unpredictable AI was porbably a good idea on paper and has a nice ring to it however technically its really bad and abnoxious i passed 1 FUCKING HOUR on a small level because i had to stay under a desk, inside a locker, in other words hidden, because the fucking alien was constatly in the area and sometimes in the small room that i was hidden. I dont want to play a game where i have to stay still during 10 to 15 minutes. Got bored, didnt even finish and cannot refund DO NOT RECOMEND"
1542,1,0.5568,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","- buggy
- uses save points that aren't frequent enough"
1543,3,0.4145,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I really really wanted to enjoy this game, and at points I did. However, I must give it a reluctant thumbs down for reasons that will be explained.

Pros:
-Amazing Atmosphere that perfectly captures the feel of the first movie (and to a lesser extent the second).
-Terrifying gameplay that initially is quite interesting.
-A world that is rich and full of lore.
-Good equipment, decent crafting, good progression of weapon acquisition.

Cons:
To be honest, there's only one major con that I can think of, and it's the con that prevents me from giving this game a thumbs up. This game is basically a Waiting Simulator. You spend the vast majority of your time waiting for the patrolling badguy (usually the Alien) to move away far enough so that you can jump into the next box/locker/hiding spot a little bit further along the path you are taking. The interval of actually being able to play is so low that after 20 hours of this, you start to realize that you've spent at least 75% of your playing time just hiding and waiting.

This is interesting and terrifying at first, but after many, many hours of the Alien ALWAYS knowing the exact area you are in at all times and deciding to patrol that area over any other area, you start to become a bit bored. You get maybe 10 second intervals to actually play, then boom, it's another 2 minutes of waiting for the alien to go away. Yes, yes, some will say that you can craft things to distract the alien, but that's only a temporary solution. 

I swear, towards the end of the game, I just wanted to play the damn game! But I rarely ever got a chance to take in the amazing environments or interesting bits of storyline because my entire screen was the view from the inside of a locker or cabinet, etc. The player is given some amazing tools, tools that in any other game would restore a bit of agency to the player, allowing them to control their own destiny. Yet, just as in the beginning of the game, you're entirely dependent on the patrol schedule of the alien and its perfect awareness of your general location.

Halfway through the game, an event happens that enables you to move more freely for a duration of time. This was the best part of the entire game for me and was extremely fun. However, once again, the game decides to return to its roots for the remainder of the game.

In short, it's easy to avoid the alien, but you end up spending the vast majority of your time just hiding.

Maybe some people like this type of game. If you do, then I recommend this game for you. I prefer a little more agency in my games. I felt like this game would have been better off as a movie itself rather than forcing players to wait....and wait....and wait....and wait.

Verdict: Game concept, great atmosphere, great enemy in the game, great story and interesting developments....all of which are wrecked by the game's overpowered AI and obsession with making you wait. This is barely a 8 hour game that has been strung out to a much longer game time primarily because of the forced waiting.

P.S. - The ending is a little lame. Just a little. About 30% lame.

The alien does keep you in constant suspense, but once you die to it more than a few times it stops playing like a horror game and more like a rhythm game, miss one step and you die.

1554,1,0.2874,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Well guys, this is a rly tough one. Never before have a seen such a well made enviroment, atmosphere, graphic and sounddesign, the devs should get oscars for their work. So why no recommandation then? Gameplay is mostly enjoyable, however, some major mechanics are  goddamn awefull. 

1. Saving mechanic 
Well i know its part of the thrill if u cant save anytime, however, if u look a point 3, ull understand why a savepoint save-mechanic in this game is just horrible broken.

2. Controlling with mouse and keyboard ...
Are actually a disadvantage ... for example, u cant have a toggled aim, for players like me, that play all their fps game with ads toggle, this is just bs. The game isnt rly about combat, but if u have to use ur flamethrower just to kill those facehuggers, cause ur unable to hit them reliable with guns, and u know u need that precious fuel to deal with the big boys, its just annoying, annoying as shit guys.

3. Unpredictable alien 
Yeah it is in some way, and thats why a savepoint save-mechanic is utterly broken. Some examples. You are never rly save, nowhere, a hide that worked perfect through out all the game, suddenly become useless and the alien just drags u out of locker or from under a desk, without even seeing u before. Sometimes the alien will lock its self and you down a an area with security cams, the alien will trigger them, react to the noise and stay, when the alarm goes off, the alien starts moving again, and guess what, triggers the cam again ... The alien will endure up to 3 flameburst untill it fucks off, u never know if one is enough or not and like a said earlier, its all about that fuel man.

3.5 Crouch Crouch Crouch!
Due the fact this alien is ""so"" unpredictable, it will always just stalk you, ignores synthetics completley and will always stick close to you.*[SPOILER ALERT] There is just not one alien on the station, its infested with a whole brood, so i kind of understand why one of them is always on your toe, but its still just and awefull gamedesign.* There is mod that i would highly recommand if u want to play this game --> http://www.moddb.com/mods/unpredictable-alien-mod
Basically, this mod just gives a real thril of ssudden encounteres with the creature, rather than knowing its there all the time. It will patrol the whole station, not just the small area u r currently at. Without the mod, u have to crouch almost continuesly through the alien levels, With the mod, u can walk or run sometimes and just need to be super stealthy if the alien is on ur toe. Also like a said earlier, those rdm encounteres make the game far more thrilling.

4. Story. Guys the story, man the story. It starts so fucking good, just to become that common aliene franchise canon at the end. The company wants to preserve the aliene rather than killing it and sacrafices willingly every human to achieve this goal. *[SPOILER WARNING] Why the fuck is there and alien queen aboard? Well u dont see her nor have to fight here, but you know some parts of the sevastopol are just covered in this organic structures known from the movie, and that imho, is a proof for the existence of a queen. Since when are aliens able to just have a walk in space, they dont need to breath, they dont freeze??? WTF??? Of course, somehow the aliens get aboard the torrents, the rescue ship, despite, beeing blown away by a gravivity blast 3 seconds earlier ... But u know aliens can survive in space, probably they are even able to fly there ...*


This rly hurts, to give masterpiece, plugged by mentioned issues a thumbs down. When i finally reached the pathetic, disappointing ending, i just wished i could get a pulserifle and shoot that freaking alien bastard. Will you shit ur pants, playing this at night with headphones? Def.! Will you be so fucking frustrated at some points that u just screw it? Yes, many, many, maaaaaany times.

The rest of this review is just devellopment on why I find the game stupid and dull. 
Here is the complete playthrough : -Hey Ridley I have a new plan to kill the alien go there open the red door with the red key and then push the green button three times, oh s**t something went wrong come back. Rinse and repeat x10. 
The crafting system is just pointless, you always craft the same stupid medkit. 
Also the alien is the worst pain in the butt he will ALWAYS be in the same corridor you are in, don't worry he's not specificaly after you he just happened to be there, you know, just taking a walk, wandering by, chilin' in the station, taking a break, killing time, to make sure you have something to hide from or the game would have been pointless ...

My main problem with the gameplay is that FAR too much of it relies on pure chance. The Xenomorph *might* see you under that desk this time or it might not. There’s not much *you* can do about it.

It definitely deserves the praise it gets for not compromising on suspense, the game forces you to be patient and resourceful, like in Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Unlike Amnesia though, it's ultimately incredibly predictable, and just feels like Doom 3 all over again with uninspired data logs and endless industrial corridors of switch-pulling and doors and flashlights. And also unlike Amnesia, it wasn't... scary...???

Get this game if you've already decided you really want to like it, want your horror genre/Alien fan fix and you won't be dissappointed. Or surprised.

Set some time after the first Alien movie, you play Ripleys daughter in trying to find out what happened only to be stranded yourself. You have to rely on stealth and the ability to knock up some, somewhat, useful items, like noisemakers, emp grenades etc. The problem is, the game is unforgiving. You will die so many times that the game eventually doesn't make you scared, it just downright, pisses you off. The lack of save points is horrible as you cannot even save between points on the map. You might see the save point and just reach it when..BAM...you get wiped out by either a gaggle of synthetics or a spike through the chest. You will then have to start all over again from the last save point which is very bloody frustrating. I have owned this game now for a number of months and have resigned myself to the fact that I just can be arsed to finish it any more as all it now does is wind me up so much. It's gone beyond the point of scary or suspensful and is now at the point of ""I wish I had never bought the damn game""

Instead, it got tedious, annoying and lost its scare-factor. I was more intimidated by working Joes and environmental hazard than the alien itself after a while, but even these behaved really weirdly and seemed to be able to look through walls and approach me the moment I got too close to them ignoring how quiet I moved and stayed out of sight.

A few tweaks to the enemy AI and a little less alien presence would have made me recommend this game. The setting is otherwise flawless."

1569,3,0.5796,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","A staggeringly astonishing game world, overflowing with detail and care to the source material, with gameplay that won't let you enjoy it. That's what Alien: Isolation is like.

Isolation's gameplay just doesn't work. At all. At least, not for long after it introduces itself. There's the Alien, the Alien is a walking failure condition made of terrifying death, and at first that's freaking amazing and worthy of praise. The thing scares the hell out of you and turns this into an intense hide-under-the-desk simulator, which I mean in the best way possible.

But then the developers ride with the formula of ""avoid the Alien"" for most of the entire game. When they're not riding that, they're going with weird ""avoid the androids"" FPS-like gameplay that doesn't really work, either.

You have no idea how much I wanted to just enjoy the atmosphere in a way that balanced out being an authentic Alien experience (which it does do) and being enjoyable (which it doesn't do). Having opportunities to explore the whole space station, everything that it had in it, because I was in love with the stupid thing. But the game doesn't let you. Even on the easiest difficulty, that Alien starts to get on your nerves as much as it frightens you, because once it hears, sees, or freaking smells you, you're done. You're dead. You're reloading your last save. There's no way around it. And it moves randomly in almost completely unpredictable directions for no apparent reason, which doesn't help, because it just makes the Alien look stupid, not in any way goal-oriented or intelligent manner--much less, the ""perfect organism"" it should be.

Alien: Isolation is a beautiful, top-of-its-class experience at first. It makes you want to yell, ""YES. YES. THEY MADE UP FOR COLONIAL MARINES. THEY ACTUALLY SAVED THE FRANCHISE."" But the gameplay just doesn't let you enjoy almost any of it due to the random nature of the Alien, its primary gameplay mechanic, and the fact that it's totally unpredictable, but in a way that's frustrating, not thrilling or exciting. The game gets progressively worse as it goes on until it infuriates you, and you might lose interest before you get to its conclusion."

The gameplay is not a true Survival Horror or First Person Shooter, as the tags say, because lacks of recourses and options to be so. The mechanics for stealth, craft and combat are insufficient to face a enemy inmortal, ubiquitous, infallible and lethal at first and last contact. 

The Alien AI is cheater: always appears in certain places, even if player are moving very sneak up, and roams open places without any clear objetive, a behavior never seen in any film, specially the first one, that pretends to emule. The player moviment is cheater: can not jump, even little obstacles in corridors, but can climb within ducts (?). 

The concept of realism and fun of developers consists in propose a weak main character for shunning from dangers, dying a lot in learning process, and open dozens of doors by the way. 

There are a crafting system, but although the protagonist is engineer, needs blueprints to make only 9 kinds of things. Besides, is uncapable of to seal any common duct or door. Her professional skill only serves to open them, or to activate reallly useless distractions. 

There are only 8 weapons ingame, of them only 3 craftables and the rest not availables since beginning or from fallen enemies. Only 3 weapons can stop the Alien, none can kill it. Only 2 dispositives can distract it by a time. There are not armours. Maps are lineal and reusables.

In spite of great job of marketing, this product is only for fans of hide and seek, youngsters and impresionable people that believes fighting for surviving consists in avoid the conflict, that violence is not a smart option and shooter games are for dumbs. Flee and hide for survive is the coolest trend in videogames for the smartest ones."

I was caught in a hospital level that was so small, I always bumped into the Alien, no matter what I tried. 2) Game design: feel like a ride rather than open world scouting. With save stations to reach, it can be very frustrating to be killed when you've managed to almost finish the mission... you simply restart from last save. 3) Mechanics: The control logic (I am using an XBox controller)  is a mere insolence -- when quick reaction is needed you typically have to use more than one button, ""select"" a weapon while you're being attacked! One word about the atmosphere... yes, it works to have the motion tracker on and listen for every sound above or below you... but boy does it get dumb after a while. There's no logic behind the Alien's movement, it just enters and leaves, just to enter again.

There are power terminals you can hack, but it is never explained what you should try to achieve. The patroling humans can spot you from a mile away, and all have guns. Like, what is this?

The game can often be rather buggy, with hitboxes that tend to 'snag' on you, less than acceptable AI, and drags on for far too long. While I definitely enjoyed the first half of the game, after that the alien encounters became more frequent, and the game became something more artificial, more scripted, more obvious and predictable. It kept dragging itself longer and longer, forcing you to do rather annoying tasks while you have to evade the AI, which I'd describe as a mix of very abusable, but very unforgiving. The second half of the game became such a grind, such a chore to do, that it killed my enjoyment for it completely. The worst part is I don't see *why* the developer studio felt the need to drag the game on for around 3 to 4 hours, constantly use cutscenes to set your finish line another ten miles away every time you get to it. The game didn't suceed in scarying me, it suceeded in frustrating me. I took full advantage of the crafting system to build items to avoid as many encounters as possible, and so will you when you play this, because this is not a game that will make you feel like you've enjoyed playing it once you see the credits roll.

On top of that, a lot of the game mechanics and level designs are pathetically archaic. I felt like I was playing FEAR or the original Halo at times because the game would give you no clue where to go, or it would tell you the wrong area to search because it's so broken in a dozen ways.

1583,2,0.4241,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","Someone bought me this during the steam sale. I gave it an honest try, but I've got to say... It's not really that fun. At first there was a serious ""Boarding USG Ishimura"" vibe, but then it turns into a brutally punishing stealth game.

I mean, I get that the alien is invulnerable, even if I disagree with that, but the humans and robots are not... But there's not enough ammo and gadgets to fight them, not even if you're very clever, and there's no Metal Gear-style way to assassinate them if you sneak up into melee range undetected. You'll resort to making hit-and-run melee strikes on the robot's backs, hitting them twice quickly with a giant hammer that feels like lovetapping them with a nerf sword, then running to hide in a vent for four minutes to make them go back to their derping-around post, only to do it again, and again, and again. NOT fun, NOT entertaining. I found myself looking for cheats to give myself ammo and gadget-making stuff so I could just have a FAIR FIGHT, and then said ""why am I bothering? I don't even like this franchise.""

And of course, the moment ANY enemy sees you, all of their mates know exactly where you are: justified for the robots (radio,) but not for humans.

In short: It could have been a fun action-horror game with one BIG BAD that you always had to run/hide from, but instead it's just not fun, because every enemy is basically overpowering and there's no stealth takedowns, it is not. Go play Metal Gear Solid V if you want tactical stealth action, go play Dead Space 2 if you want action horror on a giant eff-off space station.

[edit]Post-Completion addendum.
I don't know why I did this to myself. I really do not.
Anyway, with enough modding, Alien Isolation becomes playable; primarily this entails allowing firearms to damage the Xenomorph (Mr. Happy as I had taken to calling him,) which drives him off, greatly increasing the amount of all finished goods and ammunition you can carry, modifying the flamethrower so it eats fuel half as fast, and modifying the item construction recipes so that they also give you some ammo when used.

And after enough modding, the game became... Playable. With a satisfactory quantity of firearms and firearm accessories (bullets,) fighting against hostile humans and androids became fun, but Mr. Happy became more... Well, chasing him off wasn't hard, but he was always present, necessitating frequent hide-tanning, and any one screw-up on my part led to instant death. As it should be, I guess, if that's how you like your games.

Anyway, I suffered through the whole slog to the end, to find out that they... Basically copied the ending of the first Dead Space. SPOILERS BELOW THIS POINT: YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

Basically? Everybody dies. EVERYBODY dies. Ripley gets captured by an alien at one point, in a thoroughly BS encounter (seriously, who in god's name puts a GIANT AIR DUCT in an AIRLOCK,) leaving it an open question whether or not she got implanted while she was unconscious. Meanwhile, the station went to hell, and you escape on the ship you got in on, only for a xenomorph to have somehow boarded it. You would have thought that an alium wouldn't have been able to board a ship in space without causing a huge noticeable hull breach, but no. Ripley survives by blowing herself out an airlock yet again, leaving her floating in space alone, and then a flash  oflight and sci-fi woo-woo sound implies that someone showed up as she was losing consciousness. Credits roll.

Expect Alien Isolation 2 to take place aboard an improbably huge mining vessel with a psych ward in which Amanda is trapped, as everything is going to hell in a handbasket."
1584,1,0.4134,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I have mixed feelings about this game. 

On the one hand, we have the technical aspects, which are positive:
- the game is very (I mean VERY) well optimized, runs butter smooth in ultra on my 4 year rig (i5-2320, GTX 750, 8GB RAM etc.)
- the design is very nice, a clear continuation of the original Alien movie (everything looks like designed in the 80s)

Gameplay-wise, there are some strong points too:
- atmosphere is top notch, the space station is scary enough without feeling cheap
- the crafting system and the tools are a nice touch
- the sounds are good, everything creaks, beeps, things go bump in the night etc.
- I was scared sh|tless playing hide and seek with the alien (for a while that is)

But then there were some aspects of the game which totally broke immersion for me, and were annoying as hell.
- People having no problem ""accidentally"" running into you in a very large hall, no matter what; yet not noticing you when you literally are an arms length away. This is no joke: in Mission 3 I was crouching in the corner just beside the door and a guy entering the same door walked by me twice like a blind bat.
- The Alien wandering ""accidentally"" always in your vicinity in the missions you have to evade it. It has the whole hospital floor for itself, yet you always have to hide in lockers and hold your breath. It's like the alien can't see you, can't hear you, can't smell you from a distance, yet is drawn to you somehow. This made the hide and seek a trial and error for me, and poof, the suspence and terror was gone after a while. 

I had the feeling that a lot of encounters were scripted to a point where the question was not ""How can I solve this?"" but ""How do the developers want me to solve this?"".

I gave the game thumbs down, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this is a bad game. If you're not bothered by the negative aspects I mentioned, then you should definitely try it. Especially while on sale (that's how I got it anyway)."

1588,1,0.5331,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","EDIT: 

I'm rewriting this review because over time I've come to change my mind about this game. 

I had originally NOT recommended this game and I'll leave it as that because that's how I felt right after I finished the game.  But in retrospect that's being a bit too harsh to the game.  This is a rewritten review about this game, because it's probably a bit unfair to the game to not recommend it.  Also by leaving it as not recommended you can see why someone might NOT want to play it, even though it's actually probably worth playing.

So the pros to this game are the atmosphere of the game is very good.  The way the game works is also quite good leaving you with some very fun game play and some incredibly pulse pounding moments.  You can really get into the whole sneaking around or you will get killed aspect of the game.  The fact that the Alien acts different (usually) and changes things up (usually) makes it all the more exciting too.  You can't always use the same techniques because it doesn't always do the same things too.  That's why you should play it.  The story is pretty engaging too.

Ok, so that all sounds great so why did I initially give this (and it's still on) not recommended?

There's three things really.  Let's go over the minor stuff first (that if it was it, it wouldn't be a big deal, but they are minor negatives to a great game).

1.  Bugs.  I only ran into one clear bug, but it was a doozy.  Luckily it was in the first 10 minutes of the game, but I played it a bit, then shelved the game for a few weeks, then got back to it.  I explored EVERYWHERE and I couldn't figure out where to go.  I combed the map for an hour and couldn't figure out what was next.   I finally Youtubed it and found... you're supposed to go through this hallway, but on MY version that hallway had a sealed door.  There was another way through too.  That door was also sealed.  I restarted the game from the beginning and this time those doors were open.  

2.  The story is pretty good, but I got annoyed at the end where I felt started to take liberties.  ""Oh we need to amp up the action so we'll do this which doesn't quite make sense in the scheme of the story, but whatever, it's fine we'll do it anyways.""  It only starts to appear at the end of the game, but it annoyed me.    On the plus side though it did enable some interesting game play parts.  But like the one part of the game included a super cheesy ""this doesn't make sense but we're going to have the Alien be somewhere it really makes no sense for it to be.""

3.  Ok, this is the main reason I gave it a do not recommend at first.  The AI of the Alien is great and it's fun... only when it's not.  

First, the Alien obviously hides, is unkillable, and kills you very easily.  That's totallly fine and is expected.

The Alien acts differently and supposedly can learn new behaviors.  That's actually pretty awesome and a huge selling point (and they did use this as a selling point).  

The Alien is extremely fast.  Now this is a plus and minus.  It's a plus because it makes the Alien scary as heck but it's a minus because imagine having to sneak around at 1/10th the speed of someone.  They can not see you but if they happen to appear and walk your way while you're crossing a room you're screwed.  You can't cross it  at your speed before it gets close enough to see you.  If you run, you can easily get by and hide but if you run it's loud and pretty much an instant death if the Alien is anywhere near you.  The motion detector is nice but the Alien can be pretty far away and close the distance within 2-3 seconds.  It can take you 5 seconds to cross a room.  As you can guess, this can cause some really annoying deaths.  

And if it were just that, the game would still be great, but thing is the AI doesn't act like it should sometimes.  I've seen it just patrol 2 rooms non stop when I was in one of them, motionless and hidden.  I had died multiple times with it coming back and catching me doing something so I waited once and just watched it walk back and forth.  That's clearly scripted behavior which is weird because it doesn't act like that normally.  But even that part wasn't too bad.

There were two other parts that just made me tear my hair out.   It was basically a long sequence where I had to get to a certain place.  The Alien would get me in some totally b.s. way when I was 70-85% of the way there.   Be it seeing me when it shouldn't have (from another room, and I'm hiding behind something), or me opening a door and having it decide to stroll on by while I'm in the middle of opening the door and killing me.  I died like 30 times on that one part.

Then there was another part where I died like 40 times.  The deaths were frequently b.s. deaths.  And all of those BS deaths left a bad taste in my mouth.   Ugh.  Without those two frustrating parts, the game was fine though.  And the thing is those parts weren't supposed to be that frustrating; like the first one is just a normal part of the game, but for some reason the Alien kept on getting me.  The second part is supposed to be a fairly challenging part but there's other parts that were supposed to be harder that I passed without dying nearly that much.

Ugh."
1589,1,0.4865,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","It's such a shame that this game sucks.

I love the Alien films, and the original Alien vs Predator game was amazing, but as much as I wanted to play through this game and experience the story and characters, it failed on mechanics and basic gameplay.

Mechanically the game gives you very little control over what you can do to overcome a situation.

It's hard to explore or understand what you need to do when enemies are around, you have no idea where to go or where to hide until you have run around dying and re-spawning a few times finding where vents and doors are located.

I spent a lot of this game replaying the same area because NPCs with guns would shoot me if I didn't stick to the EXACT path to complete the area (which was not clear at all).

Sometimes I would hide in a vent after being chased by enemies and wait, not knowing if it is safe to exit until I hear the enemies saying they have given up looking for me, and even then they might still be standing right at the vent...

I thought the environment of a shadowy space ship would be the perfect setting for a stealth based survival game but it is in fact horrible when you have no where to hide.

I would rather this game had a 'hiding indicator' like skyrim/oblivion, an objectives screen to see what you need to do in an area or where to go. The ability to jump, climb and potentially go prone and crawl under things...

I can't say this game is for anyone but the MOST patient of gamers and the BIGGEST fans of the Alien films/games."

Contrary to the game's description, this is not really a survival game. Sure, the goal is not to die, but that is true of a very large number of games. What this game actually is is a highly scripted stealth action fps horror game which often plays like a groundhog day nightmare (die a horrible death, but learn where enemies are so you can hopefully get a little farther before dying again).

With that out of the way, I want to say that I wanted to like this game. Being able to explore a space station is a lot of fun, and the metroidvania item progression to unlock new parts of the station had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, this game does have some major issues that ultimately shifted my perception away from fun to annoyance by the time I was done with the game.

First off, the good points. The atmosphere is perfect for an Aliens game, and the (somewhat) freeform Metroidvania exploration was a nice touch where getting new items would unlock new areas to explore. You have guns, but are heavily incentivized to use stealth due to the severely limited ammo and not wanting to attract attention.

Now (unfortunately) to the bad points. Note that I was playing on Novice in hopes of minimizing these so take into account that they will be exacerbated on higher difficulties.

The checkpoint saving system is a PITA. When there are many things that can very quickly kill you, and the heavy stealth focus making for often slow progress, it can easily be 15-20 minutes between checkpoints (even taking into account backtracking to find one). Deaths mean a significant time loss and significantly contributed to my annoyance. The amount of time you stand starting blankly at the save points watching the lights is also completely unnecessary.

Guns are in desperate need of a rebalance. The first gun you get (the revolver) is so pathetically weak (even on novice) and takes so long to reload as to be essentially useless. Either it needed to be significantly more powerful or should have been replaced with a semi-auto pistol with larger clips and faster reloads. The flamethrower goes through fuel too quickly (unless you think a quick half-second burst should use a full liter of fuel) but at least ammo is relatively plentiful in spite of that annoyance. The shotgun has way too loose of a spead (this unfortunately is a sin propogated by far too many shooters) and the bolt gun has too large of a reticle so it's only useful at shotgun ranges anyways. Pipe bombs aren't considered weapons by the weapon scanners (there's a mission where you have to leave your guns behind) but are by far the most powerful means of killing things in the game. Plus, the materials to build them are much more common than ammo.

The battery eating flashlight trope seriously needs to die. Even in the relatively power hungry flashlights of years past they lasted significantly longer than they do in this (and far to many other) games. Flashlight use is discouraged enough as is with the extra attention it draws. At least there's only a handful of places in the game that are actually dark enough to need the flashlight.

Quicktime events and minigames add nothing to games like this and only serve to add another layer of annoyance, forcing you to master a pesky little timed button pushing game that adds no real content. A lot of AAA games from this era did this unfortunately, hopefully they got enough negative feedback to convince the devs not to include it so much in future titles. The computer terminals and rewires don't pause the game and lock you in while using them with no quick way out, so it's very easy to die even if you hear an enemy coming up behind you. When you do abort, you completely log out so it takes a significant amount of time to get back in if you managed to survive being interrupted.

The AI can be very inconsistent. Sometimes they're completely oblivious to your presence, other times they see you from what seems like a mile away. All the enemies exhibit this behavior. The alien has the ability to teleport to your location and randomly appear out of nowhere, killing you so often that it ceases to be scary and simply becomes aggravating.

The scripted events are also quite annoying. There are quite a few scripted events that drag you out of control (or simply are abused to provide a cheap jump scare that you'll be numb to by the end) and put you on a sometimes lengthy detour that doesn't really add anything. The entire ending sequence (between extending the maintence platform and releasing the clamps is a prime example of this, and felt entirely unnecessary.

Normally I applaud a game for having lots of content provided I'm having fun, but this game overall felt like it had overstayed its welcome by the end and did not need to be as long as it was. The Metroidvania elements were ultimately wasted by the end since there wasn't really an indication of when it would be a good time to go back and visit the rooms I couldn't get into before, and now that I've been annoyed I'm not about to go back and replay to go find everything.

Overall, not a bad game per se, but definitely needed another rebalance and editing pass. It's a decent stealth horror game so pick it up on sale if you like those types of games or are an Aliens fan, otherwise stay away. Not really worth the full asking price IMHO."
1599,3,0.3455,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Quite honestly, this game doesn't have very many memorable moments that are distinctive from other games and is not fun. There is no real intriguing story behind this game as it doesn't correlate to the movie in the slightest. The Xenomorph's AI is quite terrible, it's very dumb when it needs to be smart, and smart when it needs to be dumb. It also appears in every vent, regardless of where it was previously, therefore, the AI needs a major improvement. Another topic that is controversial regarding the gameplay of this game, would be the save locations. You are only allowed to save in certain locations and even so, the time that is required to save is immense compared to what you could be doing during that amount of time. Along with the extensive amounts of time required to save, the time it takes to get in and out of menus/objects is also terrible, also considering all of the ""error"" files in the computers, the game just wants to find a way to distract you. The game is not fun, and is a waste of money, the amount of gameplay available in the game is very minimal for a $50 game."
1600,3,0.5015,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I\'d been recommended this game by a friend, and was really excited to get playing. The problem is, there are too many little issues that annoyed me and I gave up after a couple of hours... really not good for a game of this price.

The graphics, the sound effects, the maps, they\'re absolutely fine... but here are the bad points which I really suggest you keep in mind.

1 - It took nearly 2 hours of gameplay before I saw my first bit of action, and even that was only hitting a guy with a spanner to knock him down. Really? Come on guys... it\'s an action/horror... give me something to do instead of just walking around aimlessly fulfilling \""find the correct terminal\"" tasks.

2 - There\'s absolutely no help at all. I had to figure out the crouch, sprint buttons because it assumes that you\'ll know them all already(!)

3 - No jumping. This is a big irritation of mine. Hey, there\'s a 2ft high obstacle... let me find the most inconvenient way around it.

4 - The stupid inventory system. Crafting. Watch Dogs nailed it, they made it fun... Alien hasn\'t, it\'s a chore, and a confusing chore at that with no real sense of what I should be looking for or picking up other than \""collect all\"" at every opportunity.

5 - I\'ve got no idea what the remainder of the game was like, because after 2 hours of playing I\'d gotten so bored that I just gave up and started playing Mad Max for the fourth time.

Sorry, a big thumbs down over here... bill it as \""amazing horror\"" all you like, but keep my interest long enough to witness it."

I've spent three hours rubbing against walls trying to figure out where I'm supposed to be going, haven't seen any aliens but a few very pissed off people, one I got to hit over the head.  It could really use a map that makes sense.  Others that can figure out 3d navigation better than I do may like it, but the objectives are so vague I have no idea what the game is asking me to do at most times."
1602,3,0.5584,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Alien: Isolation is the story of Baby Ripley going in search of the presumed dead Mama Ripley.

While Alien: Isolation has some good things going for it, the gameplay itself drags it down and ultimately makes for a highly repetitive and frustrating experience. Alien: Isolation is NOT a shooter. It is a survival horror which plays heavily on stealth elements. Yes there are guns - but they are not a focal point.

The Good: 

- The ambiance is simply fantastic. Everything from the lighting (swirling fans and fog effects) to the clanging of unknown noises in the vents. You feel like you are being hunted. It's awesome.

The Bad

- Simply put the gameplay itself is rather frustrating. In most scenarios your goal is to sneak past enemies without them detecting you. You have ways to execute this by using tactics such as hiding under tables, in closets, behind furniture, and finding alternative routes such as hidden vents. This becomes frustrating because some enemies (ahem, Alien) have close to zero patterns of movement. They seem to move as they please. When the Alien kills you twenty times due to its erratic pathing the game is no longer fun and just becomes obnoxiously tedious.

- The game feels dragged out - far beyond what is necessary. You finish one mission simply to find you now must do something else; the game just keeps putting barriers in your way. This is fine to some degree but at a certain point it no longer feels natural - it simply feels like the designers wanted to make the game longer by forcing you to complete irrelevent things over and over. If I wanted some chores to do I would call my mom.

Overall, Alien: Isolation's environment is beautiful. Unfortunately, the gameplay is not. It is boring, reptitive, and drags on and on with no clear direction or rhyme and reason. 

Alien: Isolation takes about 15 hours to complete.

    [*]Visually gorgerous if highly repetitive
[/list]

[b]Bad points[/b]

[list]
    [*]No originality in the story in any way
    [*]At the end of the day it is incredibly linear (which I don't mind too much in Story games) but the sheer volume of repetitive quests, oh-something-else-needs-fixing-before-I-can-fex-yet-another-=broken-thing, back-tracking and zzzZZZ
    [*]In sapce why do flashlight batteries last barely a few minutes? I mean this is space, right? Beyond NASA ... and yet the batteries in a bloody torch run out 100 x faster than they do on Earth. WTF?
    [*]Controls are clucnky to say the best
    [*]Sealth is dire! I've hear people describe it as great but if an Alien (or human. or Jo) looks right at me whilst I'm moving, not a couple of meteres in front of him and yet can't see me, explain why. I followed an Alien down some open stairs with a flamethrower in my hands wafting it about as he tunred corner after corner and yet he deosn't see me. Another time I'm hiding silently off a beaten path and BOOM ... WTF again?
    [*]Again on stealth, if I run for a moment I get heard from miles away, yet when I'm shouting at someone over comms the Alien is deaf? And no, I am not talking about different areas or 'safe' zones either.
    [*]........and you play this game walking or crawling....................even running is slow. The game feels like tar!
    [*]The crafting system is awful and what you can make from it is 90% a waste of time
    [*]Several of the maps are plain wrong showing content on the 'same level' despite having a lift in the middle
    [*]And the maps.......how awful and dire are they?
    [*]I like open games or linear games. What I don't like is a linear game that suddenly fails to give you any meaningful indication of what you need to do next...
    [*]And the ending (the only reason I played to the end was for the sense of closure, or the hope of something...anything) ... well, this sentence is longer than the end sequence. I think they went home for an early night!
[/list]

If you want to play this for the story then I'd reccomend watching it on YouTube instead. As a 'game' ... there is no true playability. Slow, repetitive and highly frustrating."
1607,3,0.5433,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","They do a great job with many things. It's genuinely scary, it's deeply thematic, they didn't try to reboot the setting like Prometheus (ie the ships and technology is fitting with it being part of the Alien timeline). I was really looking forward to a great experience after the first few hours.

But then when the alien arrives... the gameplay is so much waiting in lockers doing nothing while you wait for the alien to go away. They do a great job building up the scare, but then it arrives and is a huge dissapointment. After the first few times you've had to run and hide in a locker it becomes routine. That isn't challenging or fun, it's boring. So boring I found myself playing on my smartphone while doing it."

1610,3,0.4509,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This is another time when I wish we had a ""Neutral"" recommendation rather than ""Yes/No"". Being a big Aliens fan is the only reason I finished this game as by halfway I was getting very frustrated with it. The graphicl and sound design is phenomenal and it really does look as if you're in the settings of the first film, but the gameplay got rather tedious after several hours. 

The game does little to explain to you how things like the crafting system works except for random loading tips, it was hours before I found out that I can actually commit a salvage compenent to an unfinished item and free up an inventory slot, I wonder how much salvage I left behind in the first half of the game. There are way too many button presses needed for the simplest tasks, I supposed they thought it make things more tense but after a while having to press 3-4 buttons instead of 1 just to open a damn door became tedious. 

The save system is also a love or hate issue, I'm sure that a lot of time was spent just from going back to save points to avoid frustration from another death wiping out half an hour or more of progress. The save points are inconsistent as well, more diffcult areas have very few while really easy ones have many scattered about. 

Then there is the xenomorph AI. For many areas it is fine and some levels have it ""tethered"" to follow you around like it see through walls. For PC players there is a mod that adjusts it, mostly by breaking the tethering, which did help make the game more tense and less frustrating but it's only doing what the developers should have done in the first place. The game feels more tense when the xenomorph may or may not come after you if you make to much noise, when it hangs around indefinitely it quickly becomes more of an annoyance."
1611,1,0.5316,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Unfortunately I bounced off this pretty hard. I was looking forward to it for weeks, set aside a night when the wife was at a party to enjoy it in the dark, and then replayed the same frustrating level about 10 times before quitting. I suppose I should start over again at a lower difficulty level, but then I'd have to walk, very slowly, through the first 2 hrs of this again to get back to where I was. Not worth it. 

The big negative I had is that the NPCs are reactive to where you are, and follow you even though they have no reason to suspect you're there. I guess this is supposed to increase the risk because they always come and search in the area you're hiding, or get suspicious when you're sneaking past them (even though last time it happened they didn't care), but what it really is is annoying because you can't learn to adapt to their patterns or learn how to get better. Instead you just keep throwing yourself at the problem over and over hoping you'll get lucky this time. I was at the point where I was just going to sprint past the humans, but if I'm doing that then what's the point of the stealth game..."

The gameplay is similar to that of games like Outlast, but holy hell it is so bloated that you lose suspense because you’re doing the same thing over and over. 

It’s a good game (graphics, aesthetic and gameplay), but there is one segment in which you just walk and flip a switch that takes over 5 minutes, and all you do is hold forward. 

If it was 4 hours shorter it would be great, but I feel that they extended it to make it feel like you get more for your money, which made the story and enjoy-ability suffer."

You just hide, and hide and hide and hide, in the end the alien still finds you and you start over because game saves are infrequent and especially difficult if there is an enemy near. When hiding, even if you hold your breath and lean back (which are options that you get last second) when the alien is close you are still usually out of luck. Although, you are on a huge space station with hundreds of people on it the one alien is always following you and shows up at just the wrong moment every time, predictably. If the dreary repeditiveness of all that weren't enough in its own right, virtually every other aspect of the game is uinteristing and lacking substantive gameplay.

The sounds and the tension and the tracking all work so well to immerse you fully into a horror setting better than any game since Silent hill and Resident Evil of old. 
Then the Alien shows up and it stays within 30 feet of you at all times. 
It finally wanders off and you make your break, turns around and you're dead.
Hide in a locker, it stands in front of it, walks away, comes back and you're dead.
Throw a noise-maker, make a run for it and end up in another room and it's behind you, you're dead.

I was so excited for this game, I have been following pre-release videos and what not, and eventually bought it.

Just upon opening the menu and even the intro sequences you get an amazing Alien-ish feeling and this sort of 80s atmosphere that continues once you start playing, the environments are amazing! You truly feel like you got yourself onto the set of Alien! Amazing! The sound effects and the overall ambience is also quite good, especially with headphones. And I even like the graphics, and I am not a demanding person when it comes to game gfx.  

But that is, unfortunately, where the positives end. The game is literally unfair. And not that it would be difficult, I played many difficult games and I have never, ever been so frustrated like I am with Alien:Isolation. The save points are crazy far apart from each other, this would be ok if it wasn't for the extremely frustrating Alien AI. Most of the time the flamethrower does nothing to it, hiding in ""closets"" and what not is extremely boring after a short while, human AI that makes noise and draws the Alien out is not getting attacked instead I am getting attacked, I had moments in which the Alien fell through the floor and appeared behind me, times in which the alien would duplicate and times in which it would burst through a closed (locked-down) door like it has a noclip.

I cannot count the amount of unfair deaths I had during my 10 hours of playtime, but what I can say is that I eventually stopped having any fun and just closed the game. Doing everything again and again because of stupid mechanics just killed the atmosphere for me and made me unwilling to continue, because the atmosphere was the only thing holding this together for me. The robot and human AI on the other hand is totally dumb and barely difficult, while sometimes I got shot through walls or crates while hiding, which only kills any further immersion. 

I also have not enjoyed the closet hiding and crafting systems, I feel like it gets very repetitive, immersion breaking and just doesn't fit into the game for or should have been done differently.

I am not sure at this point if I will ever finish this game, I bought the whole deal with all the DLCs and at this point I just feel like uninstalling it. I seriously thought about getting a cheat trainer just to see the rest of the story without stressing my self to death and I basically never, ever cheat except for GTA:SA.

To top it all off AI is inconsistent and bugged out, especially xenomorph one. And human's AI (when behaved as intended) is pretty much too dumb to live. Also all humans can take revolver shot to the head and survive and can see in the darkness and snipe player with revolver from across the room. Oh, have i mentioned that game has long dragged out QTE interactions literally every 2-3 minutes? It does.
And don't even get me started on the fucking ""hold your breath in the locker"" sequence that fails if you release any of the buttons for a moment by teleporting alien from another room to the locker.

I really wanted to like this game.

It is very atmospheric, looks great, gives the sense of claustrophobia. Hiding in closets is not fun though... and that is what you mostly do - passively watching aliens through grids.

Another minus is the crafting system - did the game really need it? I would not think so. It seemed redundant and took me right out of the immersion every time."

1630,3,0.4517,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Originally, the game was interesting, gripping, scary, and genuinely a fun experience. After about 14 hours of gameplay I had hit my wits end. The makers of the game obviously ran out of ideas and decided to just do the lather effect on the gamers. 

If you’re not familiar with this it’s essentially doing the same thing over and over again in different ways. The constant “get to this part of the ship” and then once you arrive “find an alternate route” just became so monotonous making this game aggravating and brutal. The ONLY reason I continued playing another 10 hours of this useless game was just because I am persistent and NEEDED to know how it felt to beat it. I can guarantee you I had no satisfaction besides relief that I could now continue to live my life. 

If you’re a fan of the Alien films, this game made some great connections and they really worked a LOT to make the details concise. They did this and the music even was beautiful done. It was a great homage to the films. It just NEEDS to be shorter. The games beauty was fleetingly lost to the monotonous mission trail that never seemed to end. And when it did, it continued to send you all over the God forsaken ship in circles, feeling incredibly angry again for having to continually turn around and go back to where you came from. 

The best comparison I can make to this game is imagine yourself in a room and one side of the room says “Go to Wall 2 for next step.” and then you walk to the other side of the room and the wall reads, “Go back to Wall 1 for next step.” And you keep repeating this over and over again till eventually you see no point in doing it anymore. That’s what this game does to you. But in the mix of going back an forth they throw aliens, robots, and random human beings who have no reason or backstory to being there.

2/10 mainly because I genuinely appreciated all the work put into it in the beginning. Sound Design, the ships details, the backstory even, the plot structure, the connections to the films (even the small details like sound effects) but sadly they were all overshadowed by the endless exhausting grueling even, end game.

I do not recommend starting this. Or if you do, just quit the game (SPOILER ALERT) When Ripley detaches from the ship the FIRST time."

That goes with the gun issue above, it throws you immediately off the game and you feel you are playing Dragon's Lair but with more interactivity but no enough for a modern game."

With that being said, this game just didn't do it for me. I find myself repeatedly playing the same parts over and over again because I made one little wrong move, or I had an enemy hear me out of literally nowhere. The weapons that they provide the game, while again understanding that this game is not a full on FPS shooter, do nothing to stop even your weakest enemy. I find myself running into a million different enemies each which way that I turn and all in all, it just is not a fun experience. Don't even get me started about how you can't jump.

Her wrists twisted in agony from manipulating the cutting torches. A sadness came over me, I was sad for Ripley, what she endured, poor Ripley.

I'm sad to say I was a little disappointed. While Alien: Isolation delivers on being an excelent port, having a pretty great story, and a great atmosphere, it was overall a letdown, mainly because it failed at being scary.

**Minor Spoilers**

PROS

I think it nailed the atmosphere. Everything feels like it's going to shit and you can't trust anyone or anything. The technology is very interesting, and stayed true to the film.

The port is absolutely fantastic. By default it ran on ultra at 4k(!!!) with all the effects on, and rarely dropped below 60fps. I have a pretty powerful computer, but it's by no means top of the line.

The story was great, and that and the atmosphere was really all that kept me going to completion.

I have 13.9 hours in the game. About 12 of those were for the main story, which is great. It didn't feel arbitralily padded for time. The other 1.9 was for Crew Expendable and Last Survivor DLC, which were very short but decent enough.

CONS

The game can be very frustrating at times, especially with the stealth, and especially in the first half of the game. This is the reason for my negative review, the game was just too frustrating. The humans are very OP. The can see you crouched across the room and shoot you, hear you while crouching (albeit somewhat closely), and definitely hear you walking or running. This is strange, considering the Alien is supposed to be the one to spot you the easiest. You can crouch behind Alien and he won't notice unless you get very close, and walk fairly close without it noticing. He can see you if you stand, but often won't see you if you're crouched like the humans do. The deciding factor is that you can kill humans, but only scare off Alien. Take note that I was playing on Hard, which is the recommended difficulty. At one point the stealth was frustrating enough where I set the difficult to Easy. This didn't change the difficulty of the stealth, it just seemed to make guns do less damage to me.

This ties into the other reason why the other main con: the game just wasn't that scary. Frustration was a big cause of this. When you die towards the end of the level because of something spotting you, often unfairly, you just want to sprint though and ignore everything, If you're frustrated and annoyed, you're not worried about getting killed. This takes away all the fear of being hunted. I found myself many times just trying to find the shortest route possible where I wouldn't get caught, not hiding at all. And it usually worked. If I get caught, just hit escape and load the save. To be fair, I am a horror game veteran. The last horror game I played was SOMA. SOMA wasn't super scary, but I think it has Alien beat by quite a bit. To someone who isn't used to horror games or gets scared easily by horror games, you might have a different opinion.

I will also give the game credit for not relying heavily on cheap jumpscares. There definitely are some, and a lot of them don't work, but most of the fear comes from the feeling of being hunted and isolation (hey, name drop!) It just didn't work as well as I would like.

Working Joes were a weird NPC. If you dislike uncanny valley, mannequins, dolls, etc. then you might be afraid of them. They certainly are creepy. They just aren't threatening. You can easily outwalk them, unless you get cornered. Once you have guns and bombs, they're fairly easy to take down. Otherwise they're just annoying to deal with because they patrol important areas. You know that trope in games where you see a dead guy, but when you get close they're not actually dead and they attack you? Alien: Isolation uses that so many times with the Working Joes. Except in this game you can't do much to stop them when you know they're going to grab you. You can shoot them, but that's going alert everyone nearby. You can't melee them, no matter how hard you try. They use this cheap tactic so often that it stops being startling and starts being a nuisance.

My last gripe is the save system. There are checkpoint you have to manually save at placed sporadically through the station. This is a huge pain point because during very lengthy stealth sections there will be few save points. You will be listening to the same dialogue many times, pulling the same levers, pressing the same buttons, hoping to just get to the next save point. If there were just a few more it wouldn't be as annoying.

I got the game on sale for $15 including all DLC, and for that price I would say it's a worthwhile experience. At the current price of $49.99, $59.99 to get all the DLC, I would say give it a pass. Wait for it to be $15 or less."

You will find yourself running through the same area repeatidy trying to activate random consoles because you have no idea which one will do what you want it to. 

The game gives you little messages like "" Ripley is a non-violent person, but she will defend herself if she needs to"" or "" The survivors are just trying to stay alive, if you leave them alone, they will leave you alone."" Then when you encounter them they immediatly try to kill you. To make matters worse their AI is so bad that the easiest way to get passed them is Lure them all into a door way followed by Bashing their head in with a hammer. 

They will drop guns that you can not pick up, so after you murder five people with a hammer, you loot their bodies for ammo and then leave a pile of guns on the floor which will just dispear soon after.

The atmosphere is great. The plot is solid. And the retro touches in the UI, while cumbersome, really make you feel like you're in an 80's flick.

But the gameplay is laughably broken.
This game should never have made it out of beta in this state.

The controls are clunky and unresponsive. You can't climb over knee-high barriers. You'll get stuck on invisible corners all over the place.  There is NO direction or explanation to anything-- I don't want the devs to hold my hand, but I spent ten minutes trying to pick up a flashlight on the ground in front of me because it didn't LOOK like a flashlight and the contextual command to even acknowledge it's existence wouldn't kick in unless you were standing square over it and looking straight at it. You can't find things unless you already know exactly where they are?

Worst of all, the game mechanics and coding don't work. Enemies can see thorugh walls and will follow a path to you. Not a path that traces your trail, not to any noises you make, not to any distractions you leave (or any one of the thousand that happen on their own) but right to YOU. Incidentally, the enemies are totally silent when they move-- unlike you.
That's not stealth.

 If you pitch a flare into a room ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP, where NO enemy nearby can possibly see or hear it in ANY way. They will all come running to it, and then straight at YOU, regardless of which way you went or which distractions you leave behind.

- The idea of manually saving your game progress seemed amusing at first, but it became annoying way too soon. Since there are no checkpoints and save points are too far apart, when I die, I am forced to hack through the same systems over and over, walk through the same freakin' corridors multiple times whilst praying to God that the alien doesn’t spot me before I make it to the next save point. 

- The character movement isn't fluid whatsoever. Either she must weigh around 400 lbs, or she's running wearing high heels. Character sprinting is one of the worsts I have seen in years. Who the hell moves so slow when the aliens are constantly up their asses? 

- Alien’s response and sensitivity to noise is just too high. You can't run and the presence of explosives and weapons do seem useless most of the time because the noises they make upon using them can easily attract the alien regardless of your location. Hence, I only ended up hoarding weapons, ammunition, and explosives most of the time for no good reason.

- I realized by the time I completed level 12, I did tons and tons of WALKING, the game should seriously have a Walking Simulator tag on it because of the reason I mentioned above. Can't remember the last time it took me 20 hrs to complete just 60% of the story.

The few instances in the story where the Alien isn't glued right to your ass are very refreshing, but those happen far and few in between. 

Think back on Resident Evil 3. Remember how you were being hunted by the Nemesis? And how scary it was whenever he'd show up? Well imagine if the Nemesis showed up in every room of the game, and you had to stop what you're doing two or three times per puzzle to hide from him or its instant game over. Sounds like a chore right? That's this game. 

The most fun I had was at the start of the game before it shows up. You feel an actual dread and fear because you don't know how this creature operates. That changes shortly after the first encounter. All mystery is removed because this thing constantly follows you around and you're forced to take advantage of the various quirks in the Alien's a.i. So you can complete the various puzzles. 

In short: The Alien makes gameplay an absolute chore and it's constant presence around the player removes all horror and mystery in regards to the creature itself.

- gameplay is very slow ; running attracts the alien, so you almost can never run
- the alien can't see, can't hear, can't smell you if you're 3 meters away, but...
- ...but the alien will hear you fart (or run) from hundred of meters away
- the space base looks gigantic (which is awesome!) but the alien will almost never let you alone ; he's always roaming near you, while you're far from being the last survivor here
- despite the alien being super sensitive, other survivors won't care 1 second being noisy, or talking, or anything and will shoot you on sight, which will lead them to a stupid death
- apparently, when there's 1 killing alien in a gigantic space station, the best way to deal with it is to make multiple separate groups of a few individuals who will shoot each others on sight
- the game teaches you how to crouch or press a button, but not any basic of actually being stealth, so when the serious stuff starts, you have freaking no idea what to do and how to do it
- It feels like the heroine is always on the edge of crying all the tears of her body, even when she's saying banal things like ""the door is close"" (and there's an incredible number of closed doors in the game!)
- the story doesn't have any surprising nor thrilling turn (if you have seen the Alien movies, or any scifi or horror movies of the past 40 years)
- the alien is a camper ; he can stay forever in the same zone for no apparent reason
- impossible to kill the alien, to stick to the ambiance of the 1st alien movie, but [spoiler] when there's a lot of aliens at the end of the game (which makes no sense with what we experienced so far), it's still not possible to kill any of them[/spoiler]"

Basically, I felt like nothing I did had any effect on whether I lived or died. It seemed completely random. I'd hide quietly in a closet and the Xenomorph would find me. I'd duck under a desk at the last minute and it'd pass me by. The motion detector would say the Xenomorph was moving away from me and out of range, but then it'd be right outside the door. Other times the sensor would say it was right above me, but then I would move and it wouldn't appear. 

I realize that perhaps if I put the time in I could figure out some rationale for to how to survive, but the frustration got to me. And the game had little to offer besides that. Yes, the creators did a great job recreating the look of the original movie, but that just meant I'd seen it all before. There was no mystery. And there wasn't really much of a story, just a situation. So there was nothing to hook me in to keep me playing.

1669,3,0.6348,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Pros:
- Great atmospehere
- Genuine tension
- Audio design is excellent
- Extremely faithful to the original movie's vison of the future
- Best Alien game available

Cons:
- Linear
- Too long
- Repeating, unimaginative objectives
- Being hunted and killed by the Alien loses its charm (if you can call it charm!) over time
- Losing progress becomes very frustrating


This one's hard to judge. There are things this game nails - the atmosphere, graphics, sense of place, tension (to an extent) - but unfortunately there are apects of this that ultimately sour the experience. For instance, the build up to your initial encounters with the Xenomorph is excellent. The tension is palpable and when you are caught (and you will be caught!) it is a genuine edge of your seat moment. Over time the law of diminishing returns sets in and the Xenomorph no longer proves a terrifying presence but a roadblock to your progress through the game. Save points are few and far between so to be caught and killed by the Alien which sends you back about 20 mins or so can be quite frustrating.

The game is extremely linear (although some people won't mind that) and objectives are familiar throughout. You may have to power on 3 generators to get through a door only to be forced to do the same thing in the next area.

Another complaint I have is that game is too long and wears out its welcome after about the 10 hour mark. There was a point around this time where I thought I was at the end only to find I was half way through the game! After finishing Alien: Isolation, had it ended at around the 10 hour mark I would feel much more postive about the title.

Speaking of positive, the audio design in this game is extremely well implemented. Hearing the Alien crawling through the vents is quite unerving (for a time). 

The visuals are very faithful to the originals view of the future and may be enough for fans of the 1979 Sci-Fi / Horror to invest in this just so they can explore what may as well be an interactive movie set.

All being said this is still arguably the best Alien game on the market and so if you're a fan of the franchise it will probably be worth investing in. However, if you're not a keen Alien fan and are just looking for a new horror game to play, you might be best off looking else where.

Unfortunately being forced to make a choice between recommending this game or not I would probably lean more towards not recommending it simply because I had to force myself to finish the game and that's not how a game should make you feel."

1687,3,0.6194,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I'm aware I'm late to the party when it comes to playing this game. Whoever wanted to buy this game probably already has it by now anyway seeing how frequently this has seen a good discount. But to be honest I don't really get why people were/are raving on about this game. Yes, it's fairly intense at times, has an amazing level of franchise-loyal detail which makes it feel like you're in the first Alien movie, but frankly that's not good enough when you look at gameplay. You only really get to hide in extremely specific places instead of inside anything that looks like it would realistically open. This means you can kind of forget about a truly stealthy approach with a decent challenge; think games like Thief or Hitman (at their highest difficulty of course).

The game also relies upon choke points in it's level design where you'd inevitably run into people / androids that shoot or otherwise try to kill you, without much abilities of luring them away. It seems the game does a poor job streamlining what should be a challenging yet a 'fair fight' compared to fighting or hiding from the much more challenging alien. 

Speaking of which, the game really should give a few more hints about when to expect the arrival of the alien. It seems a full 100% random, instead of based upon the player making noises or even crossing it's previous path. Comparing this game to the great horror game that is Outlast it's very easy to see how this Aliens game is not very fair in it's fundamental design. Outlast gives the players more options, whilst also being more haunting in my opinion. This has a lot to do with the fact that especially early on merely meeting with the alien results in a near-instant death. Needless to say, not a lot of fun and after a few times meeting the alien that way isn't scary anymore.

+lighting, visuals and various other FX are great, makes you feel like in an Alien movie
+enviroments seem plausible in terms of 'franchise-loyal detail'
+voice acting generally is great
+game seems to have a decent enough story, although it'll not have much surprises for fans of the franchise
+concept of survival, including a separate survival challenge mode (although sadly not flawless, this style of game definitely makes sense for an alien game)
+story missions are alright. mostly.
+DLC ; there's more if you want more

-lip synch is a gigantic immersion breaker, really poor stuff here. in fact, most animations are rather bad; including the Alien moving around like some kind of robot. Only the scripted animations look fluid.
-as great as the visuals are, most people in this game do look like plastic dolls. still better than in most games, but to me it's obvious they tried to aim for photorealism and kind of failed. It certainly doesn't look bad though.
-interaction with the alien and the alien AI is very disappointing, some of which seems too random. Other things are time based, with the player hiding in plain sight and the Alien never spotting you.
The more I play the game, the less frightening the Alien becomes because of this. Kind of a shame.

-controls are horrible and clearly suffer from the 'console port' disease with awkwards keybindings, a lot of context-sensitive interaction also only works from very specific spots which breaks the game at times. Imagine being close to a closet ready to hide, yet the context-sensitive button won't appear because you're not in the correct spot. I've already been killed way too many times because of the poor controls.
-levels really need a much greater level of interaction for it to really 'work' as a stealth game. Especially early on when you lack basic defense against people / androids.
-one can unfortunately make a decent case for this game not having great level design
-crafting seems like an after thought and just like the levels, lack a greater depth for it to really make sense. The crafting system depth of say a Fallout 4, where almost everything and anything counts as a resource is lacking here
-FOV is incredibly small, so playing this game often feels like looking through binoculars backwards
-DLC ; there's more if you want more, but perhaps most of it should simply be part of the main game. I'm not saying the base game lacks value in terms of content, but the DLC is totally overpriced
-Android enemies are pretty much invincible it seems, now don't get me wrong the serious danger of getting killed is quite great in terms of tension, but I would have liked to see the player actually be more capable of defeating the Androids. I know a certain DLC enables that, but I think the base game needs it.

I'm going to not recommend this game, but I do have to add that fans of the franchise might be able to ignore the bigger problems this game has and still enjoy this quite a bit. In that case it's mandatory to get it at a discount, as it's not worth full price by any means in terms of polish, smooth gameplay and appearance and AI of the alien and other enemies.

For anyone who thinks the review is overly negative, I've enjoyed this game so far and would ALMOST recommend this game. At a 50% discount most people wouldn't regret getting this I'd say. But I simply think it has a lot of flaws plenty of reviews seem to ignore. I'll be playing more of this regardless, but I wouldn't get this game expecting it to be flawless. Especially the poor AI of the Alien is quite a disappointment, along with how few hiding spots the game offers, despite the game environment looking like you could hide anywhere."

It becomes very boring as most of the time you spend looking in motion detectors waiting for 30 second period where you can do something and then spending another 5 minutes waiting doing nothing.

Somehow a game released in 2014 doesn't have a checkpoint system. The only way to save progress is at the save stations, which are unbearably few and far in between, leading to situations where one will get trapped completing the same mission objectives and hearing the same dialogue over and over and over again.

The Alien's AI makes it brilliantly unpredictable, which unfortunately means it will sometimes show up and charge right towards you, or simply systematically check every nook and cranny until it finds your hiding spot, and there's realistically nothing you can do to escape either scenario. This isn't necessarily a gamebreaker in a survival horror context, but with the aforementioned save issues, this can happen utterly randomly mere feet from a save station, setting you back, once again, 10 or 15 minutes.

To add further insult, the save stations inexplicably lock you out of resaving your game after use for some time, meaning you can't even double back to a save point after making some progress towards the inevitably failed run for the next one.

I had a smile on my face exploring the initial 70's futuristic settings of the first couple of chapters. The thing that ruined it for me is when the actual alien shows up it was just no fun anymore.  I just did not want to play the game anymore after it turned into a stealth game with instant kill and having to reload at the last checkpoint losing all my progress. I can take a little trial and error gameplay, but not as much as this game wants you to do.  After the alien shows up there is no more time to stop and look around and soak in the atmosphere, instead it turned into a COD campaign where you have to keep constantly moving forward and I hate that.

Once you finally get to the part with the alien (that is if you haven't died of boredom yet) you're almost constantly blocked by humans, androids, and/or aliens who just so happen to magically know every part of the station your in and where you're trying to go. Even on medium it gets to the point where you're hiding in almost ever room just to try to get to the next room over or the next vent.

1699,1,0.3698,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","This game is largely overhyped. There's love to detail and excellent graphics (well-optimized, too!) and voice acting and authentic movies' features and allusions. But, there are a few aspects that ruin the experience for me (minor spoilers ahead!). 

First, character body animation is past century, Quake I style. Seriously.

Then, game mechanics do not come up to what you'd expect from an AAA title. I'm playing the recommended Hard difficulty.

Androids sometimes wouldn't see you even if you are in plain sight. They wouldn't check the lockers in a room but would just stare and say they know you're there. Okay, let's assume the Apollo AI is just plain dumb.

Then, stupid enough, you can escape the alien by just running BUT you can't get past certain level locations that it ""guards"". No matter how silently you move and rely on your motion detector, that is. Maybe that's just a way to make an impression of variable game difficulty.

The puzzle mini-games  are so dead simple it's unclear why include them at all. Could be better off with some hacking/unlocking progress bar. On the other hand, it's takes some time to figure out when you try tacking the puzzle for the 1st time (and it's sometimes irritating, too).

As for crafting - it's very simple but I like it so far. Maybe it was wise not to make a more elaborate system. On the other hand, the game needs it. And here's why. It would be just unnatural to see certain useful stuff lying around when you know the station's been scavenged by its own staff for quite some time.

Bottomline, it's a mediocre gameplay with good graphics and voice acting and awful character animation (except the cutscenes).

As of yet, with 10 hrs on record, I'd only recommend buying this game when it's dirt cheap.

UPD: checked a walkthrough for the Morley's Office episode, and from the comments I see I'm not the only one having trouble going any further. Completely ruins the experience and I can't even make myself start the game, as I know it won't be a pleasant or thrilling experience."

I do admit that the atmosphere is very nicely done, but the gameplay itself is unforgiving and broken. There were numerous instances where the Alien randomly popped out of nowhere and killed me without giving me a chance to run. There was also an instance where the motion detecter didn't pick up the Alien's movement and it didn't beep, but right around the corner the damn Alien was and instantly killed me. There were also several occasions where I just waited in a room without moving, yet the alien did a complete 360 around the area twice and then decided to pop into the same room that I was in and killed me. Hiding also doesn't really work well because oftentimes the alien will just keep circling the box or locker that you are hiding in, but he will never leave the area.

There really is no combat in this game, which is sad because even stealth-horror games like Clock Tower or Haunting Ground give you a chance to defend yourself. If the alien spots you, you are dead...you can't run away and shooting it with the gun doesn't do anything.  If you want  a true horror experience that requires slow and methodical movements, then try Clock Tower or Haunting Ground - Alien Isolation is just a major let down for the genre."

An outstanding first half makes the latter half of this game all the more disappointing. The building of tension leading up to your first encounter with the Xenomorph is perfectly paced, and when you are finally pitted against it, having to work yourself through the maze of the Sevastopol station while listening to the Alien stalk you through air ducts is the closest youll ever come to living the movie. Even checking email on terminals is nerve-racking as at any moment it can pounce up behind you and skewer you with its tail like a shish-kebab.

Yet still, it all falls apart in the latter half as you are tasked with the same rote ""puzzles"" over an over again. Get to Point B. To do so, unlock this keypad with the code that sits in the terminal right next to it. Pull this lever. Turn this crank. Flip this switch. Hack this terminal. I sh*t you not when I tell you that most ""boss fights"" in this game consist of pulling levers and turning cranks. Yes, Amanda is a mechanic, I get it, But so was Clark in Dead space and his tasks weren't nearly as mind gratingly repetitive.

This is a LONG game. On average a play through will take 20h and you will enjoy about 10 of them. In the last half the game is reduced to a poor man's action game, the threat of the Alien reduced to a nuisance thanks to flame throwers. Similarly, synths are quickly dispatched with head-shots by boltgun or shotgun and humans are more effectively dealt with by clobbering with a wrench than any other weapon. None of the combat is tuned enough to be actual fun, much like the instructions to flip the next switch. Perhaps by design, as this is meant to be a stealth game but in the final third act the game does not seem to know whether it wants you to stealth it or shoot it by shoving weapons and ammo into your hands.

Buy it in a sale or bundle, but know that this is really only recommendable for hardcore fans of the movies (which I am) and even so, its a stretch. More frustrating than fearsome, it feels too much like an opportunity wasted after such a great opening and initial half.

The atmosphere isn’t really anything to write home about. On that same note, I don’t care of the graphics. There isn’t much of an artistic style, more of just some colored polygons.  
The plot is completely uninteresting. Considering as the game is already based on a story, you would expect some extra work to have been put in, but it really just seems like you’re playing out the original Alien idea.

Just my take away. After 82mins I don’t think I will be playing the game further.

1714,2,0.3549,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","Everything is great except some very ugly moments: 

No jump at all, which means you are always pinned to the ground and moving around the locations will be always linear-no shortcuts, including the moments when you escape from the enemies, you just can't hop over a barrier, or pipe - you must run along until it ends. 

Very stupid linear scripts. You take an item-this triggers the crowd, you cross a line-this triggers the crowd, no matter how silent you are. AI is dumb. I'd even call it AS - Artificial Stupidity for the same reason.

Also when she meets the alien in the second cutscene SHE YEEEEEEELSSSSSS!!!!!! And the alien just bashes the ground with his tail several times near her and leaves!!! (probably he was deaf and his nose was running to smell her).

Fake footsteps sometimes are too obvious, which makes it all unplayable. It doesn't make extra impression-it ruins the spirit of a stealth game. I understand that they were trying to make it more scary this way, but, alas-nothing but maddness...

Facial motion capture is proper on the cutscenes, but when it comes on the game engine-this looks pathetic.

The story is really involving. You have to live with people that are scared like you and not let them to kill you. Too bad you can't do anything about it and persuade them to cooperate.

Now let's go to the good stuff:

Very atmospheric, strongly reflects the visual aesthetics of the original Alien movie. Decent graphics and voice acting. On the other hand, it's constantly pulling me out of the immersion. 

[list]
[*]Inconsistent tech level. They have androids that are outwardly indistinguishable from humans and can carry on fluent conversations, but the computer interfaces are all fuzzy green-on-black text? At least this one I can chalk up to emulating the source material. In 1979 those green-screen monitors were pretty high tech!
[*]Small crap on the floor that you can't move.  A lot of doors and hallways are blocked by small crates and boxes that any reasonably fit human should be able to easily move out of the way, but you can't. I understand the developers just want to make a more interesting environment, but maybe come up with a better excuse to block doors? Maybe they're welded shut. That'd even make sense on a space station that has a killer monster running around.
[*]You can't even jump or climb over the small crap on the floor. Hey, I'm completely blocked by this meter-high bench! Nope, can't climb over it. Can't just lift my foot to step on the seat.  Nope, may as well be a solid wall.
[*]Everyone, *EVERYONE* shoots on sight.  Parlay! PARLAY!  No dice. These people are stuck on a space station with a monster, you'd think at least one of them would be interested in helping the only person who has access to a ship to get them out of there.  (Okay, your new buddy Axel Exposition is interested, but he doesn't last long.)
[*]Maybe I can make a distraction...  How about these bits of scrap I've been collecting? I can toss one across the room and... Wait, no, no I can't. There's no way to throw anything.  If I want to create a distraction I have to go rewire the place to activate a speaker or light or something.
[*]It's dark. I'll just use my handy flashlight and... WTF? The batteries are dead?  The flashlight batteries last 2 minutes.  120 seconds.  There's really no excuse for that. The devs are already limiting your use of the flashlight by making it attract enemies, why put such a harsh restriction on the time as well?  Sheesh, even in 1979 flashlight batteries lasted for hours.

1729,3,0.3018,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Alright. I might rustle some jimmies by not being on the bandwagon, but I really can't recommend this title. The TL,DR version is if you're looking for a good horror expereince, try the Amnesia line instead. 


= Basics
The game is put together well. Graphics are tight, sound design is fairly excellent with surround sound headphones. 


= Mechanics problems
Controls are usually good but there are some clunky aspects. Whenever you interact with certain object types (save points, rewiring panels, terminals) you wind up locked into a multi-second animation from which you cannot cancel. If something comes up behind you it's either going to score free hits (synthetics and humans) or an insta-kill (alien).

Gameplay breaks out to combat (very limited, and usually feels anti-climactic), walking, and occasional mini-games. Mini-games take the form of ""open this panel"", ""pull this lever"", and ""hack this interface"", with several variations on each. Opening a panel, for example, might require hitting A -> Left Trigger -> down on the Left Stick, or it might be A -> both triggers -> down on both sticks, or it might be just A (to slap a button), or you might have to cut a panel off the front first. But it's still only variations on opening a door, and conveys all the thrill you think it should. 

After a couple of hours these tasks all start to feel like filler. The variety feels a bit forced, as though the devs know they shouldn't repeat /too/ much but they only have a stable of 3 tricks to pull from for any given type of action. Wanna complicate things? Let's make the player spin up a generator before they can actually open the door! This is neither fun nor was it engaging to me. 


= Pacing problems
A:I alternates between ""stressful"" moments (with appropriate music), ""stealth"" moments (where you have time to spot enemies and plan your approach), and long sections where the game becomes a walking simulator.

Sequences without the Alien feel kind of dry. Human enemies are frightening the first time you encounter them, but once you start getting weapons, they're easy to handle. For that matter, whenever there's Alien/Human overlap, dispatching human enemies is as simple as calling in your ever-present guardian devil. A simple Noisemaker will clear untold hordes of humans from a room. I mean, the Alien actually does the clearing work, but you get how this goes already. 

Stretches of the game where you're fighting synthetics is alternately frustrating (early, when you're under-armed) and boring (later, when you've got some stun baton charges, EMPs, a shotgun or bolt gun, etc). The synthetics do not move fast, are easy to avoid, and have no way to pursue you into vents. 

The bits where the Alien is on site are sometimes stressful, sometimes goofy (crouching behind a box is enough to avoid detection, and this thing rarely looks under desks for some reason), but as a direct confrontation with the Alien is an instant-death scenario, you'll wind up spending much of the early game appreciating the undersides of office furniture or the insides of lockers. The Alien likes to hang out extra-long at times, leaving you trapped with nothing to do and no way to progress. 

The game as a whole suffers from having very long corridors with generally slow motion (fast running is possible but draws too much attention to be recommended). Some parts of the game (any work in a space suit) prevents you from running or using weapons, so you already know that you're either not going to encounter enemy resistance or any you find will be handled through the game's version of quicktime events (leading to a loss of player agency). 

There are /many/ long hallways, and there are quite a few areas of forced backtracking (with none of the new-mechanics thrill that metroidvania titles bring). While I appreciate taking your time to build up a sense of scale, grandeur, or impact, making me spend 3 minutes doing nothing but walking up a long-ass staircase in a spacesuit isn't fun. 

= Story
The story is generally good though it's told in a fragmented way through terminal notes, audio logs, and brief updates from other characters you encounter. 

The last 2-3 hours of the game didn't land well in my opinion. We reach a point where I (the player) am entirely good with letting things end, but there's no choice presented, so my character moves on with a bone-headed decision that artificially extends an ending I /knew/ had to be coming. Then we go through a few long-winded sequences where ""stress"" is a product of music and bright lights rather than any real feeling of terror in the player -- scenes where the game is telling me ""Hurry! Hurry!"" but I know damn well I could sit and watch things burn for another six hours if I wanted as all the logic is scripted. The game can tell me ""you need to be frightened!"" every few minutes and blare alarms all it wants; the impact wasn't there, and the glacial end-game pacing left me feeling like I was never really getting anywhere. 

I even found the twists boring. ""Ho hum, almost made it, - oh no! something happened! Now we get to do another lengthy mission of filler tasks where we'll probably cut through a panel or two, hack some shit, and press A a few dozen more times. weee."" 

The ending of this game didn't suit me at all. I found the conclusion transparent and the ending cinematic unfulfilling. 


= Overall
I'd give this a 3/5. There were very few technical faults to speak of (some clipping issues, a rare driver crash - nothing major). This title is put together well. But I didn't feel the experience is worth the $50 asking price at all, and the prevailing memory I have of this game is feeling kind of bored at how things went. This one winds up in my ""meh"" folder."

Exellent use of the Alien franchise is an awesome thing but at the same time it feels like a curse. It takes a long time to actually see the Alien but because of the movies you know from the beginning  who the enemy is, what it looks like and how it behaves. I felt like i have to see how the thing is animated and when i did, it was like ""Nice! Well, now what?"". The sci-fi world of alien with it's old looking ""high-tech"" machines, smoke and darkness on the other hand never gets old. Moving around in the dark halls knowing that the alien is in the wents lurking is when the game scares the crap out of you. 

I liked how alien the alien is to the surroundings it is in. Sure it moves around with ease but it is totally it's own thing from the rest. This game would work with just human and android enemies. Or it would work with just the alien. When there are both enemies present it feels like playing two different sneaking games at the same time. ""I have to avoid this enemy's line of sight but do so in a way that the other enemy doesn't hear me."" Good stuff.

It is of course for the sake of it being a game and you playing the protagonist that the alien spends a lot of time around you. That does get really repetetive after a while especially since you know that Sevastopol is a large station and that there are other humans who are not staying nearly as silent as you are. Go bother someone else for a change!

After you meet the Alien and get killed a few times the actual scariness almost gone. First of all the alien moves in a bit weird fashion. It's like the AI is making calculations of what to do next but the animation cannot always adjust to it. Sometimes it just changes directions without any sense of weight or drops down from a vent and immediately climbs back up. It might also come so close to whatever closet you are hiding in that it's head comes through the door. The Alien is an amazing piece of AI, animation and art but the less you see of it the better. Playing is still extremely intense  because you can only save at savepoints which are far apart. The Alien is really unpredicable and so any extra noise, mistake or just randomness can erase 15 minutes worth of gameplay. The thought of that is scarier than actually getting killed since you can choose if you want to see the death or not: You can always hammer the esc key faster than the Alien can kill you.

Alien: Isolation is set up to do one thing in one specific universe and it succeeds almost flawlessly. Graphics, atmosphere, sound, and everything else is really good. Was it a good Alien experience? Yes! No other game even comes close. 

Was it a good gameplay experience? I'm not so sure about that. Sneaking in a new area  for the first time is great but 2nd and 3rd attempts are really tedious. Much worse than any other sneaking game. It feels like you can't ""earn"" freedom from the Alien. No matter how sneaky you are or how close call you escaped, it will be back in two seconds. It will force you into same closet 4 times for no apparent reason before you get to another room and repeat. It doesn't take long to learn the noises it makes and think ""Not this crap again"". 

If the Alien were a creature that tried to hunt, eat and survive and you only saw it few times then Alien: Isolation would be the best thing ever. Unfortunately it is a creature that tries to entertain and serve a plot and does so way too often. There is a mod that disables the Alien AI. Around the 5 hour mark you understand why someone made it.

In the end it comes to two questions. Are you the kind of person who doesn't mind leaving a game unfinished and is the price right for 3-4 hours of entertainment? If you say yes to both, then get Alien: Isolation! Those few hours will be awesome!"

Reminder: This is the same title that was awarded to Half Life 2, and Skyrim. 

Spawn errors. Map loading errors. Alien getting stuck on doorframes and doing a shimmy shake dance in mid-air. Enemies can't follow you into vents. Androids are scarier than the Alien because they can't be scared off like a frightened deer because you made a loud noise or shot some fire at it. 

A game which is barely held together with twine and chewing gum, where the atmosphere is constantly killed dead by loading issues, bugs, and of course magical floating motion trackers. Where the Alien in ""Alien Isolation"" has only ever killed me once, but getting my character model stuck on an opening door and pansily slapped to death by robots has killed me more times than I can count. 

This is what you deem the best game made this year. I can practically hear the money changing hands, Sega. It's disgusting."

1746,3,0.2885,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","While the setting is faithful to the original Alien movies, the gameplay is sadly not that great. The pattern the gameplay follows is this: get to some objective -> find out power is out -> turn power back on -> hack or turn on some other subsystems; it reminded me of Doorman: Absolution
This type of pattern is used at least on 5 occasions.

Other times the gameplay follows a style of: get to location A -> find out location A is not reachable via original path -> new objective is to find alternative path via B, all the while being chased by the Alien. 
While it is fun for a few hours, this routine which makes up the entire gameplay, gets old after it is used time and time again. 

Lastly, basic science accuracy is completely ignored - Sevastopol, the space station on which most of the gameplay takes place, has perfect Earth gravity, although it is in an orbit around a gas giant where there should be none. How this is possible is not properly explained throughout the game (and the station does not rotate to generate centrifugal force either). Even spacewalks feature Ripley stolling on metallic bridges without the least hint of trying to resist zero gravity. Even if you assume the space suit has some magnets in the boots that keeps it fixed to the metallic bridges during spacewalks, it still makes no sense aliens can walk around the outside like there's full gravity...
Completely unappealing for someone used to the kind of attention to detail as in Mass Effect

If faithfully capturing and recreating the first Alien movie's look and feel were enough to make a good game, this game would be no less than fantastic. Sadly, a game and a compelling story need more than that - interesting characters worth caring about, and six letters: PACING. 

The formula ""activate X, oh no, access to X is blocked by Y, you need to get a Z to get there, oh shit, the Z is supposed to be in the A, but someone took it to B and to get there you need to get rid of C"" is compelling once or twice, but if the whole game consists of setbacks, it gets old and tedious. The same can be said for a Ripley crashing through the floor and losing progress / being diverted: For god's sakes, it can be done once, or twice, but do it more often and players become incredibly fatigued about something that is supposed to be HORROR.

About the gadgets: I very much liked the idea of plasma torches and Security Access Tuners. but to have actually three levels of them just becomes repetitive, as well as having to re-start generators and all that - all of the stuff looks great, but simply is used to often. Why? I don't know, perhaps to give the game some additional length? I honestly prefer playing a three-hour game that has my interest for the whole three hours, than having to push myself through a seven-hour-deal of repetition with little variety.

The worst thing however is this: A game that is so unforgiving for every little mistake should either auto-save on every corner or GIVE PLAYERS THE ABILITY TO SAVE ANYWHERE, ANYTIME. Yes, I understand that the concept of manual Quicksave is alien (hah) on console games, and their progresskeeping mechanics swap over to PC games as well nowadays, and yes I understand the argument that it would break the sense of risk and fear. But I really can't afford having to repeat 20 minutes of gameplay again and again just because there is no save point between here and there. 

It simply all adds to the frustation with this game which could have been so much, but all the beauty it offers is swallowed up by all the repetition you have to suffer through for various reasons."

1754,3,0.3781,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Great respect for the source material, setting, atmosphere, and audio are not enough to save Alien: Isolation from being a broken mess.

The controls are often unresponsive, the interface is mediocre (and obtrusive), the save system -- okay, wait. I actually like the idea behind it, but I had to replay the entirety of four different missions multiple times due to a loading loop error. Each time, I was able to get things back on track aside from the final level (mission 19) where the game inexplicably stuck a dead body at Ripley's feet. I would have had to replay mission 18 again to hopefully solve this problem, and it would've taken a lot of money for me to ever play that one again. Or mission 17. Or mission 16. Or...

If you're wondering how I racked up the final achievements despite being unable to move, I had to download someone else's save just so I could complete my game. Utter nonsense.

Oh how I wish this was the only bug in the game. It isn't. Not by a longshot. It merely is the most crippling and, literally, game-breaking of them all.

The pacing and actual gameplay have too much of a negative effect to recommend Alien: Isolation. Maybe if it was much shorter, tighter, had less to collect and, rather, had a stronger emphasis on weaving a compelling narrative, and... oh, yeah, it didn't keep eating my damn saves, I'd probably have enjoyed my experience.

If it wasn't for the save issue, I *may* have marked this as a recommended title (to be purchased only during a 75% sale), but honestly, watching Alien 10 times in a row would've been less tedious and monotonous than playing Alien: Isolation.

I guess there's a reason why this developer typically makes RTS games rather than these types. Stick to what you're good at, Creative Assembly. From what I've briefly experienced, you are quite good at strategy titles. Please leave Alien: Isolation II (Aliens: Isolation?) to another team.

I really wanted to love this game. I really did. Why else would I have spent 5-6 hours fiddling with saves, verifying files, replaying the same missions over again, and even resorting to other people's saves if I didn't? Unfortunately... well, you (possibly) read the review.

Hopefully you, if you choose to ignore my warnings, have better luck."
1755,3,0.4558,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Was not what I expected

+ Graphics are beautiful and art design looks great and captures the look of the Alien movie very well.

-Music is by default way too loud when you are trying to hear your enemy in a stealth game.
The stealth system seems unfair, unbalanced, like the player is dropped into an FPS with no weapons. 
The manual save system leaves one wishing there were auto saves at key points to lose less progress.
These things combined make for a very frustrating gameplay experience.

I recommend playing Soma for a great horror/exploration game.

But here… this thing is locked on to Ripley 24/7 for some reason when the game feels like it and off duty when the game says so.
I don’t mind being the helpless one and then need to hide. But this is a 20 hour game where you have to do this over and over and over again… or just blast the damn thing with your flamethrower. 

Look the Alien itself is dumb as a door and they knew this. So the only way to make it work… was to chain the damn thing to your butt. It will not give a DAMN about other survivors on the station if YOU are nearby (unless the script said so). This feels lazy and makes no sense. I know the hardcore crow will say I’m a scared.

Pros:
-	Great atmosphere, sound and graphic
-	First 5 hours of the game is great and keeps you paranoid
-	Voice acting is well done 

Cons:
-	Repetitive gameplay and backtracking makes 20 hours hard unless you are very patience
-	Story is nothing new and you might as well just watch the first movie
-	The A.I is rock solid stupid

1766,3,0.6123,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I can't recommend this game, and I say this with a heavy heart and plenty of guilt. Let me be clear, it is an absolutely brilliant game. No other game has kept me at the edge of my seat as much as this (with the possible exception of Tomb Raider). The thing is, while many of you may love it, it's just not my kind of game. Now let me explain myself so you can decide whether you want this game; which, if you're the kind of gamer like me, you won't.

The kind of games I loved: Call of Juarez Gun Slinger, Bioshock, FarCry, Tomb Raider, Metro (2033 and Last Light), Dishonoured. What do they have in common? You can kill stuff! And in some cases (Call of Juarez and FarCry) it's quite satisfying to do so. There are games like Alien Isolation where you're the prey rather than the hunter (Tomb Raider, Metro), but in Tomb Raider and Metro, you can still kill stuff, which makes you feel much less helpless. Don't get me wrong, I'm not the violent kind of gamer (I've never killed a living soul in Dishonoured unless the game storyline dictated), but what ruins the gaming experience in Alien Isolation is not just that you can't kill the Alien, it's that much of the time when you die, you feel that it's not your fault! Sometimes the Alien will just turn up in your face for no reason at all, and you have to restart all the way from the last save point ages ago (OK, maybe like 10 minutes ago, but that's ages). Furthermore, you can't help but feel really lonely (which I also felt in Metro), which I don't like. I don't mind scary stuff, I love a good jump-scare in fact! But it's the loneliness that really gets to me.

Final verdict. You may love this game. But it won't give you the warmth of a escapist world like FarCry or Just Cause 2 or Trine 2, nor the comfort of constant conversation and company like Bioshock Infinite, nor the satisfaction of shooting and killing stuff like Call of Juarez, nor the feelings of accomplishment you get from stealth-killer games like FarCry and Splinter Cell. However it will scare the shit out of you, it will keep you on your toes at all times, and it has a hell of a good storyline like Tomb Raider (but doesn't quite compare up to the great Tomb Raider, in my opinion)."

And game's most climactic cutscene looks like slightly animated concept art leftovers.
As for store 'screenshots' – don't expect to see that neat depth of field effect during gameplay.

Sophisticated alien behaviour is another example of marketing BS this game owes most of it's hype to. The creature just follows you on an invisible leash while pretending not to know where you are. Then it retreats into a ceiling vent so you can stop kiting it around a table and continue with your chores - backtracking to kickstart yet another emergency power generator.

Storytelling by means of scattered notes fails when you get backstabbed while reading.
Especially when your lost progress includes tedious inventory management via an UI ported from console version as-is. Actually, my #1 cause of death wasn't some gameplay challenge, but that godawful radial menu designed for analog sticks and making no sence when mindlessly mapped to a mouse input.

But my main grudge is the ending. [strike]Boss fight[/strike]... [strike]final standoff[/strike]... thing before credits is a fucking QTE. And then, the narrative doesn't have any sort of conclusion, it just cuts ambiguisly to black, followed by some sequel-bait crap. So much for a story about a person seeking closure.

[h1] Story [/h1] 
The story of Alien: Isolation is cliche throughout the entire game, but this is exactly what I expected and wanted as an Alien fan. You play as Amanda Ripley, Ellen's daughter to find out what exactly happened to your mother 15 years ago. She was promised that she would see her on her 11th birthday and never saw her again. And so your journey begins. The rest you should find and figure out.

[h1] Graphics and sound [/h1]
Like a lot of people will tell you, it's best to have a good sound system or headphones. The sounds are top notch and it gets your adrenaline pumping hearing even the softest hisses from doors opening and closing to the hissing and thumping of the dreaded Xenomorph. The lighting is some of the best I've ever seen in any game and pops out more than anything else (other than the smoke). 

[h1] Mechanics [/h1]
The Xenomorph AI is one of the most impressive AI systems I've ever seen. No two encounters are ever the same. Sometimes she's relentless, sometimes you won't even see her in an area. Sometimes she's loud and sloppy, sometimes she gets you before you even know what the hell happened. This isn't like any horror game you've played where it's obvious if you've been seen or not. The AI is smart enough to make it vague at times, pretending it didn't see you or pretending it did to make you panic. The alien is very unpredictable and makes for one hell of a ride. Survivors are just downright broken. Unless you're behind clear cover, they do not miss. Last time I checked, fear makes you inaccurate at long range. Working Joes are nothing but irritating, nearly impossible to melee and you'll be seeing and fighting them more than the Xenomorph and survivors combined. Or that's how it felt for me.

[h1] Overall [/h1]
Alien: Isolation is worth the purchase and for the first 5 hours or so you will be awed by its morbid beauty. After that, it's a very tedious mess of running back and forth restarting generators, hacking (which is actually fun) trying to find ways to open doors and hiding anywhere you can for 5-15 minutes at a time. Slight spoiler: [spoiler] While I understand why the ending happened, more closure would've been much nicer. I was very irritated by it. [/spoiler]"
1772,1,0.5723,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","This is a stealth game. Not a horror game. Tedium aside, my biggest gripe with this game lies in the behaviour of the AI. It enters the same hallways and rooms when you do, it leaves when you do, even when it has no reason to believe you're there. It is perfectly content to waste all its time and attention lingering around you because the devs wanted the alien to be FOCUSED on you. And this is what kills the game for me, because it no longer feels like it's a scary, believable scenario and in the back of my mind, I know the only reason the alien is still here in this area with me and camping the hallway I need to go through is because the invisible hand of the devs said so. 

No matter how deceptive or sneaky I am, no matter how much I try to blockade the path behind me, the alien will be magically moved to the next area with me. If you trick the alien into a sealed room, he teleports. If you get on a tram and move to the other side of the station, he'll be back sooner than you know it. If you hide in a locker, the alien that was previous patroling back and forth will now deliberately pass in front of you a few times, excessively posturing as dictated by the devs, even though it has no reason to believe you're there. It's not dramatic, it just reminds you you're playing a video game.

That said, the rest of the game is fantastic. And after a while, you're given enough access to the tools you need to displace that annoying, camping alien (flamethrower, molotov, pipebombs), and the alien actually GOES AWAY. What a difference it makes, when you can actually explore the rooms (as long as you're walking) and immerse yourself. The game really picks up after the first third or so, I guess when the devs realised they could stop flaunting the alien garishly.

Edit: It'd be nice if the game actually told you how some things worked. Hacking minigames arent explained, but once you figure it out, they're braindead easy. The motion tracker has a bar that doesn't point you towards your objective, but rather towards the path of your objective. It also displays a number in the corner from 0-1.0 that represents range to closest target, so you know if targets are approaching or retreating from you, even if you are not facing them. And don't try to be too cautious otherwise you'll miss your window of escape. Taking risks is a lot easier than being too slow and safe and if you get into trouble, crouching behind any corner or boxes or a low desk is enough, and there are plenty of supplies for crafting so don't try to save your molotovs/noisemakers."

It's open world you say - no it isn't, barriers like waist high banisters prevent it from being open world, I can't actually climb over something that a person does climb over so room furniture forms impentrable barriers you have to go around. It's incredibly buggy. Accidentaly get a flare in your hand? You're screwed... you can't even put items away you are carrying in what must be one of the most glaring game oversights in a major title.

I don't expect to swing from the ceiling like the Akrham or Assains's Creed games but a little bit of movement realism would be nice. There's nothing like spending a minute just having to walk over a massive room because you can't shin over a banister to the floor next to you.

Maybe, if you are lucky you will see the alien. I've been playing it for over two hours, haven't died, and have seen a glimpse of an alien once. That's it?!?!?!?

1784,1,0.6135,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","---Review after putting the game down---
Not worth finishing.  For a game entirely based on stealth, the mechanics are garbage.  You can be detected from multiple hallways away from an enemy who will proceed to insta-kill you as well as be undected by an enemy who is actually standing on top of you while you're crouch in an open room with no cover.  This is a series of try and repeat until you get the timing right for each area and the game decides to accept your attempt.  Rolling dice would give you more control over the outcome.  I eventually put the entire thing down once I stopped caring about the character, any objective, and the environment just became annoying.

--- Original review below from early into gameplay----
It was interesting how they still managed to make all the screens and tech look like they're still straight out of the 1980s, and the game play itself is very nerve wracking, but it leaves a lot to be desired; primarily in the detection mechanic. The game swings widly from one end of the spectrum from the other as to whether or not an alien detects you.  Some days he'll know exactly where you are and kill you from across several hallways regardless of if you lock the door or not (locking doors takes FAR too long).  Other days, and I can't explain how hard I laughed at this when it happened, you can be sitting in the corner of a room with the alien in it and absolutely no covereage to hide behind, have the alien walk up to you, trip over your feet, stop on top of you, turn around twice, and walk away again.

Really, the game is scary, but it just gets so damn tedious with how often you will need to reload and replay almost every single area."

1787,1,0.5791,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","One of the most repetitive and frustrating games I think I've ever experienced. By the time you've played it for an hour you've genuinely seen virtually everything it has to offer. There's nothing new in any of the later levels and I wish I'd just stopped playing instead of slogging through to the end. 

The alien makes things quite tense at first, but it rapidly becomes ridiculous as you realise it must be virtually omniscient to be able to follow you all over this huge space station - lifts and rapid transit systems apparently don't cause it any trouble for example. It and later the other aliens seem capable of tracking you flawlessly wherever you go, employing what must be the most extensive system of overly large air vents in human history. Having to crawl slowly around the vast majority of the time just so an alien doesn't pop out of a vent and grab you every 7 seconds really helps to artificially increase the play time of the game. Similarly the EVA sections are extremely tedious because you move so slowly and are given long distances to walk for no apparent reason. Once you get hold of a flamethrower, it's a waste of time trying to hide from the alien if you do encounter it - a couple of bursts of flame and it'll scurry off into a vent (there's always a vent within a few metres), removing most of the intended suspense and threat. 

Aside from the boring ""stealth"" parts, the game is just a constant stream of ""Go to place X and pull lever Y"" missions. You can explore a bit if you want sometimes, but there's not much incentive to do so when you have a checkpoint save system and the chance of dying almost anywhere and at any time depending on where the alien decides to pop out next.

The game also features some of my least favourite FPS cliches, such as forcing you to give up all your weapons at one point, scripted scenes where you're just a passenger being told to press a key occasionally, multiple instances of dangling from a ladder over a long drop of some sort, taking you back to levels you've already seen earlier, and your character surviving all kinds of falls and explosions and other hazards that would have killed a normal person. One section towards the end I remember as being an example of the worst type of level design went something like this: 1) sneak through a series of rooms to find a keycard 2) sneak back through the same rooms to another set of rooms and use the keycard to unlock a door 3) try to open the door, but a generator stops working 4) sneak back through all the same rooms once again to restart the generator 5) sneak back through all the rooms one final time to get to the door again. It's so so so boring. 

I can't think of any reason why I'd ever want to play this game again. For all its flaws, I'd rather play Colonial Marines."

Sneak over here, grab this thing, open this door, now fix this, ect. ect. It's part Bioshock, part Dead Space, but to be honest Bioshock was more entertaining to play and Dead Space was far more intense and scary. 

For me, the game consisted of sneaking through the same vents in the same reused areas for some new tool that will open the next vent to the next area that looks a lot like the last. While Alien: Isolation does look and sound great, the ""game"" itself is pretty standard hide and seek with a few gadgets thrown in.

- Graphics are good
- Runs well (mostly)
- Environments are very detailed
- Does a good job of creating tense atmospheres
- Recreates the old sci-fi look-and-feel

However, after you get the flamethrower the game unfortunately goes downhill fast.
- Alien is no longer really a threat, just spritz it and it runs away
- Androids and humans are still as dumb and easy to outsmart as they were before
- Puzzles get very repetitive
- There's a lot of backtracking
- Entire sections where nothing really happens and you just walk to your objective, flip a switch and walk back

I never found it to be scary, it was more of a tense experience; giving the player an overpowered weapon with which to destroy the main enemy completely removes any tension and basically lets you run around with no sense of danger. The game does try and remedy this by making puzzles with various enemy types, but pretty much all of these situations can be bypassed by throwing noisemakers.

1798,1,0.3982,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","The Alien franchise hasn't had very much luck in gaming lately, between Aliens vs Predator and Aliens: Colonial Marines both turning out pretty lackluster to say the least. Alien: Isolation barely had to do much more than exist in order to be the best game the franchise has had for several years, and in that regard it accomplished its goal. But it also has its own fair share of problems, unfortunately.

The biggest issue is that while the game is called ""Alien: Isolation"", you're not really isolated, and the alien isn't really there that often. When I went back and replayed the game game a second time I used a stopwatch to keep track of just how often the alien was actually hunting me, and it came out to be 1 hour, 36 minutes, and 34 seconds. Now, this number was only tracking the amount of time that the alien is forcefully encountered, and there are at least a few hours of areas where if you make too much noise it's possible to summon him, but I didn't count those because as long as you crouch instead of running around banging on everything you see he'll never show up in those areas. If this were a 4 hour indie game that would be a fair number, and I'd even accept it if the game had puzzles or something to fill the rest of the game. But even knowing where to go, the game still took me around 15 hours to replay, and most of the rest of that time is filled with stealth segments with humans and androids.

Let's start by describing the androids. The androids are used pretty frequently throughout the later parts of the game, and at one point take up 3 chapters in a row where the alien is nowhere to be seen. It's hard to even consider them a threat, though, because all they do is slowly walk towards you, and if they manage to catch you you can just do a QTE button mash to escape their grasp up to two times times before actually dying on the third (this is on Nightmare difficulty, so it might be even easier on lesser difficulties). But the ""if"" is a big ""if"" there, because while they were presumably trying to capture the feeling of an unstoppable robot slowly but relentlessly pursuing you like you might see in a movie like The Terminator, they left out the whole ""relentlessly"" part, and all you have to do to evade them is just run past them and go around a corner until they lose you. The only way I could see someone dying to one of them is if they panic and run so far that they end up looping around and running back into the same android they were running from.

Secondly, we move on to the humans. The humans have guns, and aren't afraid to use them - the loading screens try to convince you that they won't mess with you if you don't mess with them, implying that maybe at one point the game had a mechanic like in I Am Alive where you can negotiate with survivors and interact with them, but it's a lie; all the humans know how to do is walk and shoot. The thing is, the humans aren't very bright, and don't have very good survival instincts, so you can do things like this. http://puu.sh/jMilq/d76226ebb9.webm. Flares are essentially the only item you need to get past any group of humans, because once they see one they all bunch up and run towards it like a bunch of moths. But later on you don't even need any flares, because you can just do this. http://puu.sh/jMv0K/e051338fcb.webm (for the record, this doesn't count as killing them yourself either, which is why I have the achievement for completing the game without killing any humans). Even though everyone knows there's an alien on board, they have no qualms opening fire the moment they get the chance to, and then you can just hide until the alien kills them all and leaves. They also have infinite ammo, and it's a good thing, because they don't really know how to conserve it well. http://puu.sh/jNolO/65e320f1b8.webm 

But what about the Alien itself? Surely that one hour and 36 minutes must be great, right? Well, usually, but not always. Once again, I'll let the webms do some of the talking. The big problem is that the alien isn't necessarily stupid so much as completely schizophrenic, so you'll see things like this pretty commonly http://puu.sh/jMqYl/87b2a12968.webm where the alien will start walking into a room and then immediately remember he left the oven on in another area and turn around, or this http://puu.sh/jMr1G/d91111028e.webm where the alien just seems like he's lost, or someone less commonly things like this http://puu.sh/jMzMq/37369a8cba.webm or this http://puu.sh/jNFNP/a8f59da2c4.webm . The alien could be controlled by Twitch Plays Pokemon and I wouldn't be able to tell any difference, because its movements are just completely random. Instead of feeling like a deadly predator it just feels like an old man looking for his car keys, and the only way he'll ever catch you is by pure chance, such as him deciding to do a 180 turn for no reason when you're trying to sneak past him. Thankfully the craftable noisemakers have the same effect with him as the flares do with humans, so he isn't much of a threat either.

It's really a shame, because you can tell the developers really put a lot of effort into the rest of the game. The visual and sound design is fantastic, and everything looks and sounds like you're straight in an Alien movie. The graphics are fantastic, and the game is equally well optimized. The story is pretty much just a typical Alien story, but it's still fun to see, at least the first time. And the game even has rough Oculus Rift support, which even I have to admit is pretty terrifying compared to playing the game normally. But even though the game does a great job of building tension and atmosphere when you're alone, it all goes to hell when you're around any enemy because of just how stupid everything is. The game plays like a stealth game with half the game code missing, and while I think a hardcore Alien fan might be able to appreciate the rest of the game enough to enjoy the game anyways, if you're just looking for a survival horror game there are way too many better options that don't cost $50 for me to recommend this one. I'd love to see them make a second game using the same groundwork but with improved pacing and AI, but I just didn't enjoy this game very much. It might make a good Holiday Sale purchase, though.

If you do choose to buy the game at some point, I would strongly recommend playing on either Hard or Nightmare (the game warns you before starting Nightmare, but it's still pretty easy). I played through it the first time on Hard and found myself flooded with so many crafting resources that I constantly found myself crafting useless trash like flashbombs that I knew I would never use just to make room in my inventory for more crafting ingredients, which doesn't really strike me as ""survival horror"". Nightmare fixes that by veering off to the opposite end and making 99% of the containers in the game empty, which at least makes it feel like the items you do manage to find are special even if you probably won't use them since all you ever need are flares and noisemakers. Nightmare also breaks your motion detector and makes it give false readings sometimes, making it less slightly more challenging to sneak past the enemies (which is a much needed addition, in my opinion)."

I have all the movies and can't count anymore how many times I've watched them. This appeared to be the first really good Alien game. And it definitely could be. The first few hours I loved it. But then the game slipped extremely close past perfection right into my ""games, I will never finish""-corner. 

-Spoiler-
How the game should be imo: 
The Alien appears. You manage to not get noticed. You hide for some time. After a while the Alien goes away to search other areas of the space station. You have some time to do your stuff. After a while it comes back (maybe sooner, maybe later, maybe much later) and you need to hide again.

How it actually is:
The Alien appears. You manage to not get noticed. You hide for some time. The Alien will lurk around the same, small area, making its rounds forever. When you leave your hiding place, you need to rush to the next one, as the Alien will walk by just a few seconds later. If you stay in the hideout, it will find you eventually. Every time it walks by, you have a random chance that it inspects the hideout. Then you need to hold your breath and lean back, where you have another random chance to not get caugt.
It's all about exact timing and luck. It's much too random and there is not enough room to make this whole thing interesting.
The worst thing is that the game never gives you a hint what the ""proper way"" is. I often had no idea what i'm supposed to do. When I managed to escapte the Alien, it felt mostly like mere luck, or that the ai had some glitch. 

The game builds up a solid atmosphere in the first hours. But as soon as you encounter the Alien for the first time, it will never leave your side ever again. There are many survivors on the station, yet it's focused only on you. It attacks other people only if it's part of the story or if they stay directly in its line towards you. 

It seems that it can smell or hear you from miles away somehow. But when it has found the general area where you are, it suddenly can't smell or hear you anymore, even from a few feet away. Yet it seems to know for sure that you are somewhere around. No matter how silent you were before. And it won't leave the area until you leave. 

It's completely scripted. The Alien never freely walks around the station. It's always where you are.
There are 2 states.
First you can only hear it. (it never comes out, no matter how long you wait) 
Then it comes out at a specific point. (and never goes away).

It could be one of my favourite games. It's extremely close to the first movie. The graphics are great. The atmosphere is intense. The sound effects are one of the best i've heard. I like the Idea that there are also other dangers, such as desperate survivors or malfunctioning androids. 
But the Alien is way over the top. 
It suddenly changes - what has started as an exciting horror/surival-Adventure - into an annoying hide & seek orgy.
-Spoiler end-

Having to repeat 5, 10 and 20 minute parts over and over (even if you use the save points as much as possible) is no fun anymore at some point. A game should be a challenge. You need to fail sometimes to keep a game interesting. But there is a thin line between fun and frustration. For me it has exceeded this line greatly. 

Just my point of view. It could be a 10/10 game for you."
1801,3,0.4153,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","A lot of the atmosphere and graphics are really well researched and executed, the major problem is that the game is no fun to play.  All the annoying little quick time events from the relatively complex like hacking to the mundane like opening a door really take away from the flow of the game.

You frequently lose control as a cut scene takes over to try to emphasise some plot point.  Again this just breaks the flow, and is particualarly annoying if you are repeating an area.

The worst thing is that the puzzles are punishingly esoteric to the point where the game becomes pure trial and error, which coupled with how unfun it is to just exist in this game makes me simply not want to play it.

The designers really ought to have done their homework and looked at games like Bioshock to see how to do the genre right."

All in all I'm glad I finished it (using a trainer) but it's definitely not a game I will replay or recommend to anyone.

Gorgeous game art, some of the best sci-fi game art I've seen, & oh so faithful to the original Alien film.
Very well optimized- Looks fantastic, and I managed to run it on my aging system with everything cranked to full.
Fantastic sound, some awesome ambient music tracks either directly ripped from the original film, or recreated so faithfully that it's impossible to differentiate.

Cons:

The gameplay.

This was basically the reason I would rate this game a 5/10.

Some of *THE* worst gameplay I have ever had to slog myself through- and the only reason I did so was to continue admiring the awesome work of the art departments. (music/sound included).

The 5 points out of ten I give it are solely based on the artwork. If i were rating it solely on that basis, and ignoring the fact that it is supposed to be an interactive experience where you have fun...? ...well then it would be a ten. 

However, it's *supposed* to be a video game, and not simply an interactive Xenomorph-in-your-grill-em-up.

After around 10 hours on the hardest difficulty, I decided to reduce it to medium, as the utter tedium of waiting around for the Xenomorph to do his thing and fuck off outta my way so I could progress, finally got to me and I could take it no more.

After another 4 hours, I reduced it all the way to novice, just so I could see the end of this miserable pile of beautifully rendered dogshit.

Honestly, If game design had the same ability to be scrutinized as immediately as game art does... then this game would easily have been a massive bomb.

It's a real shame because what could've been an incredible survival/puzzler just wound up being a fucking crouch from start to finish simulator.

The first encounter with the Alien was pretty frightening and action packed, but after seeing the fucking thing the next 10-20 times running around it becomes stupid. What's even more stupid is that you can't damage the Alien at all besides scaring him away with molotov cocktails, a flamethrower, or pipe bomb; but only for a short while. I thought maybe blasting him in the leg with a .357 magnum would cripple it by making it slower, NOPE! Bullets just bounce off it.

After multiple encounters with the alien, and some being straight up dumb, I shudder at thinking how the game is at the higher difficulties.

The level design is hit and miss, some areas have a good area to move around in and hide while other areas are scant. There is a TON of backtracking in the game, this is somewhat annoying.

The story I didn't pay attention to at all, but basically the missions involve finding item XYZ, activating system XYZ, then leaving area XYZ. All this happens while evading the alien that will walk around the station impervious to damage.

If the developers made a sequel, I would recommend to them that the Alien be damaged by weapons, and have encounters be more rare to keep the fright factor up."
1810,1,0.6621,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","The game has a lot going for it visually, and does a very competent job of setting tension through details. However I was only able to get 4 or 5 chapters in before I was annoyed into quitting. The game had devolved into one long stealth mission. Which can be good when done right, I loved the Thief and Hitman franchises and the accomplishment of working through your surroundings to accomplish your goals. But in Alien there really wasn't much to DO other than creep from one side of the room to the other to go to the next macguffin. By the time I quit, the opponents were cyborgs and the namesake Alien.

Cyborgs are slow and slow-witted, more an annoyance than a proper enemy. I spent a lot of time sneaking past them, but realized it's just more effective to run past them and get to your objective. They have very uneven levels of intelligence, sometimes you can duck under an open table and they can't find you sitting right in front of them, sometimes you can hide inside of a closet after losing them around several turns and they just b-line straight to your closet, open it up then beat you. Just... so annoying and dumb. So maybe I'll try and take one out? Oh, I unloaded all six shots of this revolver into your face and it didn't matter? That's great. Why do they even give you the pretence of holding a weapon?

Then there's the Alien. Once he joins in, the never-ending stealth mission now has frequent random losses where he appears from nothing and stabs you for instant death. So you end up creeping along very slowly to make less noise which helps a small amount, except now you're moving so slowly he'll just wander over you and kill you because apparently he wants to kill you more than everyone else combined. So it's a slower, more boring death that takes way more time to get to. Despite the hugeness of the station there's never a moment where this #*(@ is more than a room or two away from you. Why is he camping my character specifically? How is he able to always be around me even if he can't find me while sitting under a desk the same room? Do I have some sort of Ripley connection to the monster that makes him so much more interested in me than everyone else? What was I supposed to know to avoid these obnoxious instant lose surprises? Why do all doors open automatically if you're on their half of the room, announcing to the Alien that here you are, please kill me now? How is any of this avoided? How long does it take for him to leave a room when you're hiding in a locker? 5 minutes? 10? He just endlessly keeps pacing back and forth in front of you, prolonging this failed attempt.... ugh.

So between dumb, slow and pointless or dumb, fast, magnetically attracted to your location and instantly game ending, the enemies are not satisfying to work against. Tension gives way to frustration which gives way to annoyance. Plus the game ONLY saves when you specifically go to a save terminal. You will have all your progress rewound to the previous zone if they don't give you a save point in a sensible location before your next alien one shot death. If I had to describe this game in one word, it would be ""annoying"". Lots of potential, lots of atmosphere, but the game just isn't fun or satisfying to play."

It's all the more dissapointing, cos I can tell that the developers have put so much work into the game. I hate to dismiss all of that labour and passion. But my experience of the game has been really poor because of the dead-end, innavigable map at the very start of the game.

It's easily noticable how much attention and love the developers have put into it. If you want to feel yourself ""playing"" the first Alien back in 1979-this is great for it. Unfortunately the game suffers from some serious problems. First of all, there are bugs, a lot of them, the game is not so well optimized. For example, starting at some point, your attempt to load the last saved game will cause the game to freeze, you gonna have to restart it over and over again. Considering that you gonna die a lot, and believe me, you will, this is a serious problem that will probably drive you nuts, so a lot of nerves are gonna be wasted. Second, there are some very weird design decisions going on in this game. I have no idea, whos idea it was that you can't just pick up a gun from the first dead body you make, because you are only supposed to find your first firearm in a specific place... That's just really weird, personally i don't understand things like that. No stealth kills, which is weird too for a game like that, the Alien itself is immortal, can't be killed with anything, even a flamethrower, even a bomb that will kill androids... Now spoiler, after all the hiding, dying, surviving, all the wasted nerves, you don't even get the satisfaction of killing the Alien, yes, you won't be seeing the fucker that unpunishably bothered you so much being blown up, squashed, pressurized, burned or destroyed any other way, so don't expect to be treated. That's really disappointing. Safe stations sometimes are very far from one another, especially it's frustrating when you have done a lot since the last time you saved, then you die and must go all that long way again. The Alien itself might seem to be ""cheating"". It always knows where you are, always stalks the area where you are in; it can often appear from a vent right in front of you for no reason. A lot of backtracking, 1 really really really plain stupid achievement. In general, a great game for Alien fans that is unfortunately ruined by a lot of fatal bugs and glitches that sometimes can make the playing process literally unbearable, debatable and sometimes just unlogical gesign decisions and lots of unnecessary backtracking.

Too much like a scripted moving where I was just along for the ride and my decisions meant nothing. The art was amazing, the sound was good too if a bit loud.

After completing the game, I have to say I love the story. Finally, a new story line that doesnt involve the evil Wayland Yutani Corporation.  The addition of the Seegson Corp is a great addition, and brings to life the very repetitive ""Aliens vs Predators"" Franchise. 

The survivor reactions in ""Alien: Isolation"" feel real. Each survivor is trying to stay alive in his/her own way, from shell shock to meanacing and looting. Although, the Sevestapol surivors decisions may seem deplorable, they are relatable. I wonder, myself, if I would horde the remaining resources only to survive a few days longer.

Even though most of the game is spent alone, you don't feel lonely. Either you are witnessing other survivors scraping by, or retrace the events through computer logs and recorded messages. 

The game develops a true sense of dread, which I most commend it upon. However, not in the traditional sense of a video game. The story is great, but the difficulty is terrible. I stand by my original review. 

I think quartertothree.com review nails the hammer on the head about the difficulty. ""At which point you reload and replay your way to that point again. There is nothing scary about a videogame when the stakes are so low. That’s not horror. That’s tedium. Alien: Reloading.""

END EDIT

I find this game very repetitive and frustrating. I was hoping for an adventure/horror game like ""Outlast"", but with the Alien lore. 

I find it very difficult to get immersed in the game due to the uncanny nature of the Alien. The Alien seems to stalk relentlessly, even if their are other NPC humans near by.  The hours that I have played, have been spent stuffed in lockers or under desks....  My attempts to immerse myself in the computer logs or simply adventuring are thwarted by the Alien... I would love to get wrapped up in the Alien lore, but its often cut short by either a death cut scene, or giving up to hide again. The save points are too far between, especially for a novice adventure gamer as myself. I almost feel like the missions would take five minutes without the Alien, so the game designer buffed the Alien to make a simple five minute maze into a thirty minute mission.

Tomorrow, I will be starting on the easiest level, just so I can ""enjoy"" the game from a story stand point."
1823,3,0.4214,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This game looks good on paper but having played it for two weeks now I cannot say I am enjoying it.
Graphically the game is OK. Nothing spectacular and has all the looks and feel of a console port. You do not need a high end PC to run this game maxed out and for this reason I am glad I didn't pay the full price for it.
Gameplay wise I felt the item selection somewhat confusing and (forgive the pun) 'Alien'. It is over complicated and I am sure Sega could have done better, again feels more suited to a console.
The game itself I found to be disappointing as it is very repetitive and some may say boring when you keep continually having to replay the same old parts over and over again because of the lack of save points and the alien creatures ability to always know where you are despite how quiet and hidden you remain.
The hospital section alone took me five night to complete because the creature can walk through walls! There is nothing more annoying that playing for ages, successfully avoiding the creature, arrive at the destination point only for the bloody alien to appear and kill you meaning you must repeat the whole process again. Even using sound bombs to divert the creature only has limited success rates.
All in all a game I am relieved not to have paid full price for and not one I will recommend. Come on Sega you can do better than this.

Once I started getting further into the game and running up against the alient and the synthetics, which require a lot of tedious sneaking around, it got more frustrating than fun. Sneaking through vents and hiding inside or behind things for 15 to 20 minutes, just to die and then have to repeat the whole process really broke the immersion in the story. 

The waypoint system is pretty bad at times too. Having to spend so much time skulking around, and not knowing where you are going can get pretty frustrating. Sometimes I would just run around, knowing the noise would get me killed, but I wanted to find the objective, so on my next load I would at least know where I was going to spend my next 20 minutes sneaking to.

the saving system sucks: i basically wandered around in a level looking for an exit for a good 20 minutes, in the meanwhile i pick up some items and blueprints and craft a couple of things. i finally find how to open the damn door, run back to where i knew there was a save point and get instantly killed. i'm not going to go through those boring 20 minutes to pick up the SAME items and blueprints."

Not really, when the stress is about replaying a portion of game instead of being about death. It'd be stressful if this was applied to things that made contextual sense, and provided security. Security that meant living, not the security of not having to replay a segment of game.
Imagine having to run for an exit, knowing that the Alien would come if you did, not knowing whether you'd make it -and have it slam into the door behind you- or whether you'd be torn to pieces. That's a thrill. Imagine sneaking through that exit after luring the alien into another room. That's a thrill.
What's in the game? You run, trapping the alien behind the door, some peace. Oh look, a terminal! Let's look a what it has to say, how interesting, the Nostromo you say? *Clunk* huh? Shit. Quick, lets hide in the cabinet to my left after I get my head out of this console. Nope, head's still in the console. Oh wait I'm dead. Oh fuck the checkpoint was 4 rooms back.
Where's the security placed here? The security is a save point that isn't logically placed or spaced, or consistent with reality. Where's the agency in this situation? The player has none. The player is stuck in an illogical animation. Where's the agency in the first example? The player's own movement.
The times this is utilised in Alien: Isolation are meaningless. You have agency to find the nearest hiding place and stay there until the Alien desides to piss off. That's is all. I don't even want to run for a door even if there was a chance of it working because there is no security when I get there. I can't even run for a save station, because there's no security there either. So really, I wouldn't even take the risk to even get to utilise the fantastic save mechanism. I'm just saddened by it.
When you make it there some say there is a relief. I have none, because it's still rince and repeat.

Some may like it, but without an option I'm sorely burned.

Even simple ideas like charge-based saves would fix this problem. The same card slot experience but instead it just replenshes charges that I can use at my own expense. Oh look, agency! There are neat ways this could be implemented, and the same brilliant style can be replicated with it too.

I don't mind replaying a section again to pass it. What I do mind is replaying a whole swathe of nonsense where I just explored dark rooms (space station lighting needs to step it up) picking up junk and reading things in consoles, or other various mind numbing actions AND a section where I got caught by a vent-teleporting AI falling beside me with no hiding places in sight.

There are other problems, but this is the one that just made me alt-F4 the game into the dirt.

However, once the alien appears the gameplay gets very tedious very quickly. It only seems interested in you, it completely ignores all the NPCs wandering around. Coupled with the fact that if the alien is scripted to be in ""a mission"" it will just loiter around that area, suspiciously close to your character, seemingly teleporting around rather than moving along corridors/vents.

After the first few times it magically locates and kills you (the first time is indeed chilling), it just becomes a save/load fest devoid of any suspense or tension because you just wonder when the last time you saved it was and hope it wasn't too long ago. Compounding that issue the checkpoint save system will often have you redoing large portions of the game.

Another design problem worth mentioning is that when you encounter a hostile with a pistol and take them out, although their pistol drops and you can kick it about, you can't pick it up. You have to wait till the game allows you to obtain a pistol, which eventually is just sat on a desk.

I think it would have been a much, much better game if the alien didn't actually appear until much later in the game and you just heard it banging around in the vents, or maybe came across it's victims from time to time. Seeing it so often, and being killed by it so often, made the game ultimately dull and repetitive."

I don't want to spoil anything within the first 10 missions so this wont be a very in depth review. But I'm not recommending this game because after the 10th mission all of my saves where corrupted and if I wanted to beat the game I would have to play from the start of mission 10 and never stop until it was finished. Oh wait, I forgot... whenever it auto saves it sends you back to the main menue where you can't access your saves so you need to restart on mission 10. WARNING: THIS GAME MAY CORRUPT, BUT IT MIGHT NOT IDK.

the first 10 missions are a 8 1/2 out of 10 really fun and scary.

I would recommend the game if it hadn't corrupted because I love what I played of Alien: Isolation

1846,3,0.3581,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I want to preface this with saying, i think the animations, atmosphere, design, art, sound, and overall tone of the game is amazing, bar none one of the best in horror games, however this game has god awful AI, beyond terrible, to the point it ruins the game and makes it not fun, i'm sure if you play on easy you'll have no problem, if you play on medium you might get a little frustrated from time to time, but on hard and above it's beyond stupid how broken the AI is, to the point where the alien which is chasing you will patrol 8 meters in any direction around you, And you might think ""Well it'll move away and i can swiftly move past it right?"" wrong it constantly has some sort of lock on your position meaning no matter where you move it'll remain in a certain area around you which seems like 8 meters as i preluded above. You constantly have to hide and weave around it, but if it so much as see's you out of it's peripheral vision your dead, if you run or move at all, your dead, if you do anything at all besides hide, you're more or less dead, it's so badly designed i cant imagine why it was implimented, i'm all for challange but this is a horror game not something like dark souls where dying has some form of benefit or is apart of the game, here you can die for no reason other than sneaking past the alien down a corridor only for it to turn at the last moment catch a glimpse of you, run and insta kill you before you have any chance to react. 

Then not to mention the game has a crafting system similar to the last of us where you craft items from junk you find around the station, however each item you can craft have very very situational uses to the point their useless to use, perhaps the items are more useful against different types of opponents? however i stress tested eached of them against the alien (The main antagonist which chases you) and none of them had any use, they couldnt even stun it for more than a split second, now i get the alien is ment to be powerful, intimidating and giving you a sense of hopelessness but what kind of game design allows you to craft items which have zero use against the enemies you face to the point of being worthless? it wouldnt be so bad if it gave you a example situation of how to use the items but if you go in blind following only what the game explains and tells you like i did, you have no idea. Heres a flash bang, oh cool that might be useful if the alien spots me right? wrong, the alien will be stuned for less than a second and still instantly murder you. Your revolver does nothing against it or the android enemies so im not sure whats the point of even having it since human enemies become scarce quite fast. Overall the game feels badly designed theres so much potential and a great love of art and atmosphere here, but at its core its  bad horror game which punishes you more than it rewards you playing on anything other than easy or medium difficulty, it's meant to be a game which rifts off of the movies, giving you the suspence and thrill the movies did when the alien chased ripley etc, but really its a case of, if the alien sees you, you're more or less dead instantly, it moves faster than you, if you run you can't avoid it, it will murder you even at full health with zero chance to break away. 


Like i said earlier, the game has so much potential but the AI is so awful you might as well not bother, for a team that spent so much time crafting detail on the minor objects and details of the world, bringing it alive and giving it so much personality only to fall short in terms of the actually gameplay, it makes me sad, the most fun parts of the game are exploring the station crouching through vents and whatever else, listening to audio tapes and reading emails on computers, but encountering the alien after the initial encounter? its lackluster, dull and falls short due to bad AI, which is a shame."
1847,3,0.466,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Before you downvote, please take your time to actually read. I know the fanboyism is compelling you to click that thumbs down because I'm disagreeing with your opinion. But keep an open mind, aright?

Right then let's get to business. Alien: Isolation is a GOOD game. It's a really good game. It's probably one of the best surival/horror/sneaky-type games since the release of System Shock. It's gloriously designed, it has tons of atmosphere and for the most part great graphics. The sound design is the best I've heard since the opening levels of Dead Space. The only thing lacking when it comes to graphics is the inclusion of a proper anti-aliasing option. What you have in game is a limited post-processing AA that does a pretty poor job of removing the jaggies. 

So why do I not recommend this? This sounds like the best game ever! It's actually quite a good game, but it just doesn't appeal to me for a few reasons, and I'll get through them below.

First off, the game is incredibly slow. It has some serious pacing issues, wildly fluctuating between intense action and absolutely mind boggingly boring hiding. Mind you, in the beginning this hiding is very tense. You feel something akin to genuine terror as the alien stalks you through the corridors. You listen intently for its footsteps, twitching at every creak of the metal around you, keeping an eye on the motion sensor. 

But once you've done that for about an hour, painstakingly making your way through a large area and not seen a save station for miles...and get caught by the Alien for the fifteenth time because it decided to jump out of a vent nearby, you're starting to get a touch annoyed. The problem is that there's too much waiting around, sitting in one spot and waiting for the alien to go away so you can go about your business. So you start taking chances and you're suddenly making pretty good progress. Except the times when you accidently gets caught AGAIN. 

So, in short, the distance between the save stations, combined with the absolute inevitability of death if the alien spots you cause way too much waiting around and a lot of replaying the same sections over and over again. Once you get your hands on the flamethrower you have the option of running the alien off on occasion that slightly alleviates the ""instant death"" scenario. Personally, I'd had a better time if getting spotted wasn't so final. If you actually had a chance to distract the alien or run and hide, it'd be more tense. But for the first half of the game it's mostly ""Get spotted = Die"". 

Here follows spoilers!
 
So once the alien is out of the picture, the game actually takes a turn for the better. Since the threat of certain death isn't constantly weighing on your shoulders anymore, the game actually becomes even more scary because you suddenly don't know what is out there. There could be ANYTHING around the corner. That motion sensor beep could be friendly. It could be one of those creepy Joes. It could be dangerous human survivors. The lack of knowledge really makes it scary all of a sudden. 

But then, one and a half levels later, the designers did what finally made me stop playing all together. Everything they did wrong up until this point was tolerable because the rest of the game was so good. But at this point, they decided to remove all your weapons and turn all the androids immune to EMP, Stun Batons and Flashbangs. Leading to a REALLY awkward time fighting them. In addition you are getting put in a very big area connected by single corridors, littered with these near-immortal Joes and a serious lack of hiding places. After playing this level over and over and over, hoping for the right random circumstances I really couldn't bother anymore. In the end, I tried again and again and finally got past that point. The end sections were very intense, but nothing could really make up for the lost enjoyment from that stupidly gamey part. I'm also very disappointed in the ending. Too abrupt and not at all fleshed out. I know some people do like it, but I personally don't. 

Overall, Alien: Isolation is a great game with some unignorable flaws. It has great story, perfect atmosphere, great graphics and sound, but all mired by the bad pacing and annoying design. If these problems don't bother you, but you see them instead as challenges or something that adds tension, then this IS a game for you because it really is great. It's just that these design decisions ended up being complete annoyances for me personally, so for anyone like me, I do not recommend this game. If you insist on trying it, pick it up on sale. I'd say it's worth it on sale."

1850,1,0.3248,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Huge disappointment!! Graphically this game is stunning. 10 out of 10 for graphics and atmosphere. Then you start to play the game. At first glance the game appears to be great but then you start to realise that this is a very old style of game with revamped graphics.

Firstly, enemy AI; there really isn't any. Every time you come across an enemy they are not actually walking around the base and you just bumped into them. There are trigger points in the game that when you cross then the enemy just shows up at that point. There is absolutely no randomness to any of it. For example, at one point you have to access the elevator to the Comm Room. When you show up in the area where the elevator is you will find a woman there who will immediately panic and fire at you before running off to get her friends. If you walk over to the elevator then you will automatically pick up a hack tool and that will trigger the woman coming back with her friends. If you don't go to the elevator then you can search the entire area unhindered and the woman and her group are not there at all. They just appear out of nowhere while you are picking up the hack tool.

Secondly, the Xenomorph; I have to ask if the developers of the game even watched Alien? The alien in this game moves all wrong and behaves totally wrong. I came across the alien while it was in the process of killing the same group I encountered by the elevator. Rather than being fast and scary like in the films, the xenomorph (alien) just walked around in slow motion as though it was trying to impersonate a fairy tale giant for a kids party. And all the while the three humans shot it with pistols and shotguns while it just ignored the hits and slowly walked up to them to kill them. What horrific animation to a graphically fantastic game.

Thirdly, weapons. Early in the game you get a pistol. What is the point of it when humans are the only thing that seem to be affected by it? I got caught by one of the working joes in the game. I shot it twice in the head and it just ignored it and kept on coming. Pointless.

Finally, the motion sensor. One of the mst memorable part of the film Aliens was the beep sound from the motion sensor. In such a dark isolated environment such as the setting of the film, that one beeping sound you get from the motion sensor was able to put complete terror into a scene. Any you removed it for the game!! Great, there is a functional motion sensor. Without the sound though you missed out on vastly increasing the tension of th game.

All in all I have to say this game is a really poor effort. I would give it maybe 3 out of 10 in total. And that is really only because of the graphics."

I'm one of those people who pays money for games and expects to have a moderate amount of fun during the first 43 minutes.

In this game, I changed clothes, TWICE. I also read 7 e-mails, no joke. I learned how to run. Then I found a bunch of doors I couldn't open. Then I read some more e-mails.

I also found 5 save points. Zero aliens. Perhaps it's old school and there is only ONE alien - which I am fine with.

 I think I saw a weird shadow once, but wasn't sure.

I wish I could attach a picture for you to look at, a screen shot I saved from the game, so that you wouldn't have to take my word for it on this.  Some games that are console ports do a good job of hiding it, sometimes to the point that I'm surprised to learn that a game is a console port.  Then there are others that make it very obvious, then there is this one.  I tried to look up the controls, remember I'm on PC, and the controls map is literally a picture of an X-box controller with labels and lines telling me what each bumper and thumb stick does.

However, after the rave reviews, and given the cost of this game, I expected much more. But at it's core it's simply a very hard stealth/survival game, and there will be very little you havent seen before. Just another franchise implementation, basically zero innovation. 

First thing you'll notice is that there's no jump, i.e. your character can't even climb over a 2 foot obstacle. Level design and Mission resolution seems pretty linear, with very few options available to the player, which makes it feel pretty forced. You just have to try and try again until you find that single solution which will allow you to progress. Brain-dead savepoint based save systems, infecting the game design since the early console games - but in this case its even more annoying than usual.

Due to the annoying save system, the high difficulty level, and the outdated level design, I didn't nearly enjoy this games as much as I had hoped and expected.

Also, as opposed to most other stealth games, violence as last resort only works against human opponents.

Given the cost, this is not recommended."

only reason I could tolerate playing through the entire game was because of mods. 

Mods required:
* SweetFX v2.0 Preview 8 by CeeJay.dk - for a clearer picture and better colors.
* Modded settings file by AngelGrave13 for improved graphics and DECENT FIELD OF VIEW - seems to me the pc version have been downgraded to match the console versions.
* Unpredictable alien - so that the aliens acts like an alien, and not an deadly mosquito constanty flying around your head.

With these mods the game was mostly good, but:

Negatives:
* you kill enemies with guns, but you cannot pick up these guns, you have to wait for that special one that lies on a desk... sloppy, breaks immersion.
* seemingly broken/inactive androids can suddenly attack you when you walk past them, but before they attack you most weapons seems to have no affect on them... sloppy, breaks immersion.
* you see civilians escaping around the corner, you go around that same corner 2 seconds later to find out that it's just a dead end... again sloppy, breaks immersion.
* more cases like the ones mentioned above
* bugs (not gamebreaking but annoying)

Story:
* The game overstays its welcome, the ending is faaaaar too long with lots of back and forth. 
* In general ending is not great, and with a ""cliffhanger"" ... come on.

Conclusion:
Long story short, I went from exited to bored to slighty annoyed.

I managed to squash all crashing by reverting my Nvidia driver back in time to the 347.09 driver (12/2014) since no newer drivers were usable with this game.

I personally don't get a thrill from the references and I found the planet side portion of the game very tedious.  Tedious, I find, is a good desciptive of the game as a whole.  It starts well when you first get on the station, but then it just keeps going and going.  And you are never off the leash.  Everything you do is dictated by the quest log.  Even doors are arbitrarily locked or unlocked are your progress demands.
As a purely subjective comment, the alien is never scary or menacing.  It's basically a one hit kill, so all it does is thump stupidly around the room than bugger off.
The game does look pretty nice, although repetitive, and I didn't have any performance issues.  The only glitch I came across that I noticed was gun models floating in mid-air, which was odd, but easy to ignore.

p.s.: I found the ending very insulting and not at all worth the effort of slogging through the game.  Other people liked it, so your mileage may vary."
1873,3,0.56,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","While brilliant in many ways, from it's incredible and authentic atmosphere, Alien: Isolation soon wears out its welcome. The first 5 hours of this game were some of the best I'd experienced in a game, but after 25 hours, I was ready to quit. 

Everything about the game looks and sounds amazing, making the player feel as though they are really there. 

The alien that hunts you is not fully scripted, but AI controlled and unpredictable. Players must hide or use makeshift implements to distract it.  While this is sometimes great, it becomes frustrating when you die over and over.  The first death is shocking and scary.  The tenth is just tedious.  A lot of it comes down to poor level design.  The Nostromo DLC missions, and some places in the main game, like the escape pod sequence, are outstanding.  Too many other places are way too cramped or lack the ability to maneuver effectively.

Many sequences in the game involve these very creepy and uncanny androids that have turned hostile.  Despite the great visual design, encounters with these things often turned into a Benny Hill sequence of running around a table a dozen times as they chased me.  

There's a thin line between a horror experience being tense and being frustrating, and this game frequently breaks it.  The presence of constant save stations broke the immersion, and are a sign that the designers intended players to die frequently, which as I've said saps games of tension.  Amnesia: The Dark Descent handled things much better, through the use of checkpoints to ease players dieing too often.  

The game needed more quiet moments, perhaps filled in with some puzzle elements (Ripley is supposed to be an engineer, so an organic way to implement this could be her fixing various parts of the station).  The game is also way too long.  There felt like there were 2 or even three moments when the game was going to end, but it kept going, long after the gameplay had shown all it had to offer.

The worst offender, though, was that we simply encounter the alien way, way too much.  After a certain point, the player is so accustomed to the creature, and has had the time to figure out all the gamey ways to get around it, that it's no longer scary.  That's why the most effective horror movies or games show the monster only sparingly, so that the player is not familiar with it.

I do look forward to a sequel to this game, and I think with a few tweaks, like a more intricate level design and a more sparing use of the alien, it could be a remarkable experience."

Maybe I was expecting too much. I grew my fingernails, bought some brown trousers and a portable crash unit in expectation of terror. Problem is the alien is thick as s**t. For a supreme predator and killing machine it's not very good at spotting its prey. Hide behind a chair, hide under a desk, sometimes hide in full view just down a corridor and wait for it to turn its back. Hmm, not quite what I was expecting....
Its such a shame. The graphics and sound are great, definately makes for a scary experience, unfortunately the alien ruins any sense of dread or terror because it cannot see you half crouching behind a chair. Sure I've been caught by it but thats probably cos it can hear me laughing at its
pathetic attempts to catch me. Or did this game feature the only myopic alien in existence!

GAMEPLAY: standard FPS control scheme. You wander around the ship seeking various objectives, with the alien, android, or other humans serving as obstacles. Ripley has very low health, and the alien will insta kill if you're caught in its grasp. In other games this might be an issue, but here it works, given that the focus is avoiding enemies via stealth. Noise attracts enemies, so you will primarily be sneaking around and hiding. To aid with your task, you have a motion sensor, which is pretty fun and intuitive to use. It doesn't tell you exactly where the enemy is in relation to the map, only if it's in the direction you're facing, how close, and if it's above/below you (based on the size of the dot and its location on the screen). 
Your other big item is your tuner, used to bypass security systems. It's reminiscent of Bioshock's hacking system, but is much less interesting; it essentially amounts to ""match the pictures with a timer"", which is not only easy, but jars a bit, as it seems like a pretty weak security system, unbefitting of a futuristic spacecraft. There are other such puzzles, including ""match the numbers"" and ""press E stop the moving icon within a specified area"", to the same effect.
Furthermore, there's a crafting system to create weapons and distraction tools (like molotov cocktails and noisemakers). These can be upgraded with blueprints, but I only found a few of the tools useful; furthermore, the crafting feels a little half-baked, as you will find many more components than you'll need. There isn't really a sense of urgency in inventory management as there is in other horror titles, something this game could have used a bit more of.
Other items include blow torches (for opening metal panels), a maintenance jack (for operating machinery and opening doors), and a flashlight.
Perhaps the biggest issue with the gameplay - or lack thereof - are the non-interactive moments. Almost every action has a short, non-interactive section. Press E to watch Ripley type something into a computer. Press E to watch Ripley open a door, etc. It comes across as an attempt at being cinematic, but ends up being frustrating due to just how often control is taken away. In one instance, I ran into a room past a stunned enemy to retrieve an item. As Ripley stood and admired it for a few seconds, said enemy came up from behind and started attacking her, while I had no recourse, waiting for my control to resume. Now, lack of control in horror is an important thing; but this is completely the wrong way to go about it. It's tedious at best, outright bad design in some instances.

VISUALS: The game looks great. Character models are especially good; they're well-detailed with bags under their eyes, visible pores, etc. The rest is equally good; early in the game, I actually recoiled at a fireball that spews from a broken fuel pipe. 
Unfortunately, the great visuals are let down by the setting. I'm not sure why the ship has to consist of 85% bland metal corridors with piping and wiring along the ceiling, but it doesn't make for exciting atmosphere - especially when the environments are so dark. Darkness is good in horror games; but with the limited light we have, we should have something to look at besides graffiti and trash on the floor. When I think of this game, I recall a samey, grey-green colour scheme that makes all of the areas blend together.

AUDIO: Excellent as well - the highlight of this game. The voice acting is great, with Ripley in particular having an excellent performance. Her voice trembles as she whispers in the presence of the alien, and screams in breathless rage after having been nearly killed. The supporting cast and audio files are similarly well acted, as are the enemies. The alien's screech upon seeing Ripley quickly becomes something to fear, as with the calm, English-accented admonishments of the androids. Music isn't overly relied upon, but nothing overly noteworthy when it appears. Aside from being a nice aesthetic touch, the audio is quite an important aspect of the game - you will quickly learn to hear the beeping of the motion sensor to identify the presence of enemies, and the direction of the thumps in the vents that the alien is climbing in.

HORROR: Running and hiding from the alien and the andrioids is very tense and creepy, given that you are virtually defenceless...for the first portion of the game. It can sometimes give way to tediousness, but for the most part, planning your route around the enemies is quite engrossing. Unfortunately, the player isn't given much respite from the enemies, almost always evading either the alien or the androids. This game could have greatly benefited from the odd chapter with few to no enemies, perhaps with human enemies as an obstacle (as they aren't encountered much), or some more challenging puzzles. Give the player time to miss the primary fear factors - let them become accustomed to running unmolested, collecting items, feeling in control of things - before ripping the rug out from under them.
The horror is especially reduced around the 1/2 to 2/3 mark, where the player is given a flamethrower. On the one hand, it feels like they've earned it - but on the other, it makes scaring off the alien far too easy. And once the fear factor of the alien is reduced, the rest of the game quickly becomes tedious.

STORY/PACING: The story is present, but let down by the game's biggest problem: the pacing. The player is introduced to Ripley's character and motivations for exploring the ship, and then sent off to perform miscelanous tasks. Go to talk to  this person. But the elevator's out! Find another way around. But the power's out! Turn it back on. And once you get there, all you get is another upgrade to use in a bland, sparesely decorated area you've already visited. When the few important plot points occur, it feels like they're added to further pad the game. Similar titles get by with little story - Amnesia: The Dark Descent comes to mind - but that game is much shorter. This game has 18 chapters; by chapter 12, I was ready to wrap it up. But the game continues on, having you visit the same areas, performing the same tasks, stalked by the same creature. At one point, a character sacrificed themselves to aid Ripley, but the drama fell completely flat because I had no memory of who this character was. There is little reminder of what's keeping the character going, aside from ""escape the ship"". More immersive games have a central, driving goal the the player is reminded of. Silent Hill, for example, reminds the player in various ways that the end goal is to find Harry's daughter in the midst of other secondary objectives. This game has Ripley running errands on a spaceship, from which we can assume she'll escape eventually.

Would I recommend this game? It's hard to say. On the one hand, I enjoyed the tension, pacing and scares of the first half of the game. On the other, it wears out its welcome, becoming tedious towards the end, and doesn't do much to innovate. I would recommend a game like Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Outlast before Alien: Isolation. Perhaps if those haven't satisfied your itch, give this one a try."

Superscripted gameplay, and not well (at all)
Writing isn't not as bad as Eidos game but definitely disappointing
Can be scary if you don't see it like me (i.e. one level design/scripting failure after the other). Overall it's a game that wants you to do things in a certain way and absolutely not in another. I know I uninstalled it after the alien suddenly appeared on my while I was monitoring movement super carefully and he was not there at all. Just IA spawn not even smart enough to hide the cheating."

I played it on hard as recomended by the game Devs. Unfortunetly the game really drags on. I have to admit I have not finished playing this game and the truth is I might not. There are multiple times I thought the game was going to end and would have been satified but it just keeps going. Seems weird to complain about a game being to long but it becomes repetitive and fear slowly fades to frustration after you die the 1000 time. The graphics, Sounds and the ability to recrate the feelings from the movie are all 10/10 amazing. Wish they had made this game wrap up in 10 hours rather than 15-20."

The interiors look amazingly like the film sets.

But then you meet your first few humans and the alien becomes a commonplace feature. Soon you spend most of your time in identical lockers and air ducts dotted throughout the levels. It just became a bore and I quickly lost interest."
1881,1,0.7547,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I finally finished this game, and what i have to say is: I didn't like this game at all. I played only on survivor mode and I hate it. Here some points that makes this game bad (in my point of view).

- Alien looks like droopy dee in this game, because he's everywhere at the same time. There was one time that i literaly saw him behind me, and when I open a door, he was in front of me! 

- Sometimes (i mean, A LOT OF TIMES) I killed an android, flame an alien or kill those little babyalien and I died anyway, i don't know why, i think it was because they were to close to me. So I saw they diyng, but I went right to the load screen O_o. Thanks to this horrible programming, I won the 100 death achievement! Thanks, programmers!

- The game is not scary, but you'll be afraid to die, because alien isolation don't have checkpoints, you can only save in certain points, in other words, everytime you die (and it'll happen a lot) you will have to do all the puzzles to open the door and take all itens you took before, and of course, you can't run to do that, because droopy alien will hear you and kill you again.

- WHERE ARE THE FUCKIN' CHECKPOINTS? WHY DO I HAVE TO SAVE ON A FRIGGIN' TELEPHONE?

- As if it wasn't enough to repeat your actions a lot, some missions were like this: Go to point A and open the door. The door wont open, go to point B and open that door. Point B has no energy, go to point A to recharge the battery... I think you got the picture already, and I not kidding, it was literaly like that.

- The game does not have any joke, the only one ripley does, is right after SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  she loses all her friends  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So tell me about bad timing :P

Here it goes my thumbs down :P"

I heard the bad reviews, but wanted to like it, as I am a fan of the Alien saga. I played for 48 minutes. The game starts you off running a fetch quest to retrieve your clothes. Then you must push a button. Then you must talk to someone, then talk to someone else (by talk I mean listen). Then you must pick up a folder, then press a button. For nearly an hour I walked around and clicked on things. Talk about mind numbing. Not to mention, the way forward, is not always obvious, sometimes it's just a stupid hole in the wall you didn't notice the first time, and the map does not help. If you like to press ""A"", this game is for you."

I picked up this game during the summer sale, and let me tell you it was disappointing. I was playing the single player missions can could not even get to the part with the Alien. The game leaves you so stranded. The entire game reminds me of pixel hunting in those old point and click adventures, where you have to try to guess what the designer was thinking. 

I got stuck on the part where you have to look for the data cell, it is pretty early in the game. After dying 7 times without any inkling of how to move forward, i finally looked up a tutorial, and after seeing how complicated the process is for finding the freaken thing, I dont think I will go back to the game again.

I know some of you little shits out there are saying ""you are supposed to figure it out yourself, OMG, I am so hard core"". It is not really figuring it out ourself if even the person making the tutorial admits he had to look it up. Just a poor game design choice. I really wanted to play hide from the Alien, but I don't think I can make it that far."

The game does not start half the time and freezes during the opening sceens.

There also is a major bug in the very beggining of the game that causes a door to not open and does not allow you to get to your objective. This is in the very beggining of the game and you cannot get past the first 5 minutes of the game. I looked online and saw that many people have the same problem and they suggest to close the game out and restart everything. I have tried that 4 seperate times and still the problem consists.

1890,2,0.3889,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","Good atmosphere, i loved how they care to keep legacy of Alien 1, but its totally broken and underdeveloped NPC AI and stealth mechanics, scripting is bugged, FOV is narrow and inconsistent as hell, body awareness bugged and does not work at fov higher than 55, faces looks caroonish and weird, crafting mechanics annoying, UI (HUD and highlight of items) is immersion breaking, a lof of game designt flaws such as when you take out health pack from inventory, or light stick, you can not holster it back and have to use it,  and the ultimate flaw - Alien AI, its cheating, its teleporting close to you all the time, you can predict its movement, cant outsmart it fair way, because no matter what and how you do, momevement is random and frustrating to the level you rage quit game. Also it annoying as hell that alien walk on floor  like human most of time, instead of crawling under the roof, and i never saw it using walls.
Also it has pre-rendered cut-scenes, which are unscalable, non future proof, has compression artifacts and waste too much space on HDD, when it could be done much better way in real time by game engine.
Graphics dissapointing as well, at very first level they use all real time shadows to cheat you, and then in next locations they go pre-baked static shadow and lighting way.

Main reason i rage quit this game - absolutely broken and unplayable stealth mechanics and NPC AI (devs of this game needs to play Splinter Cell 1-3, Riddick and Thief 1-3 to see how working stealth mechanics and AI looks like) , cheating unpredictable movement of Alien, and sickness i feel playing with such narrow fov that jumps to even more narrow at every animation, and yeah invenotry UI annoyed me a lot.

I do not recomend anyone to play this game until broken AI and stealth is fixed and alien will start playing by rules and untill immersion breaking UI will be revamped..

Yes its a very good sequel to Alien in terms of art and atmosphere as Alien 1 fan i love what they did visually,  but game design department ruined art department work. I would rather watch this game as montaged CGI movie, than would play again and deal with all of that annoying bullcrap, and especially broken stealth sequences.  I would say its good Alien fan service but disaterous stealth game. 

Its really overhyped game because of warm Alien feelings which blinded people from seeing how badly game mechanics designed. No where near 9 of 10, more like 6 of 10 and most of it only for good preservation of Alien style. I feel really sad for this, i really want to love it, but i cant love it at current state, this game should have been better and could if not AI problems. bad ui, bad fov and immersion breakers such as crafting.

Dear Creative Assembly and SEGA, please hire Clint Hocking (Nothing) - creative director of Far Cry 2 and Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, let him redesign AI behavior, UI and other stuff, and make with him trully immersiv and well designed in terms of stealth remastered directors cut version of game, so that Alien Isolation would not be waste of your effort and our time."

So far this game has been pretty buggy. The first bug [spoiler] was right after you do the double press door with the guy on the otherside of the glass and have to save him.

Here is an example, I'm trying to get from point A to point B to retrieve an item to progress, the tension is high and the fear is strong so I'm moving as slowly as I can while keeping an eye on my radar.  My enemy is all around me running down hallways, climbing through the vents, and his direction can change at any second.  I spend the next hour making my way through the mission seeking cover under hospital beds and hiding in closets.  A lot of time hiding in closets....but finally, my goal is close and right before I reach my destination a loan refugee shoots me in the face.  Dead.  Now guess what?  I have to start completly over from my last save.  The last hour of my life?  Completly wasted.  And there lies the problem.  With a game this tense and it's focus on stealth and hiding, only being able to save at save stations is completly stupid.  As you can see I have 13.3 hours on record and I'm not even that far into the game.  I have tried and tried to look past this flaw but at this point I can't do it anymore.  Don't get me wrong, I actually REALLY like this game.  The fear and tension here is something that most games just can not pull off, but when you spend multiple hours sneaking around and hiding (trust me there is a LOT of hiding) it takes all the immersion out when you die and have to turn around and do it ALL OVER AGAIN.  Now if you don't mind replaying long and sometimes tedious sections to get to the end game then by all means go play this game, but if not don't bother.  If they would just offer an alternate method of saving complete with automatic checkpoints this would be one of the best games of it's kind.  As it stands now, it's just a extreme pain in the ass."

1902,3,0.5734,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This game really has me confused. On the one hand I think that they have masterfully caught the atmosphere and feeling of the first Alien movie completely and just walking around and feeling that you actually are in that world is amazing to say the least. The environments are gorgeous late 70's sci-fi with analog computers and claustrophobic hallways. I absolutely loved it. But on the other hand, the gameplay gets really tedious really fast and I easily spent the last 6 hours of the game being pissed at it not ending. To say that it overstays its welcome is a massive understatement and it ended up being almost 3 times as long as I feel it should have been. I completed the game in little over 17 hours and of those 17 hours I thoroughly enjoyed the first 3. Then the Alien showed up.

I know it's kinda weird to say this but the Alien actually ruined the game experience for me. When it first shows up it's fricking amazing, awful, horrible all those things you want to feel when playing a horror game, but that quickly took a turn for the worse when the damn thing won't ever leave you alone again. After it is first introduced, you can't take two steps without the damn thing jumping out of a vent between you and where you need to go fetch something to open a door somewhere and quite frankly, that's not scary. It's tedious, dull and serves no other purpose than to make you sit in a damn locker for 10 minutes while it circles the table infront of it. Being pretty much completely unable to progress due to it blocking your path at every single turn sucked the joy and fear right out of the game and left some kind of boring as hell hide and seek game. And once I pained myself through all the bullshit because I wanted to see how the story would unfold, I did enjoy that part, and finally got to what I thought was the end after 7-8 hours and thought to myself that okay, it wasn't THAT bad, the game promptly slapped me in the face and pointed to the remaining HALF of the damn thing. Seriously. It. Never. Ends. And that is not a good thing. 

At the halfway mark, you're pretty much space Rambo with the entire arsenal you've managed to scrape together which completely strips away any notion of vulnerability you might have had earlier and you can just go and blast your way through any and all things that stand between you and your current objective, and correct me if I'm wrong, but that is not how a horror game should behave. 

In the end I spent the final 4 hours of the game being pissed at it for not ending when it had so many opportunities to do so. It just wasn't any fun. But I'm unfortunately a completionist and I was going to see the ending, despite how bad the actual game was at that point.

So finally, do I recommend the game? Both yes and no. If you like the Alien movies and want to experience that great atmosphere in a game then yes, you should check this out and play the first 4 hours. But if you want an actually good game then no, you should not play this because the gameplay behind the awesome setting is boring, uninspired and downright tedious. As an overall experience I cannot recommend this."
1903,3,0.5429,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Alien Isolation...oh boy...where do I begin.  First off, think of this as more of an interactive movie (and it's the 20 hour director's cut version of that movie) than a game.  You play a supporting role.  You will act in the scenes of this ""movie"" and will be forced to do many retakes of those scenes in which you don't play your role perfectly.  It's really hit or miss during each take as none of the other actors will play their roles exactly the same.  Yes, you will be doing a whole lot of trial and error.

The ""game"" has a certain Dead Space vibe throughout in which you'll perform more tasks than you can count and stll feel like you aren't accomplishing anything.  You'll travel through many locales over and over, starting at point ""A"" and ending up and point ""B"" only to find out that you'll be heading back to point ""A"" again.  

The game looks great and is fun at times, but I think the frustration outweighs the fun more often than not and that's a shame.  They were really close with this one, but unfortunately fell short.  I'd give it a 4 out of 10."

I played for around an hour, I am still trying to get the tools needed to open more rooms. I have no weapons yet, I have not seen any aliens or encountered any other sort of danger as of yet.

If the quality of games was solely based on graphics, I'd say this game was amazing. To be fair, I only bought this game because I love the original movie, and I wanted to play the ""Crew Expendable"" DLC. You'll notice that I didn't give a score for story. That's because I couldn't be bothered to waste any more of my time on this game. Which is too bad, as I was honestly looking forward to playing it for a long time. I was very impressed with the visuals. Not only were they beautiful, but very authentic. It sells the experience of being aboard the Nostromo. But when I got to the actual gameplay, I realized how bad the controls & game mechanics really are:

After dying several times in the vents trying to reach the other side, I gained access to the main airlock area. I'm meant to lure the Alien into the airlock, and I assume jettison it out of the ship. So I get it in there, but the game doesn't tell me what to do afterward. So I keep trying different angles, by throwing flares (which the game makes surprising annoying) and running, but the Alien only wants to follow me, and kill me. It's important to point out how difficult the controls are. They're not BAD, just DIFFICULT. This seems intentional in order to add tension and increase the ""terror-factor"" or whatever. However, this didn't ""scare"" me in any way, it just made playing the game more annoying and frustrating. So I gave up... I miss the days where the main focus of gaming was fun and entertainment, rather than frustration and wasting time.

I realize I could sit here and play for hours trying to figure it out, and eventually either come to a solution or get lucky, but that's not why I sat down to play this game. I sat down to have fun. And the bottom line is: this game is NOT fun."

I'm normally a completionist who likes to explore the whole game, but after a few hours of seeing the same stuff I couldn't run though to the end fast enough.

1915,3,0.574,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I am a huge horror fan. I am a huge survival horror fan. I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise. With that said, I would be hesitant when buying this game if I were you. Know what you're getting yourself into.

I'll start with the cons:

The biggest glaring problem with this game is that it's unfairly difficult. Now before you rip me to parts for saying that I don't like the game because it's difficult, there's a difference between being difficult and being just downright unfair. I'm all for hard games; I absolutely hate the hand holding trend in games right now. With that said, Alien: Isolation makes some absolutely bizarre choices in the Alien's AI. 50% of the time when you use the flamethrower to send the alien away, it doesn't do jack shit. Then, even if it does, you better not be standing right under an air duct, because in less than a second after the alien runs away, it instantaneously drops down on you and kills you. I also encountered a bug early on in the game where the Aliens would duplicate. Granted, it was kind of hilarious, but was completely annoying after the first 3 or 4 times. Now all of this would be fine and dandy if it felt rewarding after you successfully escaped the clutches of the Alien. But it's not. It's not rewarding at all. It just leads to lots of aggravation and frustration. The game penalizes you for going fast, which is totally fine. The only problem is the fact that when you die, sometimes you're 10-20 minutes from your last save (saving is a huge problem early on in the game, but thankfully they become more frequent in the second half). Ultimately, this game is just a big frustrating mess. 

Now, for some positive things:

With all that said, there are some things this game did right. The whole 80s futuristic atmosphere is absolutely fantastic. A good deal of the game, especially the parts where you're outside of the space station in the space suit, are extremely satisfyingly atmospheric. The character models are really well done, and with the exceptions of certain cut scenes, I found the game to run smoothly for me. While the characters aren't anything memorable, they're terrifically voiced and well acted. There were some legitimately good scares here as well. 

Overall, most of the positives are aesthetically warranted. But as the old saying for motorcycles goes: ""Paint and chrome don't get you home."""
1916,1,0.5346,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I had really high hopes for Alien isolation, and I did complete the game, however it was immensely frustrating, and with some questionable game design choices, I ended up with not really liking the game all too much.

The graphics in this game are really nice, and I started out liking it, but my liking for the game deteriorated as I played.


It's fine that the game is supposed to be a survival/horror game, but there was too many things that broke the immersion for me when I played this game.

The first time when I really got annoyed, was when I killed one of the survivors (evil survivors) and the survivor dropped his revolver on the floor. I could see the revolver, I could kick it around, but I could not pick it up. Being a survival game, you would think my character would do just this, but no, it had to lay here, because I hadn't ""discovered the gun yet"". If they didn't want me to have a gun at this stage of the game, then don't give me mobs with guns.
About 20 minutes later, I found a gun on a table that I was allowed to pick up....

Eventually you do encounter the Alien, and after that, it will never leave your side ever again. Like a crazy ex girlfriend. You're on a station with a lot of survivors. Everything from people sitting and sulking in a corner, to more heavily armed ones. However, mr. Alien only wants to follow Riply wherever she goes. It doesn't matter if you take trains, elevators, space shuttles, it's always there when the game loads.

And this leads to the repetetivess of the game. Which basically boils down to:
- Walk into new area
- If alien drops down, crouch behind chair, wait for alien to go back into his ventilation shaft.
- Continue walking
- Repeat steps 2, 3 for as many times as it takes to get to your destination.
- If alien sees you, and you do not have flamethrower, esc-load game. If you have flamethrower, do a couple of bursts to make the alien go back into his vent
- Don't walk under vents, even if you are positive you spotted the alien 50m behind you 1 second ago, it can most certainly be in that vent right now.


There will be some areas where you have the alien and humans at the same time, however the alien will never actively hunt the other humans, unless it tries to find you, and runs into one of them.

If you are in an area where the alien is scripted out, it will of course never appear. 

If you run into androids, and the alien is not around, just ignore them and outrun them for the most part.

In this sense the game is very very linear, and absolutely everything you do is scripted down to the smallest thing. The alien will either be there, and never leave. Or not be there, and never appear. It never ""roams"" the station. Either it's there, and you have to deal with it constantly, or it's never there.


As i mentioned above, the game can also be divided into pre and post flamethrower. Before the flamethrower, you're at the mercy of the alien. And especially in the med-bay map, you will have to come to terms with dying a lot. Just save as often as humanly possible, and esc-load if you are spotted. 
After the flame-thrower, just make the alien go back to his vent with flames, or if it's very obvious it's going away soon, just crouch behind a chair for a short while.


*ending spoiler*



At the end of this game, I must say that beating at this game for 15 hours, left me feeling rather empty with the ending. Finally the station is coming apart, and I enter the ship again. Only to be faced with yet another alien, and just airlocked back into space where the game ends... I guess it's getting ready for a sequel, but for me, I wanted at least some sort of cutscene, some sort of conclusion. However, what I got was a few seconds of headlights.



Finally I will say that, even though this game could have been so much better, if I were to give it a 1-10 rating, it would be approximately 4. It's not horrible, it's not completely broken, it's just wasted potential imo, and even though it frustrated me a lot, I still played it though. Something I wouldn't do if it was completely horrible :p"

1921,3,0.4406,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","When I bought this I put 5 hours into it over a week period and haven't played it in a month. All the game is, is hiding in a dark spot waiting for a enemy pattern to change, and sometimes getting caught and insta killed by the alien. I don't fear getting caught by the alien in the slightest bit. I fear having to reload a checkpoint and do a bunch of work over again if it catches me, and that isn't fun at all. Sometimes you craft things you use to distract enemies. Sometimes you hack a computer or wall system. Sometimes you read useless emails and logs. Every single thing I mentioned is all there is to do. I got a pistol but failed to see the point and rarely used it because what is the point when the last thing you ever want to do is draw attention since your character is beyond helpless. Here is my main complaint: if the game was dark, scary, and intense, it would be more tolerable, maybe even fun. It isn't scary save for maybe one jump scare in the 5 hours I played, and a lot of it just seems comical, like the way the androids look. Their shape, size, and look is just comical. They don't strike fear in me other than the fear of having to reload from a checkpoint if one catches me, else I get to run from them, find a room and hide in a locker, wait a minute or so, and try sneaking around them again. In other words, usually reloading a checkpoint is quicker, plus you don't lose life that way. The size and art design of all enemies and characters, scale and design of levels, and overall feel of the game just make it look soft and rounded and pleasant, rather than dreary and dreadful. It was impossible to take the game seriously even for a single second. It just looks comical to me.

Nothing about any of this so far has been more than decently fun. More of a waiting simulator than anything. I may be a action game junkie for life, but I also love slower stealth games, like Outlast or the newest Thief game. I even enjoy Deus Ex Human Revolution much better when I go stealth instead of guns blazing. But this is just agonizingly slow, not tense, not scary, and highly non-eventful especially when you have to run from something, hide for a minute or so, then come back to try to get through the section you were just at. If I ever finish it I will have to force myself.

I know I am in the minority but honestly the game just isn't tense or scary. It is more comical than anything. Plus I heard that when you get the flamethrower the game is cake after that. This game could have been done better, but imo falls short of what it should have been. It is in my begrudged opinion, a aimlessly meandering game where every point of interest you end up at is just as predictable and boring as the last. IGN's score of 59/100 is pretty accurate of what my score for it would also be."

They really captures Ridley Scott's vision of this universe - slow, claustrophobic, suspenseful, looming fear of the unknown. Which really makes the problems stand out that much more.

The input lag and mouse acceleration are incredibly noticable and make the game feel like first-person drunk simulator. (Note - after some Googling, it seems: I'm not alone in this; limiting framerate, turning off Vsync, changing mouse sensitivty, and reinstalling the game do nothing to fix it; the developer, while aware of the bugs and problems, have no intentions of fixing the various issues with the game.)

1931,2,0.3224,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","I only played about half of the game, so the other half I watched via walkthroughs. But I did find that using the flamethrower was the easiest method to simply ""win"" the game.

The first ""intro"" I saw to this game had a part where someone from the game said ""the items you use can be used to distract the alien, but become less effective the more you use them."" Finding out that the flamethrower guarantees the alien doesn't kill you is quite saddening, since I had hoped the alien would find a way to counter you just running through the game. This is assuming you wait the alien out, as there are quite a few points where you can simply wait long enough and the alien simply leaves; so there's no need to use the flamethrower most of the time, which means more ammo for later.

If you're looking for a fun horror game, there are times that it is 10/10 and times where it's 5/10 or worse. The only thing that is scary in the game is the alien, and it is only the threat about 50% of the time-which brings me to the second but most important qualm I have with this game:

""Alien: Isolation"" is a name that makes you think you're alone against an alien, a wonderful setting for a horror game. When I learned there are other humans or androids on board I was considering how that could go. If there are a few, then it can greatly benefit the game. You're about to be shot by a human who's losing his mind or an android that somehow became faulty, but the alien kills them and saves you. But there's only a few seconds of respite, as the alien isn't going to focus on a dead body when it saw another living thing nearby as well. So learning that the alien is only somewhat present in the game and that humans account for a major protion of the troubles you have is quite disappointing.

It makes it much worse when non-alien enemies don't pose any serious threat. Androids are so slow that a little prior planning can save you almost entirely from them ever getting near you. Humans are so fragile that a few revolver or shotgun shots will put them down for good. Yet this goes without mentioning that a single noisemaker or gunshot can call the alien, making it a powerful weapon for you. Factoring in that the alien eventually leaves and doesn't return without other noises, this becomes a one-shot-kill for all enemies in the game. Why have a gun fight when an invincible alien can kill everyone at the cost of one gun shot?

Overall I'm disappointed I bought this game. The handling (gameplay) and implementation are poor, to say the least. Though the graphics and story are intruging."

I am updating my review after playing it all the way through, i am one of the 17.3% who actually bothered. For the interest of openness the only reason i played it through to the end was because i used an excellent mod that rendered the Aliens non-functional. Without it i would have lost interest much much earlier and not bothered.

I had hoped that playing it through would give me a sense of the story, give me a chance to get fully engrosed in the atmosphere of Sevastapol. Instead it just convinced me of how poor a game this is. I was terribly bored most of the way through despite Alien Isolation ticking a number of 'great game' boxes for me:
[olist][*]Franchise i grew up with. [*]Horrifying main antagonist (thank you Healthy Snacks) [*] Strong female lead character (games are too much of a sausage-fest) [*]Outstanding scenery[/olist]

The Alien is a drag on the story, and yet without the shock and jump scares of the Alien to distract you it can quickly be seen that the story is just a mess... and an overly long one at that.

The whole final chapter felt tacky, there were too many 'of course it/she/the Alien did'... moments
The previous 2-3 chapters (as you are trying to release 'The Torrens') just descended into a blur of more rooms, more chaos, doing more of the same things.

I stuck with this... in the end i (very literally) had to force myself to play just to get to the 'conclusion' but since less than 18% of people who bought this actually stuck with it through to the end it kind-of suggests that the pacing is not making much of an impact.

It also makes one question how valid the Steam Reviews are: 12.9k+ reviews have come through with 91% Positive rating but only 50% of people got as far as the 4th Level... only 40% of people completed that Level....

Well, i have played it through and it is not worth your money or time... my review stays nagative.

***** INITIAL REVIEW *****

A stunningly beautiful game, it captures the claustophobia of the original Alien movie beautifully and the levels give you the very strong feeling that you are there in Ridley Scott's original vision. 
The sound is very good too.

Why the negative though? Honestly it is dull, there is no tension (not after seeing the Alien the first few times) because nothing breaks the tension of the game and the awesome experience of the space station as much as the Alien itself!

Thats right, the main protagonist is the least interesting part of the game.

If there was some sense of 'my' actions being the cause for the Xenomorph turning up and getting nasty. If there was a way to hide (in abject fear) whilst waiting for the Alien to get bored and go looking for space noms elsewhere it would work. But instead the Alien just 'lingers'. It is there and stomps around like your partner when they have had a bad day and are looking to get angry at you for some reason.

I found i was just as successful, and enjoyed the experience as much, just dying/loading instead of making the effort to hide too much. It felt like there was little point anyway."

It's less an ominous threat than an alarm that goes off and reminds you to stop playing the game until it goes away. Sometimes you don't stop playing in time, and it kills you!

However, the game slowly deteriorates and made me end up hating it.  I nearly quit playing halfway through, and the only reason I continued playing was because I thought I was close to the end after 15 hours. WHOOPS! Here is a list of the most common problems I ran into:

*Spending 90% of the game crouching or slowly walking.
*The game drags on (it's a 4 hour premise pointlessly spread out over 30 hours).
*Cutscenes where you clip through objects/the environment around you.
*Death scenes that auto-track.
*Glitched lockers that hiding in will always result in death (not from ""smart"" AI, but because the alien's hitbox will glitch through the locker you're hiding in).
*Floating weapons sitting in midair, sometimes which can be seen through surfaces. This happens often after dying.
*Weapon upgrades that do not make a difference.
*Some enemies are impossibly hard to see (I originally made this vague to avoid spoilers, but this is referring to the face huggers).
*Unexplained puzzles ripped from other games.
*Weapons with no use (flares, smoke bombs).
*Never giving ammo or components.
*A health bar even though most attacks kill in one hit (regardless of difficulty).
*Pointless back-tracking to extend a game that is already too long.
*The alien moves like a human rather than like the Alien aliens (never crawls, always stays on the ground).
*Never knowing where you are going or why you are going there.
*Reloading weapons occasionally dumping out all current ammo and reloading only the ammo that was missing before reloading, (Edit: I realized on a replay that reloading the magnum dumps out ALL ammo and then slowly reloads, but only if you continue to hold reload).
*Button inputs being eaten.
*The alien often (edit: ALWAYS) ignores all other npcs and only hunts you.
*Maps being overly complicated. Especially when dealing with multiple floors, with only one button to change which floor-view you're on without relation between floors.
*Inability to tell friend from foe.
*And probably the biggest offense being an Alien alien that you avoid by staying out of sight because, you know, Alien aliens have both eyes and great eyesight.... the very basis of the majority of gameplay is an inconsistency with the movies. (Edit: obviously games based on other materials take liberties, but imagine if the main gameplay mechanic was to avoid making noise instead of staying out of sight; that would've been an improvement, closer to the series it's based on, and it would've helped separate this game from other generic horror games. This wasn't just an insult to the movies, but a missed opportunity)

Edit: After having tried this game again recently, I experienced even more glitches because setting the fps higher makes the audio de-sync."

1946,1,0.4338,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Good horror survival game, but not fun to play. It is designed around stealth, but has terrible stealth mechanics. You have to spend all your time crouching because walking makes too much noise, which means you don't even get a good view of the levels to calculate what your next move should be.

A lot of time is spent staring at walls and peeking to see if someone has turned their back to you, so you can slowly crawl past them. You can't fight anyone because it draws the alien's attention. You are also too weak to straight up fight. The game is designed for you to hide from and avoid every hostile threat. Which you will want to do because the AI has very good spacial awareness, so if you run from an encounter they can still track your exact path and hiding spot--even if all they do is hear you.

On top of that, the Alien has a huge problem with circling an area for no reason as if it knows you are in the area. You can sit in a locker for several minutes doing nothing and the Alien will repeatedly enter and exit the vents and pace around your location. I sat in a vent for 10 minutes listening to music and witnessed the Alien enter and exit the vent four times without any trigger--like a bored puppy wanting stimuli. Please play with me!

The long distances between save spots means you will replay an area until you figure out the correct pathing to follow. It is an extremely heavy handed corridor FPS based around trial and error to learn the correct route. I don't mind the challenge, but the game is rigid in its play style rather than flexible. Also, and unfortunately, the story is underwhelming. At the halfway point, it becomes predictable and dull. Sadly, the conclusion is unrewarding with neither a boss fight nor I definitive victory. The developers force their narrative on you, and it isn't even a good one.

I would say it succeeds in its design goals, but it is, unfortunately, tedious to play. If you truly like survival games, you'll enjoy this game because it is finely crafted with that precise goal in mind. There is a lot of great detail, atmosphere, and immersion in the game. However, I found the game tiresome."

Save points are useful on HDD-limited consoles, but on a PC with terabytes of free space they are just annoying.

The game could have been fun if player was allowed to explore the station and survive or fight freely. Instead you are dragged by the nose over a very linear progression.

1948,1,0.3957,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","How do you review this? Technically, it's magnificent. This IS Alien 1. Down to every loving detail. The environments are absolutely beautiful and the game itself runs like a dream. 

You scramble through vents, under tables, into lockers, watching as the alien and other universe appropriate enemies search rooms for you. The tension of seeing the alien's long tail trail behind it as you cower under a table in an entirely unscripted game of cat and mouse is amazing. This game nails EVERYTHING. And the sound! Oh the sound. Shuffling through the vents, clomping footsteps that even with just two speakers you can place within 360 degrees of your location. You are being stalked and it sounds like it.

But...

But...

It's just not any fun. If your movie/game ended after one or three of those dramatic cat and mouse games and your brutal instant deaths, hey, you had a good time. It was beautiful and brilliant and all those things.

But it's not the end. You have to get back in there and do it right.

And the space station you are on may as well be a series of linear hallways with one-off rooms to the side (Thematically completely appropriate but for a stealth game to have such claustrophobic levels...) so there is scarcely room for useful distractions or any sort of clever stealth games. Just waiting in the locker until it is safe to leave, leaving, and then maybe dying if the alien decided to double back. Tension gives way to tedium, skipping trial and error because there simply is no right answer to suss out. Certain segments have a pattern to learn but the alien's behaviors are hardly scripted at all. It is lethal and lightning quick and unpredictable and escape from it is more based on good luck than skill. Does it turn around and check your room again a third time in a row? Does it ever wander to a point where throwing a flare won't get you immediately killed before it even leaves your hand? Will it suddenly lose interest in the flare and zoom down the hall the exact moment you enter the no man's land. Which, again, is all perfectly thematic but not at all fun on the many repeat plays the game expects of you until you get it right. (And make no mistake, at least on hard, that flare won't keep the alien for long. The only scripting that is obviously apparent is the invisible tether between you and the alien. For something so clueless as to not see you under that table, it remains completely aware of the room you are in and the only exit from that room.) The game begins with all the charm in the world and loses it all incredibly quickly.

Thematically, perfect. This is a hard as nails game you cannot get good at because there is almost no meaningful skill component. The alien is simply better at everything and that is good horror but a really lousy game. Even classic Resident Evil gave you far more control, far more nonlinearity, far more planning, far more stuff to do. Here, you just collect fiddly bits for a fiddly craft system and flip levers and backtrack. 

So if you want to experience an absolutely beautiful, masterfully crafted, and wonderfully thematic Alien experience, this is worth your dollar easily. But if you are expecting a fun game, you are sadly barking up the wrong tree."

Then tried 10 times to find a key card getting shot constantly on my way to it.  Wish I had that pistol.  I suspect that I took a wrong turn somewhere looking for the everloving pistol and ended up in a next level.  Never really got to see the Alien much.  Stuck on the 3rd level and quit.   I never ever really figured out the controls.  For instance the flare.  Could light it, wave it around and drop it but never figured out how to throw it.

1950,3,0.549,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Alien Isolation squanders so much potential it's annoying.

The main problem is that the missions are incredibly tedious because they're all the same: go to this part of the ship, pull that lever to restore/disable the power, make sure you avoid the alien/androids/humans along the way. This monotony dragged on for so long I actually started to wonder if the game had an ending. 

Eventually I discovered that it did, and that it involved hacking two computers, pulling a lever, pulling two more levers, then inserting two keycards next to those levers, then pulling up four tubes, then pushing the buttons on the tubes, then completing a series of quick time events, before, finally, you guessed it... pushing one final damn button.

Yup, that's right. There's no tense one-on-one finale with the alien. You don't have to use your flamethrower and your wits to try and coerce the alien into the airlock before blasting it of into space. Nope. You just press another sodding button. The end. Roll credits.

The game does have some redeeming features though (honestly). It looks and sounds truly stunning, and captures the feel of the original Alien movie perfectly, which is a testament to the game engine Creative Assembly have built. It also has some really neat gameplay mechanics and ideas. In the end, though, it fails to convert them into something that's cohesive and fun to play."
1951,3,0.638,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Personally, I think this game's over-rated. I found it long, tedious, boring, and not scary. 

For the first hour or two, I found it somewhat intriguing. But afterwards it felt like the same thing over and over again. Hack a computer, pull a few levers, start up a generator. I wasn't even really trying after a while. The only reason I took the effort to actually beat the game is so I could see if it got better. There is SOME scenes where they introduce new things and it's interesting for the next 10 minutes or so, but always reverts back to the same ""run here, do this, run over there, do that"" feeling. Without any real substance. I honestly maybe only used a locker 2x to hide from the Alien. Other than that, once you learn how close/far you can get and what you can do, he really isn't that much of an obstacle. 

I find too that the human AI is somewhat unrealistic. Sure, there's a reason to be on edge, I get that. But more than once have I experience the Alien roaming around killing the AI humans, and the humans continue to try to kill me meanwhile the Alien is right in their line of sight. It ruins the immersion. The Alien AI is done well enough, and gets the job done. I found the Androids also fairly bland, but that could be because my entire experience was fairly boring to me. 

I see that this game is much better than any other Alien game release, and brings a new idea to the table, but I don't think it's executed very well. The ENTIRE IDEA is good, BUT, the game drags on and ends predictably how you think it will. I felt like this game should've only been a solid 6-8 hours of quality gameplay, but instead it's stretched to 10-12. It felt like I seen the same thing over and over again. Alien, Panels, Levers, rinse and repeat. 

It's obviously not popular to downvote this game, but I think I would've appreciated a review like this one before purchasing the game. The only negative reviews normally contain that the Alien AI is flawed - which I personally didn't really have any problems with. 

+ Graphics were done very well.
+ The sound was done very well.
+ The weapon/gadgets were done fairly well.
+ The effects/animations were done fairly well.
+ The environment was immersive.

- Some scenes you're forced to walk (which takes forever)
- The game used the same mechanics over and over.
- Objectives were predictable and tedious.
- Human AI was unrealistic at times.
- Stealth mechanics don't feel fully utilised. 
- Story felt like it dragged on."

It looks great , high level of detail and fandomness (if your a fan on the franchise)
Its atmospheric but a bit too noisy for me. Slow paced lots of doors to open.

If this had been the basis for 'Alien Col Marines' with a pulse rifle it would have been Epic and exciting but its like a constant game of 'hide and seek' that ultimately you cant win.

I like stealth games like MGS, Splinter Cell but I found the gameplay here just tedious and very frustrating, and I started 'trainer cheating' very quickly which then just reduced the game to 'go here, flip this switch'

The story is OK but I find the idea of dragging Ellen Riplys daughter into the same situation her mother was in just a farce.  I would have preferred a re-telling of the original Alien movie, or 'Original Story' (but those dont exist anymore)

Another thing I found particularly ridiculous was how enemies with guns engaged in combat stance even though they had no idea I was crouching nearby, without making a sound.

This game has serious unresolved technical issues. Being that it was released ~six months ago and no patch fixing these issues yet exists it's future looks dim and the developers behind this title have gotten away with shortchanging many hopeful gamers. The issue seems to be reliant upon certain (lesser known) GPUs. I myself have an AMD R9 285 (by no means a cheap GPU) which I suspect is partly the cause of this game failing. But many other games in my library (~90%) function properly, whereas this one doesn't. At present the game crashes after ~two minutes of gameplay, or the instant ""Depth of Field"" is changed. For some, turning ""DOF"" off resolved the game's crashing issues, but not for me. It is really a shame because the game uses a brilliantly efficient engine that puts many (if not most) others to shame. It seems to me that AMD and A.I.'s development team are in a feud over whose responsibility it is to fix compatibility issues--neither have done anything to fix this.  

That's all I have to say about this disappointing crapshoot. The game's developers and pubisher don't care if the game does not work once they have your money. If I hadn't gotten the game for free with an AMD card purchase, I would probably be writing this game's developers for a refund. It is apalling that many gamers who paid for this title have basically been robbed of their $50. All attempts to contact the A.I. development team for help with the aforementioned compatibility issues have been met with generic responses that proved unhelpful for this gamer.

1959,1,0.5674,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I recommend this game only if it's on sale at 20$ or less.

It's true that this is the best Alien game ever made in terms of staying true to the first movie, however it's nowhere near as amazingly wrought as everyone claims it to be in terms of cat and mouse hyper smart AI. I think it just has the good luck of launching after Colonial Marines pissed everyone off.

Once you engage the Alien past the scripted sequence, it's with you in every zone you go, you can constantly hear it in the vents overhead, and any tiny bitsy small noise outside moving around slowly attracts it to the floor and makes it patrol it almost non-stop until you change zones, even if you stay in the locker for half an hour.

If it's so smart, why doesn't it check the lockers one by one instead of going around in circles hoping it'll find someone stupid enough to wander around with its loud THUMP THUMP steps allerting everyone of its presence?

The human and android AI are barely better than Spliter Cell 1, at least there you could tell when you were in an enemy's LOS or not thanks to the stealth system, here they can spot you if they see your ear from 200 meters away.

The most fun in this game is messing with the alien, allerting it of your presence then hiding, other than that the only pleasure you'll find is in the small scripted scare scenes and references to the Alien movie, but that's only worth one playthrough.

I felt like I was actually there the entire time immersed in the entire experience from start to finish. The sounds, atmosphere, and overall feel of the game are really good. Majority of this game is luck. I can be as quiet as I possibly can be and the Alien just comes out of the vent right next to me, I have zero time to react. By the time I right click to use my devices to scare it off, it has already got me. It was fun at first seing all the different ways the Alien could kill me depending on what position I was in and what I was doing, but after a while this game became extremely frustrating and could only advance to my next objective from stupid luck towards the end. This is a great game but it doesn't really matter how loud or stealthy you are. There are a couple glitches where I get stuck here and there and they got me, some scripted gameplay synematics where the Alien was supposed to be present but was invisible. I just laughed.

Is this game worth it? Only on Steam Sale. You will pay a little more than a movie and get way more hours out of it. I got my worth out of it since it was basically a very interactive 3D movie experience for me. I felt the game didn't look all that great playing with 3D Vision off. It also has the classic fuzz quality the Alien/Aliens movies had the entire time but 3D Vision gets rid of it completely. 

If you know nothing about 3D Vision the glasses are battery powered and gives you a completely digital more realistic looking, immersive experience. You can set how much depth you want in your games. In practice, 3D Vision is actually 2x 720p because we get two images from different angles, which doubles the resolution. Just looks incredible. FPSs I recommend 15% or less depth. In this game you can have maybe 25% or so comfortably on your eyes. 

I played with a GTX 660 non-ti edition with i7-3820, 16GB RAM, Acer GD245HQ 23.6"" 3D Vision ready monitor, if you're interested what specs I used for 3D Vision. 1920x1080, Deep Color & V-Sync on, Level of detail: Ultra, Shadow Res 1024, Shadow mapping high. I always turn shadows down in most games. Shadows are usually what kill your FPS.

OMG, the Alien was soo much scarier for me in 3D. When it put its tail through me, I felt like I could actually feel it. I had the most fun finding humans and making noise so the Alien would kill them for me, make it easier to sneak through some parts. So much fun to watch them shoot helplessly at the Alien and it just wipes them all out.

It's a good game but I can't recommend it. I'm a huge Alien fan, and it is well worth playing as a fan. Just too much dumb luck frustration. I give it a 5/10"

First, the game is ultra scripted and pathed. Basically the opposite of open world.
Second, the game is very slow. 3 hours in and no aliens anywhere except a little tail in a scripted cut scene.
Third, instead of aliens there are armed survivors that are inexplicably murderous and shoot at you constantly. Game scripting gives some lame immersion busting excuse about desperation making them murderous or something. Wut?
Fourth, finally you get a big wrench thing that you can swing at doors and people. Finally! A way to smack one of the plentiful spawning people (again, not aliens) and take one of their guns! Yay!!

The people roam in packs of four. It took quite a few tries to smack all 4 of them with the wrench and knock them out. But it was all worth it, they dropped their guns! Yay!!

So there they were, four very hard earned guns laying on the ground next to the hard slain enemies. Finally, no more wrenching. Yay!

Now here is the kick right to the nuts.... You CAN NOT pick up the dropped guns! None of them! Holy freaking dog on a shaft, no gun for me.

While the atmosphere and attention to detail is spot on, it hardly makes up for the rest of the games shortcomings.

The storyline is well written and is definitely a worthy addition to Alien lore, but the campaign does drag far too long, and the ending has many fans, including myself, fairly frustrated.

If you're looking for a game that will really scare you, go play Amnesia. If you're a die hard Alien fan, this is up your alley, but don't expect anything on par with the movies, and don't expect to be blown away."

Now the real reason why this game pisses me of   this is not a task in the game using a  example. Ripley your taks is to find  the alien  you find it  oh wait ripley you are on the rag  you need to go to canteen to get some tampons . ok i am here  what i cant get tampons cause the tampon machine is broke . taks updated you need to get some  parts ok go to this area now. ok i am here what the alien is the blocking it  dam i am dead  start all over cause lack of saves this must be very important  to get them tampons cause befor that lots of saves. get back to spot scare alien  off task updated alien ate your parts  you need to go get hemroid cream to trap alien  what the hell  ijust want my tampons . ok got hemroid cream now  oh dam  i am not on the rag any mnoer why do i need tampons again. moral of the game piss you off it gets old easy to figure out your main task will turn inot 50 more task befor you get the main task done and the you will die every 5 min  oh and this game did not scare me just pissed me off  i think it is all most done but i am sure there will be another 40 taks  tell it is done . my funny review

Cliche upon cliche in the dialogue and plot, serious excesses of backtracking padding out the running time, and a sudden jarring swerve from 'Amnesia' territory into 'Call of Duty' land just make this more of a tragic near-miss. SEGA drop the ball again, and they were so close to being forgiven for 'Aliens: Colonial Marines' and that stinker of an AvP reboot. Having the Alien stomp about like an angry bricklayer with a hangover isn't suspenseful, and giving it a ridiculously long tail and velociraptor legs just adds insult to injury. Plus the same canned animations when you die get tiresome very fast. Thinking about this game makes me sad for what it could have been, but I should have learned by now that the ony Alien(s) game that'll be any good is the one in your head."

I can't say I'd rate this one all that high, mainly because of the  non-intuitive user interface and incredibly bad mouse lag. Just to look around feels like you're having to drag a camera through water. It actually gets tiring after a while.

Once you put an item such as a flare in your hand there's apparently no way to put it away. You just have to keep walking around with it in your way all the time. Kind of breaks the immersion.

When entering pass codes in terminals, you can't click on the onscreen keypad to enter numbers. You have to use the arrow keys to move around and hit ""use"" to click a key. It's very awkward.

I've only played a few hours so far and what I've seen looks very good, very nice environments and effects, but game play has been kind of so-so, it's already a bit repetitious.

I'm not sure why it's rated so highly. Maybe it works better on consoles. I'd only rate it around 6 or 7 out of 10. Luckily I got it cheap or I'd be pretty ticked off. I think they really need to work on a patch to fix all the interface and control problems because it would make it a decent game. As it is now, I kinda wish I could sell it."

All i saw was lazy coding, bare minimum mechanics, very average graphics and reused textures - my biggest gripe was the repeatedly cloned/placed lockers and wheelie bins to hide in. Blatantly bad way of covering up mechanics that don't match an environment - oh, here comes the alien, go hide in another bin bro! (OK, now, get this!) Later I got stuck after 4hrs+ of gameplay - agian - due to a freikeeen *known* cross-platform bug from back when this was released in late 2014. AnalColonMarines all over again... 

At least it's still a playable game, but the immersion (which is the cornerstone of this game) is constantly being broken?!? The entire environment is not even intractable. Plus, you can't even pick up weapons or random objects. Really? Why can't I pickup that spanner and just have a different skin?

The image of a freely explorable environment is quickly broken down once you realise the map is a bunch of segment-loaded corridors. More still, the dev's made the alien hypersensitive in areas that you try to explore that are not directly relevant to your current progression in the game! Also, on a huge space station, why is that single alien(/s?) constantly around? Things just don't add up.

The biggest problem of all for most critics is the Alien's mechanics. They leave a lot to be desired, but are not a real issue to me. For me, the problem is that the aliens are kill-able in all the rest of the franchise... ok, ok, we all get you're not meant to *kill* them and that is the nice twist to the game, but not being able to wound or slow down the alien is just down right retarded. More importantly, it's bad for game-play because it often will leave you with no means to defend against the mechanics of *the game* itself. Because yes, the alien will hang around or just randomly walk into a room you're in - where you're crouched in the corner - making no noise...

The Alien itself is pulled off in an incredibly lazy way. It is tethered to your characters location rather than being attracted by certain actions and repelled by others, whenever the Alien appears in an area it is a scripted appearance and it always stays within a distance that is determined by the difficulty level and even on low difficulty the Alien returns at highly regular intevals to try and catch you. Once you see through the poor programming of the Alien, you learn to hate it, the challenge only to have enough materials to ward it off while you sprint between scripted appearances.

The other enemies in the game all manage to be interesting to deal with, androids and survivors are very fun to evade or sneakingly kill, but the Alien is just a frustrating experience to deal with.

Annoying? Yes. Frustrating having a wrench in a firefight? Totally. Isolated? Not at all. It's the player doing scripted events (i.e. linear game play, doesn't feel like there are options to choose from) vs intentionally OP (yet super weak as of their AI) mobs.

The game itself is just not designed to be an actual game. It is more of a highly interactive movie. Each area is sort of a puzzle or a maze where you need to get to the end without getting killed. When you make a mistake, you die, and you have to go back to a save point and do it over. (and over and over) There is no fun in replaying the same area multiple times. I found the stealth sensitivity too difficult, and turned the game down to easy mode. If you play on higher skill levels, you cannot do anything more than crouch move through the whole map, or the alien will hear you and hunt you down. Easy mode is actually too easy to be fun, but you can at least finish the game without dieing ten times for each level. If you are a fan of the films and you can find this in the bargain bin, it might be worth a playthrough just to immerse yourself into that world. Just do not expect any great gameplay.  The game actually took me a few weeks to finish (20 hours of playtime) because I was very frustrated every time I played, and I would avoid going back to it. I only played the main story line, I think there is some kind of survival mode but I did not look at it."
1999,1,0.3827,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Less hide and seek and more RNG and seek. 
To demonstrate, find yourself a 52 card deck and think of a hypothetical hiding spot in game. Shuffle it and deal yourself 3 cards. If one diamond is in your hand, the alien is searching nearbye. if two diamonds, it frequently searches your room or nearby area of hiding. If one club, it favors checking lockers / tables / cabinets. if two, it will check your locker / table / cabinet. If one spade, it hops around in the airducts frequently. If two, it will appear randomly somewhere nearbye with no sound or indication. 3 hearts means its gone away, and if your hand no hearts, you die. 

This is my problem with the game, one which Ive heard several others express frustration with.
The alien's movements appears to have no corelation to its next position on the map, making it appear to 'teleport' at random. Trying to coordinate your movements to something with non euclidian movements is more or less not gonna happen.

The tools they give you to dispatch the damn thing, dont even bother. If youre caught, scum it and load a save. I remember a pertenant bit of information given after a death was ""If it hisses it probably sensed you, try to hide."" Again, if you get this just scum the save, you cant crouch-move fast enough to get out of line of sight, and moving without crouching just creates the problem of too much noise and itll follow you at a faster pace. I can see what they were going for here, helpless survivor  and all but like, I dunno. Personally avoiding the alien felt too invested in random luck than any actual skill of hiding or moving strategically. Id honestly rather have no weapons and avoid all NPCs than the game lie to me. There were several instances where the heavy footsteps would not play, though that may have been it teleporting again; Leading to another bout of confusion and frustration as it appeared behnd a door to a room with no apparent means of entry.

On the bright side, the save points were a neat idea. I found a lot of joy in the variety of item-barriers (that is, a barrier that is unlocked by gaining a certain item) made my progression feel very satisfying and fluid. Things like using flares to distract dingbots were both a bit hilarious and panic inducing as one of their patrols to investigate led through my exact area. Looters can fuck off, generally. Theyre like the guy who says ""I think its gone"" from jason films. all in all, Yes it feels like classic sci fi, it feels like classic Alien. The atmosphere is thick enough to swim through and the dynamic exploration is pretty fun. 

Despite its problems I guess its pretty fun overall. I think with a bit more polish it could be a great game. I cant recommend it right now, but with a bit of modding or patching we've got ourselves a pretty good game.

2004,1,0.4146,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I played the game through one time, on the hard setting and was able to beat it in <18 hours. So it is VERY short (for a AAA title) and fairly easy.

First, the good. The graphics, sound, emersion, lore, and everything else aesthetic about this game is beautiful, you feel like you are really in the Alien universe. As a ""ride"" this game is fun.

Now...the bad:

First is the AI, its a joke. The alien is not ""Smart"" at all. Typical Script like activity, warping around the map, and just general stupid behavior. The Humans are even worse, and the androids pose no threat at all. The only time you die in this game is in annoying ""gotcha"" moments and unfair glitches. There were plenty of times were I would hide, the alien wouldn’t leave, and I would just have to expose myself to die. Every time you die, the Alien randomly spawns somewhere else, so it's really just a dice roll if you are going to make it or not. Another major annoyance for me was there are also random android bodies on the floor, that you can clearly see are traps (but they contain items), however you can only Kill them if you let them attack you first...

The game is also painfully linear, and you spend most of the time following the waypoint maker on your tracking device...exploration gives little to no reward (in game items or entertainment value). The game is extremely repetitive, and the mechanics stay the same from the start (no evolution at all). I don't see any point in getting the DLC and doing more of the same...

The ending is also abrupt and horrible...adding insult to injury.

Overall, it could be worth playing for the graphics, but don't pay more than 20 dollars for it."
2005,1,0.5025,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Dont get confused by my low hours on record...I played the game offline 15 - 20 hours. I completed the first 5 missions.

The good:

Let me say Alien: Isolation is the most realistic recreation of the Alien universe so far (before playing the game I recommend to watch the first Alien movie)...the graphics are beautiful and you can really see the amount of hard work they put into creating the Sevastopol station. The music is also good...I mean it is really frustrating in a good way :) 

The bad and the reason I cant recommend the game:

After completing the 5th mission I stopped playing the game...I probably died at least 100 times (hard difficulty). The entire game you play ""cat and mouse"" with the Alien. He cant be killed and the moment he sees you...well you are dead. At the beginning it was fun but after a while it started to be so frustrating that I just couldnt bear it any more.

The most frustrating thing is you can not save the game anywhere. You can only save it at ""savepoints"" (something like a checkpoint). It is so damn hard to get from one savepoint to another...I even changed the difficulty level to easy but I dont even see the difference. The Alien is still an OP killing machine and he is hunting you all the time.

I wish there would be less encounters with the Alien or at least the possibility to save the game at any point."

You get all this stuff to play with, but if you use it, the alien comes and kills you.

You walk around a corner, and the alien is there and kills you.

You hide, wait for the alien to go, then you go out and it kills you.

The stealth feels ""run and pray"", and I would have been more patient if I could have saved anywhere and not restart 15 minutes earlier. I mean, an android spots you, you have two choices. Get killed by the android, or run away and get killed by the alien. Again.

I guess the idea itself is not bad, you're puny and the alien is better than you, but I just ended up frustrated every time and just lost interest, and I'm a patient person."

2010,1,0.3954,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","The game crashed every time I ran it and froze my computer completely (Win 7 sp2). I got a new computer (not to play the game) with Win 8.1 and now it runs fine. The game is an odd mixture of good and bad characteristics. It has high quality graphics, sound and music, but some of the movement options one normally expects with a game of this sort just aren't there-- for instance, Ripley can't jump or climb, and her running speed is pedestrian. There is no ""quick save"" feature either, so one is constantly replaying segments that ended in untimely death.

After one gets through the first 3 or so introductory segments one meets the alien. From then on the alien is always nearby. No matter how far Ripley travels by transport or how stealthily she moves, the alien magically knows where she is, and frequently appears just on the other side of a door in the opposite direction from where it was headed (according to the motion tracker).  When one finally succeeds in eluding the alien long enough to make it to the mission destination, the reason for moving there is not easily found, again allowing Mr. Alien to show up and end any search activities. 

The other issue is that the game is clearly based on the movies, and in the movies the basic hunter-killer alien isn't impregnable. Their power came through numbers and stealth. In this game the alien tromps around openly and noisily and Ripley seems powerless to hurt it even though she appears to have a .357 magnum revolver.  The other jarring note is that 1970's technology shows up all over this futuristic space station. At first it just seems odd, but then it becomes irritating. It is currently 2015 and nobody uses cassette tape recorders anymore, so why would they figure prominently in the future?  

I found the game to be tense and exciting the first few times I had to elude the alien, but then it just became tedious and unrewarding."
2011,1,0.4066,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","This is a well made game. The graphics on eyefinity are beautiful, smooth as. The sound is fantastic, the story is great at points. The reason I am not reccomending this game is because of the constant feeling of climax. 

There are about 6 times thoughout the game that you think it is over or about to be over/complete. Now the first few were interesting twists but when you are about to complete the game and /spoiler and alien drags you back about 15 min for no reason the game becomes completly comical. I thought the arrogance of the developers, for the user to get to the end and be dragged back about 5 steps to artificially prolong gameplay. Dont claim a 20+ hr game if 15+hrs is just the user being dragged back and back for no reason. Now I know dev's would claim the reason you got dragged back is to make you feel more clostrophobic, that the ship is falling apart and desperation to get out but I could have walked out of that door without that drag back and be completly the same. There was no character development or anything like that, If I were reading a book I could have skipped a god damn chapter.

It may not be a suprise to some but this is another one of the games where:
ESCAPE THE SHIP > OPEN THE DOOR > GET THE POWER GOING > TO GET THE POWER GOING GO TO TRANSIT > NO POWER FOR TRANSIT > GET POWER FOR TRASIT > GO TO REACTOR > REACTOR HAS LOCKED DOOR > FIND KEY CARD > GET KEY CARD > NEED ION TORCH > FIND ION TORCH > WHAT IS THE WEIGHT OF THE SUN.

to be honest half the time I forgot what I was doing for any reason the story is so tied up in this web of expanding gameplay.

Game went like this for me:
START > FEAR
FOUND FLAMTHROWER > EXCITE/LACK OF FEAR
AFTER THE 4th PRETEND END > ANGER, FRUSTRATION & BORDEM

Maybe for cheap, but just be aware of the above. I wish I was."
2012,1,0.5665,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I feel the game is cheating on me. It is a very well made game in terms of graphics and all the stuff. Very nice. But why does the human enemies always search where I am hiding? The first time you meet them in this big hall with ballustrades on both sides. When you are entering the room they search downstairs when you get upstairs they just coincidentally search upstairs as well. And when I get further they follow me out of pure coincidence. And of course, not to mention they got these eagle eyes. Nice.
This is no stealth game like Metal Gear Solid where you can actually get away from your opponents by deploying stealth or outsmart them. You get by by reloading and pure chance. One time I wanted to lure them after me and ran back and fro in circles on the stairs in the lobby to have them chase me and then bypass them. They were like, looking, staring and then calling off the search: ""Just my imagination."" Then I frustratedly stopped, crouched and after some seconds they spotted me and started to shoot. Yea, right.
In this game your enemies always search near you, because the game knows where you are. And the Alien? Yea, I am on the edge of my seat. But why is it always rummaging near you, even if you sneaked into the next dozen of rooms unseen? And then in this comm section where alarms are blaring all over, androids are running all around and you are sneaking through the shadows, the Alien is always in the vents over your head. How? It smells me? Oh yes, my smell must be something wall-shattering and steel-piercing unique. Please just come down and simply relieve me of my smells, okay?  Oh, you do not come down? Why is that? Something menacing down here? No? So you just happen to be drooling in your vent right over my head now, right? Well, I call you a cheater, mate.
You know what I hate about horror movies? The stupidity. The opponents are cheating on you. They know things only the script writers know and you are expected to believe that. I hate that and I do not watch horror movies, because - besides the fear - they simply insult me. Never experienced that? You have. And we are on the same page now.
And now I bought this game where on this huge space station where you got stations and trains connecting the huge vastness of this thing, one single Alien always creeps through the vents right over my head. Never mind I just took a train somewhere else. Never mind I sneaked for miles and miles unseen. Never mind the architects probably did not design the vents for being some interconnecting fast-travel-network for aliens to keep lurking whereever you go. Never mind my chance I could even live all my life on this station and by pure chance would never meet this thing and we both grew old there and never knew of each other due to simple vastness. But here I am with an alien constantly over my head and I am to believe that, right? Really? I hate it. But I will continue playing the game and will beat it. And all the times the game places me in situations where the Alien cheated me to death again I will have this tired and annoyed look on my face and shrug it off. I think. Or I might just dump this game. Who knows.

Update: I had this great experience in the train station where the Alien was just on the other side of one of these solid columns and was stomping up and down and I was tiptoeing around this column to avoid contact and I was so sure I was gonna die, but somehow it stomped off for a moment and I was abe to dart into one open train there and escape. That was actually awesome in hind-sight, but absolutely terrifying in that moment, of course. But again, the game says the transfer system would be the fastest way to travel around the three towers of the station, but that cannot be true: The vents are obviously as fast, because the Alien was in the next station in short.

[SPOILER] And now I am in the medical area and, of course, the same thing happens again: When you start off the Alien is searching near you. When you get further into the next area without making a noise the Alien is searching near you as well. And so on. [/SPOILER]

This goes as far that you are getting into the next area unseen, the door closes behind you, and you sneak into the next bureau and hide there in the locker just to relax a moment and what happens? After a moment the Alien stomps in, goes straight to the locker and says hello. So if it does smell you so well that it can follow you into ares without having seen you, then just so it should be able to pinpoint your very location right away, just like I experienced. But if that would be the case, the game would be pointless, so this was just coincidence, I guess. Btw when you got such heavy footing how on earth are you able to walk through vents which are only supposed to carry air?

Anyways, if you like getting fooled over and cheated on, all while wetting your pants, this is your game and the game is absoltely marvellous at that. And I have to add, that the graphics are really really great and the game mechanics as well. So the guys did make a good game there. They just shouldnt have let the Alien check the script now and then."
2013,2,0.3789,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","Pretty, but boring & frustrating. I love the Alien franchise, and picked this game up based on the great screenshots. I thought it would be a horror-action game like Dead Space, but it's more like Gone Home or one of those other exploration FPS games. Weapons are useless against enemies, I shot one bad guy in the head 5 times and he just walked up and strangled me... your only option is to run & hide in the lockers and cabinets scattered through the level. Even then, if an enemy saw you heading for a locker, they'll just open the door and kill you. The alien is invincible, bullets just bounce off it.

The only part I like about the game are the aethetics, the ship, clothing/spacesuits, and computer UI designs are all top notch, but the gameplay is not for and FPS player like me. One of the few games on my Steam list that I regret buying."

2015,3,0.7591,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This game is wonderful!!!.... except..
while this game is very interesting, immersive, scary and has an ai that delivers, it ultimately becomes a montonous trudge as you try to outsmart the alien the same way only in diffrent rooms. Maybe if the rooms delivered more diversity it might have been more interesting. Also i would like to add that the synthetics where an unessissary addition that become more of an annoyance then anything. The sad thing is the begining where the alien isnt even in the game yet is the scariest bit and really just goes downhill from there. The random instakill on anything above easy is also frustrtating and can make you rage for hours, especially when your only a couple feet from the save point. Really i think they did alot of work on it but it just didnt become enjoyable to play."
2016,3,0.4582,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I really wanted to like this game. The visual style, atmosphere, sound design, and faithfulness to the orgininal film are all amazing. Chunky, unreliable gizmos clunk and whirr and play silly chiptunes while displaying their manufacturer's logos. The Alien looks perfect, makes appropriately creepy sounds, and has convincing animations.

Unfortunately you can't create a good game on style alone. At some point in this game's development, its creators decided that dying repeatedly in the most frustrating and random of ways equates to ""scary"". Repeating the same areas again and again until the Alien happens to thump off to the right instead of the left, giving you that crucial few seconds to enter a door code or cut it open with a torch simply isn't fun.

As someone who has put many hundreds of hours into the first three Thief games (the ones that count), Achieved the highest ratings in the last few Hitman games, played successfully through Deus Ex: HR and Dishonored in stealth playstyles on high difficulty settings, and even who makes his Skyrim and Fallout-type characters stealth-based, I can assert that it is not the vulnerable-protagonist stealth gameplay of Alien: Isolation that is stumping me.

Saying that the Alien's behaviour is unpredictable and ""natural"" may sound like fun, but what it amounts to is repeatedly rolling dice until you get a lucky roll and can move to the next savepoint. The Alien, completely at random as far as I can tell, magically gains the ability to see through hiding places, changes direction without warning, and drops out of holes in the ceiling, sometimes in areas where the player cannot take any action to save himself. Sometimes it does these things, and sometimes you get lucky. If you enjoy reloading saves until you get lucky, then by all means this is the game for you.

To me, it isn't scary at all. It's just frustrating. I got enough of Evil Otto back in the 80's.

Edit: Having put a few more hours into this game in the hopes that it would improve, it doesn't, really. It does become slightly less frustrating, as they give you more options for dealing with the Alien (namely, a flamethrower), but it remains repetitive and far, far too long. Literally nothing works on the first try, and apparently being a space engineer is a comedy of errors, where in order to flip switch A, you have to climb down into a dark scary corridor to flip switch B. But wait, you can't power up switch B because there are 3 circuit breakers that need flipping first-- and so on. 

Additionally, a lot of the tension is artificial, generated by the loud soundtrack and overpowering ambient noises (which frequently overpower the dialogue completely. I've missed several bits of story because I simply couldn't hear what was being said over the music or rumbling elevator or hissing steam, or whatever obnoxious overpowering noise. My sound settings are default; I shouldn't have to adjust relative music/speech/environment volume to make the game useable.)

I will finish the game just for the sake of having done so, but it is feeling more and more like a chore. It still isn't scary like Silent Hill or the Shalebridge Cradle in Thief 3. Its jump scares are cheap and it fails at generating a sense of dread, unlike some of the X labs in STALKER games, where you are reluctant to keep moving forward because of the creepy atmosphere and fear of the unknown.

Buy it when it goes down to 14.99 USD or something, if you're curious about the design and atmosphere. Otherwise, just pass on it."

  My main gripe is the lack of save game locations.  I dont mind reloading a mission and replaying.  However it seems like I am just retrying in order to learn the ""pattern"" of the alien and the level.  Which is fine... if I had more save game locations.

  To replay a level for 5 minutes and get ot the point where I died and l try someithing new amd fail is just a waste of my time after the third or fourth or tenth or fourteenth time.

2020,1,0.4757,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Ultimately, what could have been a fantasic game is killed by a save system which is simply the worst I have ever experienced.  In some parts of the game you simply find yourself repeating the same scenario over and over, endlessly, until you finally stumble your way through.  At what point the game designers seriously thought it would be fun to have to unlock the same door again and again in a completely pointless manner, or go through the same corridor again and again, or climb into the same vent over and over, just becuase the saves are so infrequent and that in almost every scenario that involves anything that moves YOU WILL DIE and end right back where you started, well it's totally beyond me.  

SImply put, the game should have had, at the very minimum, an auto save feature that was enabled when you reached certain (frequent) points of the game and then all that boring, boring repetition would have been removed and the game would have been fantastic.  But they decided not to go with an auto save feature, and by doing so removed the fun of playing.  A real shame and a major disappointment."

TGN's tv adaption of the best games of 2014

Now let me start by saying I possibly dont have the right to say too much in this review as I only played 4 hours of the game but I wanted to say 'something' because it hurts my brain that this game can be the top of so many official lists above such games as GTA5, The Last of Us, Far Cry4.. The list goes on! 

I know The last of us is an 'enhanced' edition... But the improvements in my opinion are enough to keep it in number one slot for 10 years - but thats just me. 

Lets talk about another game in the lists GTA5. In this game (minor spoilers ahead) you can Fly planes, drive boats, drive cars, use submersables (sp?), ride a trials bike up a mountain. Race almost all afforementioned vehicles, be a bus driver, go hunting, parachute out of planes, this list goes on... 
Then ADD to that the actual 'game' itself, which is one of the most stunning pieces of programming and attention to detail ever created... (No this is not a GTA5 review, this is just a taster of what GTA has to offer to emphasise my points) 

Alien Isolation is - (minor spoilers) A walking simulator. A 'Restore the power' game.

After 4 hours of play I wanted the alien to get me! I wanted 'something' to happen I was so incredibly bored that I simply could not play any more!

I'd backtracked over the same empty parts of the ship so often I was getting to know my way around. The only other thing I ever came across was hostile humans who wanted to kill me on sight! (which is also completely ridiculous!) This actually leads me to the worst part of the game for me. 'Stealth'...  You cant 'stealth' around anything! They see you and shoot you no matter HOW careful your being! Yet the alien can be right behind you and ducking into a locker is enough to confuse it!!??

I'm sorry... I feel a rant coming on, and I'm going to stop there because I simply don't want to go that route. 

Just know, that in my 20+ years of PC gaming I have never felt so completely and utterly saddened that such a terrible game has garnered so much positive attention. Lets forget the Playstation and Xbox releases for a second and look at Farcry 4.. What a stunning accomplishment of first person action game that is! And yet Alien isolation beats it hands down all over... It's a sad day"

The leaning thing is nice but could use a lot of work. There is absolutley no talk between you and the NPCs unless its scripted. I feel like you should be able to put your hands up to show you are not going to harm them, and then depending on how far you are in the game or on the model of the NPC there will be a reaction which will be either freindly or harmful.

Most of the game isn't too hard, as it plays on my honed skills of social avoidance. Imagine that you are Ripley, a 20 yo college student who shares a house with some people. You are an introvert and like to avoid conversations every time you want food. So you start listening to the old house you share, learning the patterns of your roommates and where to hide to avoid contact. That is this game. Honestly, the alien is quite pleasant to live with in comparison. There's only one, and it'll stomp around and make itself known like an angry upstairs neighbor. This thought also makes the games more humorous than scary, as you play hide and seek, or use noisemakers to direct the alien to the human hunting parties. Fetch boy.

Weird spikes in difficulty annoyed me early on, as you lack most devices for distraction, offense, or even knowing where to go next. Even when you get the motion tracker that points you in the correct direction, the game drags on longer than it should. You keep having to do nested sidequests to move on. You want to leave the station, but your friend is hurt so you need a med pack, so you need to go to the hospital, but you need to find a keycard and password  to open the door, so you must restore the power, but the facility catches fire and you need to escape. The game is about the journey more than the destination, and I enjoyed the details to the sound (7.1 headphones helped track), and the retrofuture design of the technology. It captures the thrill of the original Alien, the stalking and evasion.

Now some hate. Worthless fucking character development and npcs. Half attack on site, the other half fail the game if you do the same to them. Why would I want to read another person's emails while an alien is stalking me? Reading my own is tedious enough.

Most of the game time is searching for the one thing in the environment that advances the plot. Can't find the plasma torch on the dead guy in the corner after 5 rounds on the area? Fuck you. Trouble finding the 3 small green lights that lock the area down for an alien trap. Do it anyways, Marco or whoever mucks it up anyway. All this backtracking and walking mocks my precious free time.

I started sprinting around and then giving the Alien a flame bath whenever he wanted a hug. Then I'd go to use a terminal and helplessly mash B to abort the uninterruptible 10 second log on time, while Alien had the chances to drop from the vent, scan the area, kill me, have tea, file his taxes, and kill me again.

The enjoyable bits of terror you get from hiding in the cupboards is quickly diluted by repetition, since the game dynamics remain the same for the nearly 25 hour journey. The save system magnifies these issues when they can literally be 20 min apart in an area where death is common. 

Kevin Vanord's review on Gamespot mirrors my sentiments."

2041,3,0.4663,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I am a minority so vote me down. But I was dissappointed by Alien: Isolation. Maybe because all of the hype around it.
In spite of it's presentation, it's amazing visuals and true-to-roots style. It shines with money and polish, I can see a lot of hard work. It didn't have one thing involved. Actual talent.
It's a vapid game, syntрetic, soulless. It can't impress you and it doesn't click with you, it can't make you empathize anyone, it doesn't allow you to be immersed. You see plausibe world, you hear plausible world, but after hour or so you realize that it's just a stupid simulation with dumb flat characters and video-game motivation. It's working stealth game, I admit that. It's nothing more. And definitely nothing Alien in this comfortable game created from ton of full-blown cliches and familiar gamedesign choices. Don't believe the hype - it's not an icon."
2042,1,0.3132,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","So many games have the issues of giving more power to the players making any experience less challenging and less scary.  Example: Dead Space 3 and Resident evil 5/6  This game takes everything away from you and gives you limited supplies, tools, ammo, health, and no weapons.  The formula for a true survival horror game.  The AI for the alien is genius .  Proceed through the ship with caution.  Any sound you make the alien will come crashing down on you.  Even as you pass through hallways and airlocks it even seems like the alien just keeps following you even if you left the corridor where it last was.  It just drops down from an airshaft and just keeps on coming.  The sound the alien makes is extrodianary and the futuristic background from the 70's is a nice touch with some impressing visuals and lighting effects. 
BUT BEWARE this game has had its fair share of crashing on some peoples pc's.  Mine happens almost everytime I die or try to reload a checkpoint.  AND IT DOESN'T save CHECKPOINTS.  So everytime you progress you have to save the game at a terminal.  Which is stupid it doesn't add to the suspense just causes more frustration for the player.  Constantly having to save over and over again when you enter a new area.  I guess it's not too bad just really annoying especially if you get unlucky and your copy of the game crashes everytime you die.  This game would easily have been a recommendation however with low feed back from the developers and ZERO patches to fix this I can't recommend.  The crashing when you die is really bad for the DLC because there are no SAVE TERMINALS just checkpoints so if your game crashes then you lose that checkpoint.  I tried contacting the developing on there forums and they fixed nothing so now I have DLC for this game that can't be used.   Just rent this game if you have a console lieing around lol"
2043,1,0.6093,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","If I had to discribe the gameplay it would be something like this. Crawl around... Hide... take a look around... Hide... Wait... Hide some more. Finally walk some steps then hide again and wait. Take a look around hide and wait... If you don't stick to that you will die and do the same thing over and over again. It's probabely a new genre called FPHW (First Person Hide and Wait)

Without a doubt the most boring game I have ever played. I am sure some people will like it if they are into hide and seak. As far as I am conserned a total wast of money. I prefere a game that you can actually play instead of hiding and waiting. As for the atmosphere the graphics are nice and it does create the ""Alien-feel"" but it's not really scary at all. Mostly the atmosphere is wasted due to the excessively boring gameplay."

2045,1,0.5152,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Time for a Re-Review. I'm on my second play thru and I have realized that this game is worse than what I originally thought. My first big gripe is that bugs are far more prevalent then they were on my first playthru which was on Nightmare Mode. I am currently doing my second playthru on Hard.

Enemies respawn after clearing a room and going to save. It's happened to me at least twice. The first time was on my first playthru. I was trying to pick up the Magnum from the first group of survivors who saw me as a hostile. I thought I'd clear the room so I managed to take out one member of the group, went out to save and came back and found that the female member of the group had respawned. The second time is in a server room further along. I killed 4 hostiles in one move and at least two of them spawned right after I went and saved because after going back to the room I found that there were 3 more enemies and in this particular area there is no more than 6 enemies.

Other bugs I have come across include the Alien falling thru the ceiling (not from the vents) but just from the ceiling from the floor above me. Both times caught me off guard but I still managed to come out on top in those situations. I've had doors that are supposed to be open when I get to a certain area not open for me causing me to reload a previous save wasting precious time and resources. There has also been one instance where I have thrown a throwable at the Alien's head by mistake but he did not react to it or me. Other bugs include sound ques such as taped conversations and Alien roars playing at random times. For instance, I was in an area where I knew no one but me was and could be and all of the sudden the Alien Attack Scream goes right off as though it's next to me causing me to panic and move around but there was no Alien around at all.

Next is the graphics. The Anti Aliasing is almost non-existent. For you SLI users you will have to turn off SLI in order to the get the best version of AA which is TX2. You get used to the bad jaggies after a while but when I first started to play this game I was disgusted with how bad the graphics were compared to some of the footage that was shown to promote this game. This game wasn't tested at length with PC. This should have been a Next Gen game but unfortunately the Xbox360 and PS3 versions of the game held everything else back.

The Game mechanics were good at best. For you Alien fans, you will notice that the Alien does not have the behavior of what is potrayed in the films. The Alien NPC loves to patrol in plain sight. It is hardly ever in the vents or shadows just waiting or listening for you. You are going to spend more time hiding and sneaking then the Alien itself. Furthermore, you will also find a lot of times where you managed to drive off the Alien but he'll come right back for you immediately. You will find this type behavior typical on Hard Mode AND VERY frustrating.

As for you Immersion lovers, you will find this game fail you many times. Respawning characters immediately after you save will annoy you to no end and the fact you can't pick up weapons you don't have from dead enemies will further annoy you. 

I reccommend that if you ARE GOING TO PURCHASE THIS ON PC then you should do so at 75% off. If you are thinking of purchasing this game on Console (hard disk/copy) then you also do so on a sale but sell it back when you are done with it. Because you will notice jagged edges on many objects when in motion even on the Xbox1 AND PS4.

The story and dark suspensful atmosphere was the best thing about this game. I think a lot of people liked this game because of that. This game embodies how the Alien games should play out if you are not a soldier. I have to admit that this is likely the best Alien game but just because people liked it doesn't mean it's good or you will like it either."

I slowly made my way to a nearby ventilation shaft in order to escape. As I stood before the opening, trying to position myself in the correct manner in which I could crawl to safety I heard the stomping of the creature growing louder. I swivled my head around and around, desperately trying to figure out how to get into the damned shaft. Finally I managed to work out how to enter but as I began to crawl away, the alien grabbed my foot and pulled me to it's dripping maw with a loud hiss. That was the 352nd time I died.[/i]
[/i]
The only horror I felt while playing this game was the fear of being caught fifteen minutes out from my last save only to have to do the same thing over and over again. By the time I reached the pen-ultimate mission of the game I was ready for it to be over. Except it wasn't over. It would never be over. I would move this way and die, move that way and die. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

The game was quite predicitable but then, how could it not be? The things that were not predictiable made no sense. 

Movement was, at times, nauseating, especially when the camera would shake or force your field of view for dramatic effect. As I aluded to above, positioning yourself in the correct manner to interact with items seemed too strict. There were plenty of times I found myself moving back and forth or circling the camera around in order to find that sweet spot where I could press ""A"".

All that being said, I loved the theme, the old, clunky computers, the mini-games, and of course, the alien. I think I may have enjoyed this game more if it were shorter. There is only so many chapters you can hide from the alien before it gets monotonous."
2051,0,0.4035,"bug, work, crash, fix, review, buy, issue, break, try, problem","In over thirty years of gaming I don’t recall having experienced a game that is so fundamentally buggy and untested.  I have started fresh games from scratch six times now and each and every one has so far resulted in a script related bug (three different variations so far) that stops doors from unlocking when they should and prevents further progress either on the very first level or very early on in the second level.   

Given the linear nature of these levels (they're just scene setting introductory levels after all), it is almost beyond belief that there are game-stopping bugs here and yet there are.  How much testing was applied to this game, prior to release?  I can only assume none, because otherwise it would simply not be possible for me to be so utterly unable to proceed after walking down just one corridor and speaking with one character.  

I’ve verified that the bugs that I’ve experienced are known issues on the publisher’s web site and have tried all of their suggestions, to no avail, despite at least one of the issues having been formally reported for over two months.  Given that the administrators of that site now appear to be banning new registrations on their forums, it looks like I will not be able to report my experience with any of the errors that I have encounted or any others that I might find in future.

Given what I’ve seen I can only rate this game as an utterly appalling flop, with barely any content and an embarrassing waste of the developer’s time.

2052,1,0.4747,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Pro:
 + Nice static graphics
 + Immersive
Contra:
 - Bad character animation (especially face animation)
 - Gameplay is not working for me. Alien should behave ""intelligent"", but it just walks up and down (with really bad animations) and sometimes ""warps"" to a random new location. To be get caught randomly may be funny at first - because it can happen unpredictable - but it is annoying after several times in the same map."
2053,3,0.6059,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","The game is a deep suspense game where you have to hide and preserve your ammunition. This game is more of a survival by hiding than going in guns a blazing. I know some might not like that kind of game, I will admit at times it get a little tedious.

The story is great and fits well into the Alien universe. However it kinda drags in my opinion.

I would like to revise this in so far I feel like I am more hiding from Robots than aliens. Ant-ialiasing is poor, which other than that the game is graphically well made. I have not finished the game as running from robots is kinda boring with the occasional alien attack."

2055,3,0.4418,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","At this time I have about 17 hours in, and am about 1/3 of the way through the main story after one early restart.

I am surprised at all the postive reviews; this is not a bad game, but it isn't the best thing to ever grace the Alien franchise either. Without the Alien brand name, you never would have heard of this game as anything but another console oriented FPS lacking innovation, plagued with gigabytes of mediocre cutscenes and marginal voice acting.

Pros: ... I am thinking... Hmmm doesn't crash; very stable. PC controls are fairly well executed, rare for a console targeted title. It has a space theme. Better lit than the Doom3. There mom, I said something nice...

Cons:
Typical linear, overly scripted, written for console hardware, FPS title intertwined with a low budget, barely B grade horror movie. Has a lot of gravity for a space themed game.

I've only ever been scared by the games Doom, Clive Barker's ""Undying"", and F.E.A.R 1/2 (honorable mention: STALKER series). The only thing scary in this game is how frighteningly algorhythmic and dumb the A/I is. I am not exagerating slightly: the clunky artificial feel of the Alien and NPC behaviors breaks any immersion the game might of had, making ""fright"" an impossibility.

The net effect A/I behavior has on gameplay is to make basic movement aggravatingly slow, cheaply turning ten hours of normal gameplay into thirty hours of painstakingly slow boring hide/creep/wait cycles; you can't do anything but creepy crawl most everwhere without the Alien using you like a catnip filled plushie toy.

You might be startled once or twice (I wouldn't call it ""scared""), and only when the devs resort to cheap scripted sound events. Scary once, dumb twice, maddening thrice.

I won't say avoid this game, but wait for the ""Gold"" Collectors edition to sell under $19.99 with all DLC before buying if you are really interested."
2056,0,0.5023,"bug, work, crash, fix, review, buy, issue, break, try, problem","Not recommended because of technical issues.

Alien: Isolation crashes constantly because apparently there is an issue with certain setups using a 120Hz monitor. The only workaround would be to use a screen mode at 60Hz which I am not going to do. It still puzzles me how a game can crash because the monitor is running at a certain refresh rate.

I already opened a thread in the official forums and contacted the Sega customer support (twice so far) about it - they apparently don't know how to fix it and are more busy thinking about a sequel than fixing this game.

I pre-ordered the game at full price here on Steam, including the season pass (not worth it either, you get a couple of missions which can be completed at 10 minutes each it seems). So far I couldn't really play the game (gave up on the crashing in mission 2, never seen the Alien in the campaign), and it was offered at a 50% discount a couple of times already.

I am really disappointed in Creative Assembly not being able to fix something like that after several months of release, and seeing how they keep quiet about this issue I suspect it will never get fixed at all, which means I wasted 60+€ for a game I cannot play.

As long as it doesn't crash, it looks and sounds great though. The performance is very good as well. A shame, since this game seems to be a lot of fun.

Not recommended until it runs longer than 2 minutes without crashing because I am not using a cheap 60Hz monitor."
2057,1,0.5311,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I have one word for this game: Boring.  To be fair, this kind of genre really isn't my thing but I got it because it looked cool and it was on sale. Even on sale I feel like I wasted my money. I started the game, it has good graphics and probably an ok story but most of the time was spent walking around a barely occupied spacecraft and wondering ""When the hell will I get to see this alien"" There's not even a trace of it until three hours into the game, until then you pretty much just walk around the spaceship. There isn't even a clear objective, you don't know you completed an objective until after you've done so. The first three hours you don't get any items or even learn how to make items until two hours later after starting. The save points are brutal, if the game crashes like mine did the first 20 times then you have to start from a save point and redo everything you did previously 20 minutes before and it's all just walking from point a to point b in a creepy surrounding wondering when the Alien is going to show up. It doesn't, not for awhile anyway. When I finally enoucntered the Alien it only showed itself for a breif second as I got on a transit vessel and it drops down right as the door closes, if you don't get on the transit the alien drops down and you die instantly with just a glimpse of the alien. My reply ""I waited 3 hours for that? Lame."" After that point I moved on to a different more exciting game. 

I may continue this game later if I got nothing better to do, but most likely it'll just chill in my library collecting virtual dust. 

If you enjoy walking around and feeling like something will jump out at you at any moment when nothing ever does for awhile, get this game. Other wise, wait for it to be marked down alot.

2058,2,0.2772,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","I write this review as Ive just completed it and because the last 15% of the game made no sense and broke immersion so completely I am consequently writing this in quite an irritated mood (rant warning). 

This is possibly the most frustrating AND boring game Ive ever played through. Not because it was too hard (it was no challenge at all), but because it was so poorly executed. Ultimately I think Alien Isolation had the core of a good game, but serious inconsistencies of systems, poor design decisions that break immersion and lack of polish make me rate it as a ""miss"". 

First the good (its a short list). 
[list]
[*]The graphics are nice, lighting and texturing were well done, non human models well done - its a very pretty game.
[*]The level variation was great, with some of the final levels being captivating (eg I really liked the jettisoned level, and the reactor), which really helped the game to weather the fact it has overstayed its welcome.
[/list]

The bad (worry, this is a long list - in fact so long I wont complete it, I'll just list of the most annoying).
[list]
[*]Complete lack of understanding or respect for the laws of physics.
[*]Terrible terrible terrible AI (its actually just a series of conditional scripts near as I can tell, nothing was even vaguely intelligent or plausible/reasonable in its behaviour). FEAR from a decade ago (roughly) has much better AI along with numerous games since then.
[*]Atrociously idiotic writing. The dialogue was mediocre, the exposition to the player/chacacter nonsensical (how you get objectives, immersion breaking), the actual plot was totally riddled with stupidity (my favourite part was where the characters insanely decided to dock the getaway ship to the station station crawling with deadly aliens! Idiotic and frustrating writing!)
[*]Risk taking is rewarded with immediate certain death, so the optimal play strategy is to take minimal risk whch is super duper ultra boring.
[*]You have no body. Until you climb a ladder, or get killed by the alien. Way to break immersion guys! I actually think this would have been much more immersive with a permanent first person body, so its a real missed opportunity that they didnt have one.
[*]Its so boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring walking around slowly, collecting crap, clicking on switches (this is all the game really is and it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and.... you get the drift).
[*]The animation system is incredibly frustratingly broken. Anytime you do anything, you get locked into several second long animations, regardless of your circumstances. Fiddling with some a computer and you hear an alien drop behind? Rather than react like a human and immediately stop that and pull out your flamethrower, drop into cover, etc, you'll stand there tapping away, looking at the screen, ever so slowly logging off up until the point the alien impales you. Idiotic, frustrating, immerion breaking, unbelievable amination system.
[*]The human acting/facial aminations are so poorly done. One of the characters is an android, and so this makes sense - it doesnt make sense for any other characters - total lack of polish.
[*]The game wasnt actually scary. Outlast is terrifying. Alien Isolation is boring, frustrating, tedious, annoying - not scary. It isnt scary because the AI is broken, and things are obviously scripted. The only scare in the game is having to repeat something after some stupid unfair death because the animation system is pathetic.
[*]Lack of consistency in the game world - the first time I saw an android lying on the ground I thought Id go and beat it to bits with my wrench just in case it might be ""alive"". After repeatedly swiping to no effect (immersion breaker  - was it a hologram?) I decided it was not real, so I turned around to walk away, only to have to grab my ankle and begin to damage me. So my character (see, I no longer relate because immersion has been broken again!!!) beats it to bits, and Im left wondering what stupid retarded design decisions or oversight allowed this system to exist.
[*]Lack of consistency of the game world 2: lots of things are interactive, and lots of other thigns are not, and there is no consistency between them.
[*]Backtracking. Boring. Worse, areas locked off because you dont have the right torch, tricorder, etc, only to get those much later in teh game, so if you want to get the goodies (achievement stuff) behind those doors you have to do voluntary backtracking. (I am a little bit of an achievement addict, but this game is so stupidly boringly frustrating I've skipped going back for the collectables).
[*]You know how I mentioned the AI is generally broken and feels very scripted? The Alien AI is worse - it randomly teleports around (literally), can hear you from a kilometer away if you run (but only if its scripted to!), and look right at you and not see you, will ignore humans talking,  shooting guns at it, etc if you sprint at any point.
[*]This isnt a simulated space station like, say, System Shock 1 (which was and is scary!), its a series of highly scripted levels.
[*]Scripted sequences - instead of being clutched with terror/excitement, whenever they occured I inspected my nails with boredom - for me, no agency, no engagement.
[*]Attention to detail for pretty sparkly things was high, attention to detail for realism was very low. I spent a couple of minutes in the ""align the antenna outside"" level shuffling back and forth between an interior and exterior portal to turn off the particle effects of debris/water flying through space.
[*]You cant hurt the alien with any weapons even though in countless movies and books they get killed by the dozen. Immersion breaker.
[*]You cant jump or climb (unless its scripted). See a chair in your way? Time to go the long way around because you cannot walk/climb over it. Standing in an area where the adjacent area is knee height relative to you? Time to look for some stairs because you are in a wheelchair (which can go up stairs). Actually, this game would have made a lot more sense if you were wheelchair bound. They should have done this. I do quite like that they let the player crawl under tables/desks, this was nicely done (but not as nicely as say Dishonoured).
[/list]

They (Sega) will be making a sequel, this is clear from the ending. My advice to the developers for this game:
[list]
[*]Simulate everything, the entire space station, with minimal scripted sequences. Make it so its a giant puzzle to play with and figure out. Dont script stuff, eg, dont lock doors for no reason behind the player. Let the player chart their own way, and make mistakes.
[*]Do the AI well. Really well. Now put some more time into it. Have the goddamn AI systems interact with each other. Dont make the humans 1dimensional puppets, give them real agency, the ability to decide if you are friend or foe, make tradeoffs, pick their own strategic goals.
[*]Have a first person body. 
[*]Have realistic physics! (eg dont let me walk up a stairwell where there is fire at the bottom that is so hot the metal in floors above has set fire and is melting...)
[*]Put some work into the animation system for the player, so it feels realistic, not like controlling a (stupid/slow) robot. Make me agile, reactive, let me climb over a knee height obstacle, mantle, crawl, lie down, etc.
[*]Dont have savepoints, allow multiple saves/quicksaves.
[*]Have multiple aliens, and if you give me a gun, let me injure/kill them.
[*]Dont repeat the same terrible crafting system. (crafting is fine as a concept, just dont make it so tedious).
[/list]

To players looking for a scary game, try Outlast.
For those looking for scifi immersion, try Riddick Butchers Bay.
Try System Shock 1 or 2 (get the mouse mod for 1!) if you want some atmospheric space station simulation.
Try Thief4 for a sneaking SIM"
2059,1,0.4143,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","TLDR:
Linear, boring, unintelligent, monotonous trudgefest of a game.  I regret noticing the 50% off sale on my Wishlist and believing all the positive reviews.

The Experience:
I awake from cryo-sleep to see a drinking bird toy (without required water) and a sumo wrestler dolly. Why is there a drinking bird and a sumo wrestler dolly? There must be a reason but there's no time to figure that out right now, I've got aliens to deal with. I progress down the generic hallway dispatching green colored things like a pro. I pick up something in this or that until I find exactly what I must have needed all along, clothes! Right, I must be naked from my cryo-sleep! I get dressed and take some time to play with the shower ""greenie"" a bit... too bad I'm already dressed... next scene...

I'm told we're approaching something or other so I prepare myself for what is to come... but wait... everyone just sits down and looks at useless monitors while one guy paces between the windows. What to do... hmmm... I begin searching the floor looking for greenies. Finding nothing of use I begin backtracking clicking a few more greenies with whatevers in them and stow them away because surely I'll need these whatevers for whenever. I wander around for a good 15 minutes realizing I've now circled everything there is to see several times.... Giving up I access my PDA (Google) only to discover that there's a magical folder I have to activate ten feet behind me with no indication of it's magical progressive properties. If only the folder were green... Anyway, immediately after I activate the magical folder I find myself out in space with my two friends, A and B, when suddenly something happens and my friends are unceremoniously stripped away from me! I'm left alone with no idea of what just happened. Poor A and B. Next scene...

I peer through the condensation of my space suit trying to get my bearings. A few spins around the room and something green comes into focus. I approach this mysterious greenie and activate it. Something happens and I'm standing there looking at space suits behind glass. Not knowing what just happened I spin around a few more times realizing the cool condensation from my space suit is gone! What just happened? Did I wipe the glass clean? Did an alien do it? After a few moments I realized I must have neatly leapt out of my suit and carefully placed it into it's glass covered container with hardly a thought! Wow! Next scene...

I find myself entering a destroyed area with hardly a light in place. My first inclination, as everyone's would be in tense situations, is to ask the darkness if anyone is there to help me. Receiving no assistance I begin fumbling around for something green. The fumbling is disconcerting due to structures failing, things exploding and lights swinging for some reason but I must press on... Aliens!  Shortly after that I discover a green terminal and begin poking at it until 3 new friends burst out of one door, run across the room and disappear through another door. I wonder where they're rushing off too. Perhaps to something green? I quickly chase after them only to discover they've vanished and both the door they entered from and the door they left through are completely locked. Maybe they clicked something green?

I can't even keep this up...

This game is so bad I uninstalled it before I ever saw an alien.

Save your money."
2060,3,0.5427,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Overall I give this game a thumbs down. First, the things I liked:

+ good adaptation of the first movie material, lots of nostalgia
+ Some extremely suspenseful sequences

Now the cons:

- It took me many frustrating deaths until I learned out how to evade the alien while not hiding for minutes 
- Especially in the late game, they overdo it with how many single steps it takes to accomplish a single objective (""go there, press button, rinse and repeat"")
- Human attackers feel out of place. They don't have anything better to do than to shoot at you while there is a fricking xenomorph prowling around.
- Story is meh, boring characters one doesn't care about

Now, if it was only these negatives, I'd have said it's an ok game. In the second half I died less often and ergo enjoyed the game more. But what soured my opinion extremely was the [b]sequel-bait non-ending[/b], which seems to be all the rage these days and which I hate with a burning passion. Perhaps they make an expansion that rectifies that, but for now I'm pissed. So there You have it."

The character Amanda Ripley moves like she has lead boots on, even when using the walk faster option it's no big deal!

Crafting including a Med Kit Oh No, a FarCry 3 flash back came to mind, that part sucks, maybe when the seriousness starts, the Alien will take a time out so you can craft a Medkit! ROFL

At this point I am truly happy I got this game at half price and did not spend 50 bucks on it

I am only 2 hours into it and was praying for an Alien to show up and just kill me to get out of the game, if it gets any better, well, we'll see?

Well the Alien showed up and killed me so that last wish is completed, almost 9 hours into the game now and my opinion has not as yet changed.

It's a cat and mouse game of  a little forward progress and a lot of hiding, because you do not have the weapon capability to even hurt an Alien.

It's frustrating because I'd rather stand toe to toe and take him out than run and hide, but if you don't have the ability to fight back you have no choice but to run and hide, or die!"

2068,1,0.2894,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Seeing an overwhelmingly positive rating for this product I feel an urge to correct this injustice. Now, the very first thing to bring up should be that—despite the developer's attempts to convince you otherwise—this is most definitely not a game. However, for the sake of continuing the review, let's stick with this lie and make an effort to classify it.

One might call it a looting simulator with the amount of stuff you find lying around but there's no real point to it since the alien problem is completely resolved with an early pickup of the flamethrower (including enough ammo to last you the entire run); the droids are harmless once you get the stun baton, and the human opposition is hardly worth mentioning. Even on the hardest difficulty, about a quarter of the way through, you find yourself unable to pick up any more components because you already crafted the maximum amount of everything there is to craft, filled up every schematic and used every item once to see what it does and then never touch any of it again — apart from an occasional medkit for when the big fella is forced to go over you while scampering for the closest vent from your righteous flames.

So what about the declared 'survival horror'? Regrettably, the only properly frightening moment happens right at the start as you wait for a transit cart for about thirty seconds, listening to the rattling vents with an empty inventory. But the rattling gets old very quickly and, as I've mentioned before, the alien stops being an actual threat about thirty minutes in.

""But what if I try really hard to delude myself into thinking it's all properly scary and take the stealthy approach, trying to navigate my way around every obstacle instead of facing it head on?"", I hear you ask. Well, as ashamed as I am to admit it, that's exactly what I did and boy did it turn into an exercise in tedious repetition pretty much straight away, what with the inability to save the game other than in mostly inconveniently placed save points, which, as you may have guessed, ruins whatever pacing there already wasn't.

In the end it's all for naught. The whole thing might as well have been made into a movie instead; but then the nonexistent storyline and the poorly written dialogue would stand out even more. There's no challenge even if you try to artificially create it. There's no need to apply your mind in any sense other than to find your way around the increasingly convoluted mazes of beautiful corridors, spectacularly lit up rooms and ventilation tunnels—which is not as easy as it would seem. Circling around, trying to locate your objective takes up an embarrassing amount of playtime in some missions with multiple floors and the minimap beacon, bleeping away in the same spot no matter which floor you're currently on, mocking your ineptitude...

If that is true, then it was really poorly implemented.  Apparently the game designers have not fired pistols much in real life and make to many assumptions.  Also if you quick peek and the AI decided to fire, you will actually see the bullets come through the wall when you are behind cover.  Apparenly, the game describes these AI as average which translates to competitive shooters with custom race guns utilizing depleted uranium bullets.  The other interactions are painful and less than intuitive, clunky.  The 80s' idea of the future is great, but we can move on.  Along those same lines I have a glitch that makes it so that some of the computer terminals show up as black.

2078,1,0.5111,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I really wanted to like this game.

I'll start off by saying, it's still the best 'Aliens' franchise game, and took a unique step in what was a series of action/shooter style games to try horror. And for a while, it did very well.

Positives include a neat little salvage, and gadget creation mechanic. Things like EMP to deal with androids, noise makers to draw attention elsewhere, and smoke bombs to help you sneak around all added a nice flavor. Nothing original was pushed forward in it, but they worked more often than not and rewarded you for using them.

Negatives include, it manically goes up and down from horror survival, to shoot the shit out of everything if you ever hope to progress. Because you won't be sneaking by that many enemies all clumped together, or the aliens (yes, aliens, not alien) who is extremely agressive and has no hesitation in hunting you down, relentlessly, for minutes at a time. Where your only options are to stuff yourself in a drawer, and sit there, staring out of the little grate til it wants to go play in the vents. Or scaring it off with the use of fire, be it a molotov grnade you crafted or the flamethrower it tosses at you.

Even after scaring it off, several times it has killed me by going into the vent, waiting for me to be busy with a objective and drop down nearly half a minute, perhaps less, to kill me or absorb still more of my limited salvage to chase it off yet again. It's like a chore. Chase the alien. Push the button. Chase the alien off. Push another button. Stuff yourself in cupboard. Have a smoke, or take a piss til it goes away. Washed over and over and over again.

And boy, those savepoints. When there isn't a savepoint for twenty minutes during a exceptionally dangerous part of the game, they're all right next to a, you guess it, alien. Forcing you to repeat long instances, memorizing where the vents are. Or just ripping your throat out for having the audacity to complete objectivs in small rooms where it has no choice but to path its way right into your dumb ass.

The game is bad. I wanted a great deal to like it. But too many of the mechanics seem rammed in there by a spur of the moment design suggestion. The alien -should- be difficult, but your immersion is torn to shreds as many times as poor Amanda finds herself abruptly penetrated by a long tail. A lot of promise that falls dreadfully short of a survival horror game. And while we're at it, 'Isolation' should imply you're alone most of the damn time. Not running into idiot salvagers and soldiers left and right. Fun to toss a flashbang into them, and let the alien just rip them to shreds, though."

2081,1,0.484,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I usually like survival horror but I just don't enjoy the mechanics here.

Early in the game you are hiding from a group of looters with guns. You only have a wrench. Sneak around, kill a looter, his gun is there but you can't pick it up, because reasons. Not long after this group, you find the same gun and can finally pick it up.

Then, you return to the same area having picked up the item you needed to pass the door. The alien has appeared, and insta kills you.

It's one of those games you have to constantly sneak everywhere, meaning getting from A to B takes absolutely ages, because instakill monsters could be anywhere, but most of the time won't be, so it just feels like a waste of time.

As many said, Xeno is very overpowered, but it also does inexplicable things, like, while you are reading a console, it will come behind you and kill you. What were game developer's thinking?
Anyway, some aspects of the game are better than others. I liked the style, the setting, the detailed Alien model. I didn't like that all humans were against you, which is stupid and is exemplified in examples when I have to lure alien on humans to get past them... The most important, Alien is annoying, not scary. He always shows up, always gets hit by flamethrower and runs away, annoying more than anything else. Why does the flamethrower makes it run away, but shotgun shot does nothing to it? We know from movies, shotguns and pistols can hurt and kill alien. Inconsistent.
THis inconsistency continues with crap like alien brathing in Outer Space! Kinda stupid, but not exlecetly violating the Movies. More importantly, ***spoiler***
The main character dies, or at the very least it is vague, as to waht happened. I am certain in second movie they said she died of old age. Of course company could have lied, but legal records would be difficult to falsify. Anyway,in my book, it violates the movie plot. And 2nd movie is my favourite.
In sum: The Good:
-Great setting
-Decent gameplay
-Androids are scary and fun
Bad:
-Story is very awful (everybody dies, blah, blah..)
-Story violates the movie plot
-Alien is annoying
-Humans do not co-operate with each other in the face of clear and present bigger threat - implosible
-Some areas (medlab, Super-Androids areas) are far too diffuclt
-Checkpoints are too rare and are very poorly-placed, resulting in repeating monotonous tasks till you get to a checkpoint

Even following a walkthrough I find this impossible to pass."
2105,1,0.2682,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I have read a small portion of the reviews given by those who have played this game.  The one by steam user 'Insugnus' comes very close to what I have experienced.

I normally play games on the easiest difficulty first just to get a feel for how it plays.  For this one, however, I decided to play it on the hardest difficulty.  In the other Alien titles, especially the Aliens Vs. Predator series dating back to the 90's, you were rewarded for playing on the hardest difficulty in the form of so-called Cheats that you could have active to enhance your gaming experience.  Loved the ''Sniper Munch'' ability the Alien had in the first AVP where you could simply kill the humans from far away with your headbite.

In this game there is absolutely no reward for finishing it.  Throughout the game, after the first scripted encounter with the Xenomorph in the office in which the threat finally becomes palpable, the creature is simply 'there' to harrass you.  Harrass you it definitely does.

There was only one part of the game that I actually felt any hint of fear, and that was during the Flashback Sequence that had you revisiting the Derelict ship that had the Prometheus Facehugger carcass in the so-called pilot seat.  Yes, it is the Facehugger from Prometheus, and if you watch the movie and then the original Alien you will actually see that it is the same creature.

The music of the game was not very noticible, at least to me, unless the Xenomorph was within close proximity.  At those times the 'threatening music' would play out just like it would during the movies.  It got monotonous simply waiting for the creature to arrive and go away again.  Strangely enough, it never played the music when humans or droids were near.

By the fifth chapter the game simply became tedious.  Collect this, gather that.  Make this.  Oh, you're out of room for that one item, so go partially build this to pick it up!  I skipped over so many things that it was a headache.


Now let's talk about the bugs.  Yes, there are bugs.  There was one point which I finally managed to get through that first large room with the four humans patrolling just after the Xenomorph is released that a devious bug struck.  After going through a vent in the upper floor and collecting the items within the small room there, I suddenly lost all tracking with the mouse on the main screen.  I couldn't turn to do anything, yet when I paused the mouse functioned normally.  Simply reloading did not fix this so I had to quit out of the game and load it up again just to bypass it....and start over from the save point yet again.

The only other game-breaking bug that I encountered occurred in chapter 17.  After climbing up the ladder to where you are nearly run over, you are forced cinematically to drop back down to the bottom of the small pit at the base of the ladder.  When that occurred the UI simply stopped responding.  I could move as normal but I could not do a thing with the ladder /or/ the crafting system, not even to call up the radial menu to see what I had.  A simple reload DID fix this issue, however.

And then there were the crashes.  The first few hours of the game were just fine when it came to this, but after somewhere around chapter 5 the crashes became extremely frequent and MORE painful than being caught by the humans, droids, or even the Xenomorph.  It was torture, to say the least, to see the 'program has stopped responding.  Windows is searching for a solution' popup appear just after clicking 'load current save'....and having to spend time watching those God Forsaken intro movies over and over and over and over.....you get the idea.  Those things CANNOT be skipped!  I had one crash occur when I was in the middle of an action, and that caught me off-guard.  I did save about 5 minutes before that, though.

There was one other fault in the game in which I simply could not proceed.  Down in the reactor, just after fleeing from the Reactor Core, the game simply froze with the ''endless spinny'' on the load screen itself.  I had attempted to redo this very sequence over a dozen times with the same effect.  For this baffling bug I actually had to clear my cache to get past it.

One more bug: Achievements, for those who care one iota about them, are not given accurately.  As of this review, Steam has yet to even allow proper tracking of the numerical achievements.  Also, the achievement for taking out the droid with the maintenance jack is awarded in game for killing the droid(s) that grab your ankles, but not on Steam.  The same can be said for getting through Chapter 17.


In conclusion, I do not recommend this game whatsoever.  The developers claimed, alongside quite a number of big-name-magazine reviewers, that they were frightened out of their wits while playing this game...or in the former's case, just thinking about the game.  There is no fear factor to this game whatsoever.  All this is is an over-hyped game that makes a very sorry attempt to being decent at what it does.  Graphics and gameplay are fluid, but the numerous bugs and the extremely annoying Xenomorph AI completely destroyed the game for me.

All of the time that is logged for me with this game, which is 37.9 hours on Steam's Record, is playing the main campaign alongside the plethora of reloads, restarts, and other miscellaneous garbage that has happened."
2106,1,0.3155,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","TL;DR - The alien isn't scary, never goes away, gets old real fast. The controls are the worst sort of ""What's a mouse? We can't do PC-ports"" garbage. It uses save points. Seriously. Save points. Like its from the '90s.

This would be a great game without the Alien. Or maybe just a lot less of the damn thing.

No matter where you go the alien is about 30 meters away from you. Just left an area where the alien was eating a group of survivors? Guess where the alien will be when you get off the elevator. Yep. In the vents, about 15m away from you.

After about 2 minutes of exposure to the thing it loses all shock/awe/fear factor. Its just an annoyance that threatens to send you back to the last save point.

Oh, yeah.

Save points.

What decade was this game made in? Is this a PS2 game? Why are there save points?

The game is pretty much ruined by this. Which is a shame, the environments are eerie, the lighting is decent if you don't look at it too hard. The voice acting is well done and helps draw the player into the setting. 

The controls are garbage though. Did anyone who worked on the PC port even play the game? The mouse feels like its directly mapped to a control pad look stick. Menus that should have mouse support don't. When interacting with items / climbing ladders / etc. the mouse sensitivity spikes because the available range of motion for the camera is very limited in these situations and (like I said) the mouse control is mapped directly to the look stick.

(Note to the devs: There's this thing called division. You can use it to scale the inputs so the mouse sensitivity stays constant no matter how much you want to limit the camera's field of view. Weird, right? Math is like magic! Or maybe you could implement mouse controls that aren't awkward, floating and completely unacceptable for a $60 ""AAA"" game.)

Ran into several survivors that didn't seem to have any AI scripting at all. They just stood motionless even though I was standing right infront of them. Hitting them with the wrench put them into the ""hit-with-wrench"" animation, but they would immediatly snap back to the standing motionless staring ahead pose. Random floating items, such as guns floating over corpses. 

Not at all acceptable for the asking price."
2107,1,0.7074,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I'm trying very hard to like this game. Really, I am. But I guess my opinion boils down to this: whenever I'm playing it, I look at my watch/phone to check the time and see if it’s time to stop playing. 
Alien: Isolation is one of those games you're either going to love so much you father/bare its children, or hate with such passion you become Buddhist, reach Nirvana, reincarnate as a kid who can understand theoretical physics, get a PhD in such and invent a time machine to go back and stop this game from ever being made. 
Also it may make you write in absurdly long run-on sentences. 

I have nearly 20hrs on record, and I'm on level 7. Now maybe I suck, but I beat Amnesia DD and MFP with no difficulty, and I didn't have motion trackers or gadgets in those. I'm convinced that the Alien has a script in its AI where it finds you every X steps/minutes, where X is a randomly generated number. Nothing else explains how it can just zero in on me when I'm already hiding in a locker before it even spawns. And I don't mean it was sniffing about, may or may not have seen me and I went into a locker. No, I mean I saw it was on my motion tracker, hid in a locker, I watch it come down from the vents through a window in a neighboring room, and it just hisses loudly and charges directly at me. No sniffing about, no holding my breath. Just boom! Time to reload 20mins ago! 

Alien: Isolation is not the game for the faint of heart or for anyone who dislikes endless grind. I've played through the same level sections so many times I'm on first name basis with the androids and the Alien. His name is Phil for those of you wonders. 

TL:DR: Alien: Isolation eats up as much time as an MMORPG with none of the satisfaction."
2108,3,0.4195,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Alien Isolation Review

Let me start off by saying that I like challenging games. The first thing I did when I bought this game was turn up the difficulty. If you learn only one thing from this review, it should be this:

Do not play this game on hard. 

Let me caveat this review by listing what it does well. Alien:Isolation has masterful art direction, superb visuals and atmospherics, and well executed music. It also has some of the best voice and character animation I've ever seen in a game set in the Alien universe. In short, as far as immersing itself in an established franchise, it is by far one of the absolute best games ever made. It in many ways perfectly captures the feel and look of the original movie. It leans heavily, and successfully, on cues from the movie. It comes very close to breaching the barrier between video games and art (You know, that thing that Roger Ebert says is impossible).

In terms of being a game however, Isolation overshoots it mark. Hard. Simply put, Alien:Isolation is a long-winded masochistic experience that attempts to buck gaming conventions TOO much. It is perfectly acceptable to have a hide-or-die survival horror game (A la the Amnesia series). It is perfectly fine to have a stealth heavy tool based game (I.E. Canonical, non 2014 Thief). You can even combine those two categories. Alien Isolation attempts to do that, but makes the pitfall of including an Omni-potent nine foot death machine that exists in intentional defiance of your tools, weapons, stealth tactics, or any form of learned experience that you may apply to the game over its 15-20 hours of gameplay (Which I didn't get through. I gave up. Congrats, Creative, you made me give up on a game. Rare achievement, that).

In short, victory in Alien:Isolation is not achievable through skill, creativity, or even sheer persistence learning. It is a function of your willingness to die repeatedly in the service of beautifully meshed franchise, all while hunting for infrequently place wall phones (It never occurred to anyone to vary this by making some desk phones or phone booths. That would've actually been humorous to have Doctor Who style Callboxes. But I digress). 

The phones are there, mind you, and function as your manual save points (No checkpoints) but not only is progress so slow that they SEEM far away (And there are some savepoint deserts in the game), they also lock out immediately after you save or load from them. So if you walk into a room and beeline for the phone, but miss the blueprint, keycard, or computer terminal in the room, you will have to mentally remind yourself to repeat those actions whenever you reload.

Which you will do a lot of. Some people are apparently really good at this game. Maybe this game just isn't in my skillbase. But based on my experience, you will die a lot, and not for any definable reason. This is where the masochism comes in. As stated, I like challenging games. But the difference between difficulty and challenge is that challenging games dangle success in front of you, daring you to be more creative, faster, smarter, better, and then reward you with attainable, reasonable rewards that advance your progress if you do well. Like Decisive victories in Panzer Corps. You don't need them to progress, but they let you get more points, special levels, etc.

Alien:Isolation is simply difficult. There is no challenge because there are no rules, patterns, or models for you to master. The Alien is one of the most unscripted opponents I've ever seen in a video game. Its behavior is sometimes realistically random and inscrutable. Other times it is predictable. But there is no almost consistency in behavior. Proponents of the game that I've talked to assert that this is its best feature. I find it annoying. Why? Because not only is it in fact unrealistic, but also because it is not challenging. There's no way to learn or beat the system beyond clinging to well worn stealth tactics from other games and hoping that they won't be as unsuccessful in your 10th run at a particular corridor.

And that is the hardest failing of the game. The developers have danced far, far ahead in their apparently adaptive AI programming. The alien does seem to legitimately learn from what you do. But the game does not. The disconnect that occurs is that while the Alien will adapt to you, the game is not cognizant of the fact that the person playing it is beating their head against the wall, despite the fact that is clearly within the expertise of the developers to make the difficulty more dynamic.

Simply put: The alien is scaling his difficulty up as you learn, but the game does not counter that in any way. This means that the difficulty bottlenecks early, in ways that make the game frustrating, repetitive, and pointlessly difficult. The result is that the game becomes a slog. An unenjoyable slog. While the game's concept design appears to expect the fear factor to smooth those parts out, unfortunately, for me, that expectation fell flat. The fear values disappear, because the fear becomes repeatable.

Overall, I can't recommend this game to people unless they are die hard fans of Aliens, are gluttons for punishment, or have 20 hours to sink into this game without any reasonable expectation of reward. Even when I did make progress, I just didn't feel any sense of accomplishment. I constantly felt that I succeeded only through blind luck or fate. It felt as if though I only made it down that particular corridor of death because an unscrutable subroutine rolled a particular value at a particular time, which made the alien jump in the vent and wander away for 30 seconds. And I just didn't find that rewarding, let alone fun.

So what can we learn from this game? For one, as stated, the atmospheric experience of the game is definitely something I'd like to see repeated, not only in the Aliens franchise, but in others as well. The art direction is excellent, and really does immerse you. Unfortunately, this may have led the developers to become too carried away, to the detriment of the players. Further, the way it attempts to balance fear and gameplay is instructive, in that fails in a way that is at odds with how most games traditionally fail to instill fear. 

Specifically, most games that don't handle fear properly do so on the basis of inappropriateness (Cheap fears, shocky fears, or just plainly uninspiring fear). Isolation fails at the fear factor in an opposite way: The fear is very real, but the game fails to ration it appropriately. It throws it at you so much that the player becomes normalized to it. In short, the game never lets you feel safe, and as such, the player comes to exist in that fear in a way that ultimately destroys the value of that fear. It in some ways becomes like that really hyped up haunted house roller coaster that everyone in town talks about, but then you ride it, and it is scary, but 1/4 of the way through it starts to repeat itself so much, so constantly, that you really, really want to get off. 

After the fifth time the alien murders that person you just met, you're all ""Wow, I just met this really helpful and believably cast person with great voice acting. Lets count the lines of dialogue until they die horribly!"" No one ever escapes. This ties back to the normalization. You expect everyone you meet will die, and that aspect of the game prevents you from connecting to the characters. Just once, couldn't a minor character have had a close call and said ""SCREW IT! I'm going to get in mah space suit and go play outside, I'll be back in time for supper!"" It just seems like a lot of great attention to casting and dialogue is wasted by the pathological lengths the game pursues of murdering almost everyone you meet.

Which is true to the original Alien. But the movie is a one time linear two hour experience. Reloading to see that experience on a rinse cycle becomes very disengaging, very fast."

2112,1,0.5009,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","First off: If you want to read about the good of this game, read another review. I am aware its not only negative. I'm just glad I finished it and can deinstall it at this point. Here's what I did not like:

Most of the game consists of you hiding, sneaking around and WAITING... avoiding the overpowered Alien or Androids. Depending on difficulty they will find you much easier and literally hunt you all over the place. You will spend alot of time in lockers and other hiding spots, only to STILL be discovered, after the Alien returns for the third time in a row to the room, before you had a chance to leave.  

I didn't find the Alien(s) scary, or having to hide from it all the time. It frustrated me and I resorted regularly to cuss words when it got me. This combined with no anytime save system will have you play many parts over and over and over. I found this to be extremely boring and at a point switched from hard to easy, so I could kill off the Androids and chase off the Alien with the flamethrower more often. And often the alien will STILL hit you for half your life (on easy), before running off. There goes another medkit..

You will return to the same places over and over. After gadget upgrades you can open previously locked doors, and you WILL HAVE to go through those doors. Less new, more of the same corridors. And its basically all just corridors of a space station, looking very similar to one another.

The Alien can't just be killed off. It can just be chased off with the flamethrower (and maybe other weapons). But it will return soon and it doesn't look like its actually taking any damage. It's basically invincible until you reach a certain story point.

There are many, many buttons to press, levers to pull, machines to operate, computer logs to read and more minigames. In between that, you sit around and WAIT until the alien (the androids, the ""civilians"") leaves for a few seconds, so you can operate that thingy and get further in the story. This will repeat itself to exhaustion.

Towards the end the game tries to kill you off in about a hundred different ways, as everything escalates in some sort of cheap action movie finish. Up to scenes where you open a door, make a step and then die, squashed to bits. Next time wait a few seconds before making that step. And on that goes.

All in all I cannot recommend this game to anyone but the most diehard stealth game fans, who don't mind a challenge and who enjoy repeating the same few corridors over and over, until they don't get caught. I personally have other games to play and I'm glad this one is over."

(If they had they would have known the Aliens are not invincible)

All the hype with this and Oculus Rift was just another way for them to gain sales and it was not even released with support for the Rift what a let down from Sega yet again can they get anything right any more.

I only paid $35 for this @ GreenManGaming 7Days after release and I still feal robed. maybe in a year with some serious patching and updates it will be worth playing. (never been so unhappy with an Alien game as I am with this)

I currently can not recomend this game to anyone in its current state this may change with some updates / fix's.

This may actualy be good on a monitor but that is not how I want to run this, it may also be better if you have an Intel CPU with the Rift as I understand it currently the head tracking only works for those with Intel CPU's. (Now I understand why Sega relseased it with out supporting the Rift they wanted to push out thier unfinished broken game now and get some coin rather than finishing thier product typical of todays games developers yet another thing done wrong Sega you shoulda waited).

It was reviewed in the demoed in the Rift (and boy were those reviews awesome) that is the game I wanted shame on you Sega.

I will keep trying and when I do have this game working as it was shown off and reviewed before launch maybe then ill change my review.

Thankyou to those who commented on here b4 your suggestions have helped me to write a better / more accurate review.

I gave up and played on a monitor after building a new rig (i7 4790K 32GB RAM 2 GTX970 Sli)
and all I have to say is OMFG WOW what a POS game sooooooooooo many jagged edges.
forcing the display driver to do 16x AA does nothing what a horiffic mess.

2118,3,0.5031,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I would love to recommend this game, but sadly I just cannot...

There have been at least 3 occasions trying to play through it where I almost gave up completely and uninstalled it.

The Graphics are great, probably the best I have seen in a game so far, and there is a game in there somewhere trying to get out. In the initial few sections I was really enjoying the game, and it managed to build a good sense of suspense. But then sadly it all crumbled away to be replaced with pure frustration - the idiotic save game system coupled with the bizare AI of the alien combine to make some sections just plain stupid.

Dying repeatedly to causes outside your control, meaning that you keep repeating the same small section over and over again, soon disipates any sense of imersion in the game. Indeed I have lost count of the number of times I was just left swearing at the developers for producing such absolute crap...

Still I have almost got to the end, and I will persevere for a little longer...

So at the end of they day, my recommendation is to wait till it turns up as a real bargin in the sales, and then only buy it if you have bucket loads of patience.

I will come back and ammend this _IF_ I ever get to the end of the game."

2123,3,0.4895,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","If you enjoy your game experience to primarily consist of looking for different ways to get through doors, then welcome to Alien Isolation.

This game is pretty, not in a next gen kind of way, but decent enough. Texture work is very homogenous and neat. The overall style does a good job being true to parts of the Alien movie. The visuals is clearly the game strongest suit.

It must be played in the dark with headphones to result in the occasional jolt and scare, and it does succeed in this aspect from time to time! A delightful experience. How ever this game is not a horror game. The Alien walks around like a human on two legs most of the time. It´s simply not scary.

Game mechanics is the weakness of this game. The minigames are ridiculous and the crafting and item usage largely do not matter to survival on the medium difficulty beyond the medkit. Weapons are useless and once you get the flamethrower the last shred of fear of the Alien dissipates. The stealth mechanic is broken beyond repair and the Alien AI is very rudimentary.

I will recommend this game when it hits the sub 10 EUR mark, and only for people who really appreciate Alien visuals and long sequences of getting from point A to point B to press button C to get through door D ad nauseum.

In short the game is a failure as a game, however for the avid fan it is entertaining enough a third of the way. After that the games feel like a laboreous chore. Seeing the game as a vaguely interactive movie helps the experience."
2124,1,0.6463,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Not liking it so far, and not because I get scared easily.

Enemy human AI, at least in the bit I was in, after you run into the tram elevator thingy, tends to be quite broken.
It's super scripted at first, which isn't good already, but the game either forces you to crouch, or when you do crouch it keeps you from standing back up and running. which is a problem, because that chick is scripted to shoot at you. I tried to back up and run down the steps to create some elevation difference/cover, which it wouldn't let me, so I got damaged from a scripted event that wasn't my fault. Later when the AI come down to search, they didn't know I was back there again, so I spent half an hour looking for a way around, then went all the way back across the level to explore, and THEN it let me left click and melee. Somehow, one of these enemies that NEVER left the room before, heard me melee the air and ended up behind me in no less than 10 seconds. So I ran, as I was being shot. I went into a closet once I was out of LOS, little did I know that holding your breath was a mechanic, and the QTE thing only popped up for literally, half a second. I died.
So I redid that bit, did a rewire panel and turned on air purification so that ended up making THICK SMOKE COME OUT OF THE VENTS. Somehow, the AI instantly found me and started shooting me through said smoke and killed me.
SO I REDED THAT BIT, AGAIN. This time, without doing that, I went into this back room after another AI was about to fully spot me. turns out there was another guy in that room with a gun, he saw me and started shooting so I rushed and melee'd him. NOONE HEARD THAT. NOONE.
They could hear me walking. See me across a room in the dark. Hear my melee attack in the air across the map(that general area) at least 100 feet away. See me and kill me through thick smoke. YET. A guy shoots a gun about 45 feet away and noone hears it. Plus there's a window in that brightly lit room where the person who almost saw me outside, should have seen me in that room.

Also it'd be nice if the Alien was either organic through the whole game, or it flat out tells you in a pop up when it starts being like that. There have been points where I thought I had to hunker down and hide, and it turns out the AI up to this point is scripted, and that can't happen yet. I get it's supposed to be scary, but it halts progress up until that point for some people.

Another thing is cutscene audio IS FULL VOLUME, even when my other audio settings are down. Make the cutscene volume follow the other settings.

I don't feel like fixing my typos right now so whatever. I may fix them and/or change my rating and whatnot later, if the game improves, but so far I'm not impressed. Note: I was never on this games hype train. Same for Destiny. I see it how it is, I don't think a game is good to try and justify my purchase. I see it how it is, and call it that way.

Go ahead, hate on me for having valid points with my experience of the game. Go ahead and call me negative when I reply negatively towards all the unwarranted hate.
What goes around comes around, and what's coming around is a bunch of assholes who jumped on the hype train and are unwilling to take criticism towards their ""perfect"" game.
By all means though, go ahead and make this community hub look even more immature."

First of my time recorded is not how long i have played it,most of the time i went offline was so that i would not be interupted by friends.

The pros:
The game looks beautful.
Good at building up atmosphere. 
good crafting system.

Cons:
The aliens,humans and androids AI is bad.
The AI will use cheating methods to kill you 
predictable story 
weapons are useless.

Ok this one is just my opinion but i did wish that i could at lest hurt the alien or trap it, but nope you cant it has the mighty God mode .Which killed the great atmosphere it had, i mean you have a flamethrower and what you cant burn the alien?

i would recomend if it went on sale for 50% at best but at the price it is now i just cant recomend it.


Or just get Space station 13 and play xeno round its basicly the same thing."
2127,3,0.6408,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","First the good parts. The graphics are very good the soundtrack takes a lot of hints from the movies, the whole alien athmosphere is great. The minigames are fresh, and the movement is quite good, with the exception that you can't really jump, not even over the smallest obstacles. In short, the assets and aesthetics of the game ARE GREAT.

Unfortunalty, the gameplay is nearly catastrophic. The player is powerless, the alien is all mighty and can sense your presence everywhere. A lot of your equipment (noise maker e.g.) does  not work as intended, and does not turn away the alien. You die constantly, without the feeling of doing something wrong.

I finished the game on hard and got the achievement to prove it.

I don't like this title, it suffers from bad game mechanics. The player is powerless, and there are too many go here, now go there missions."
2128,3,0.4161,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","To start I want to say that I did enjoy this game, it had alot of good elements, and a very compelling storyline, however its pros, do not really outweight its cons, at least for the current price of the game. (first sale price)

The main thing this game had going for it is its fandom, the aliens genra has always had a huge following and easily draws them in with pretty much any game they make for it, be it a game as fantastic as Aliens vs predator, or as terrible as colonial marines. That being said the game has many other elements that do make it rather enjoyable to play.

For example the visuals in the game are wonderful, clearly taking current graphic technology and putting it to work to give us a fanominal show of what games today can really do. Despite there being a few copy paste feeling locations where they had the same drinking bird in every room you went into, you could clearly still feel uniquness in every area of the station you go, from being a crowded resedential section, to a industrialized engineering bay you really felt like you were there, at least visually.

Lets not forget the story alone for this game is compelling enough stuff, driving you on further and further through the game, just to see what happens next. you really get connected with riply and want to see what her mother left behind and try to keep her alive long enough to enjoy what she finds. the characters are compelling and you grow to love, and hate some of them, though admitidely some of the characters in the game only have extremely small cameos only to be forgoten completely a few seconds later. 

Which leads us into the cons for this game, to start simply put, some of the story, though compelling, felt forced. The story as a whole was great to follow, however some of the characters, or even the situations you got into, simply made no sense at all, you would seem to get really attached to 1 character, but then never see or hear from them again but for only 1 brief small moment somewhere much further down the line, like your suppsed to care about this character and what happens to them, which just simply isnt the case since there was no connection to begin with.

Despite those few flaws in the story however it was still in my opinion, good. However the stories flaws were not my main driving decision to not recommend this to others. My primary concern with the game was with the gameplay itself. Though to start with there was that element of fear, not knowing when or if the alien would come from the walls, what awaited you around the corner, it was a rush. but almost litterally after the first encounter with the alien, the fear was gone, other then a few very small jumpy moments when the alien would randomly kill you, there was no real fear of the alien. In fact after the first real death to the alien you pretty much learned that once he came at you, it was over and there wasnt anything you could do to really stop it, so you kinda just sat back and let it happen cuse why fight it.

The alien itself was completely unpredicatble, and honestly far to buggy and way to easy for you to die to it. If the alien sees you at all, hears you, senses you, your basically dead, you might be able to scare it off with fire, or explosives, but honestly that was more often just delaying the inevitable. it would be back in about 5 seconds, and know exactly where you were no matter where you were. Not to mention half the time hiding didnt even work, and even holding your breath and leaning back, did you no good against the alien and it just kill you wile you hide in a locker. This isnt also to mention the alien seems to randomly see you at times from across the map and come rushing right at you, and your only warning is the loud stomps of its foot steps. what made the alien worse I felt was that it almost always ignored the other threats in the game, completely ignoring the android threats in the game, which confused the hell outa me because the alien and the androids practically would just stand at stare at each other at times.

Which brings me to the other issue I had with the game, the combat system. I realize this game is supposed to be more about survival fear etc etc. but they added this combat feature to the game for a reason, and honestly its almost compeltely worthless. For starters, it takes about 4 shots if that to kill you, and though that is understandable, it doesnt make sense that its the same for every weapon, a shotgun or a pistol all deal the same damage no matter what, and that makes no sense to me, though in your hands, it does more? Not to mention the fact that these other threats only serve pretty much to get you killed since the second you fire your gun, the alien is pretty much right on top of you, though if they fire, the alien never comes and even when it does, it almost always ignores them and goes right for you. Ammo is never an issue in the game since 1 shot kills almost everything except for the androids, which I might add are the most retarded threat in the game.

First of all they are slow as hell, so even when they do see you, you can pretty much just walk around them, killing them is next to impossible without either an emp grenade, shotgun, or stun baton. and for some weird reason they somehow magically become even stronger later on in the game when they start waring rubber suits, because somehow a rubber suit suddenly makes something stronger for some reason. (though they give you a weapon with just enough ammo to kill every rubber suited android in 1 shot, conveint wouldnt you say?) Finally, I have to wonder about the guns in the game, to me really adding guns kind of ruined the feel for me, because really a gun can kill the alien, pretty easily, and considering every person and their mother on this station is carring around either some kind of giant ass revolver, or a shotgun, I have to wonder how the alien is still alive after the ammout of bullets it has to have taken from the people its killed.

To close I did enjoy this game for its story and extremely wonderful visuals, but the actual gameplay elements for the game just fell really short for me, alot of it didnt make sense, and even more of it was either just to conveniant or it was just out of place and didnt flow naturally. I would recommend the game at 20$ or less, but currently, I simply cant justify anyone buying this game at its current price."

Good graphics and sounds. Waste of money."
2135,2,0.4256,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","First off, the good elements of the game: It captures the feel of the original alien movie very well. It is genuinely tense in many parts due to the atmospheric audio and sound track. The graphics side of things are also quite impressive, the game is fairly nice to look at. However my expereince so far of the game is overall disapointing.  It is by no means a bad game, but it does not quite live up to the expectations. My biggest complaints are as follows:

Firstly, you learn very quickly that the game is a console port. As a result the control of your charcter in the game does not feel as sharp as a pc game should. However this is a fairly minor complaint and the game does allow you to turn off aim assist to limit the horrible feel of a console game. 

Secondly, and probably one of the biggest problems I had with this game are the enemy characters and the AI. The game features not just a big scary alien, but also hostile human and synthetic enemies. I first encountered the armed human enemies who I decided to try and avoid as this stealthy style of game play seemed to be what the game was all about. This method worked fairly well most of the time, but when I found myself in one situation where I needed to get passed a room full of eneimes I failed every time. I kept getting discovered and gunned down wether I used distrations or tried different routes when trying to sneak passed. I lured all my enemies and hid in a vent, but rather than continuing on with thier search they all gathered arouned the door near the vent I was in as if they knew they couldn't attack me because they hadn't techinically found me yet, but they also didn't look any further past where I was hiding making it impossible to slip by. At this point I was so sick and tired of trying the stealth approach that I leapt out of the vent and charged my hunters with the crow bar like weapon. They all noticed me and raised their guns but since they were all standing so closed to eachother only the enemy directly in front would attempt to attack me. The others just stood there waiting thier turn while I slowly clubbed each one to death. In the end I mananged to fairly easily take out 4 guys with guns by myself with a crow bar.

On that point, the guns. After killing all my armed enemies I naturally thought, woo I can hoard all thier shiny new guns. However I was wrong, the game only allows you to kick the guns around on the floor that have been dropped by your conquered enemies. You have to wait untill you get to the room with the special gun just for you because apparaently that is the only weapon you know how to pick up.

So from this I learned that the AI in this game was not necessarily as intelligent as the sales pitch made out. Next I encounted the android or synthetic enemies. There was a moment where you are hiding in a vent and the game shows you a random person being attacked and killed by a synthetic. This I figured was the game telling me, ""ok so the synthetics will attack you now ok?"" However since by this point I had a gun I decided to have a crack at one I found by himself. I shot the robot in the back of his head which understandably provoked him. However no matter how many more bullets I unloaded into his face he didn't go down. When he finally cornered me I discovered they the synthetics are also capable of catching almost every hit with the crow bar making it useless to attack them as well. I know these characters are supposed to be robots not people, but why give me weapons at all? This encapsulates my main problem with this game over all. The game is difficult in a really lazy way. You get weapons and guns and the like only to find out that in order to stop you being rambo, the game simply turns off the effect of these weapons on most of the enemies. Robots come at you even if you fired enough bullets that they should no longer have a head. However this lazy neutering of the weapons is worst of all with the feature character of the game, the alien.

Obviously you can't just kill the alien because there is only 1. However, during my first few encounters with the creature which were actually quite tense I always managed to sneak past him. Finally howver there was a moment when he saw me from the other end of a long hall way and immediately charged towards me. I pulled out my selectively useful revolver and fired off round after round thinking I could distract or stun the monster for a moment to make my escape. However the alien wasn't too bothered and charaged straight on at me. In fact my bullets didn't even seem to exist when fired at the alien. Literally, there was no impact animation or anyhting on the alien it was as though I was firing blanks. The game essentially says, 'no you can't kill the alien so we are just going to turn your guns off when you use them against our baby"" It really feels as though the guns, or at least the ones that fire bullets, are in the game specifically for use against the other human enemies only. Again this game is by no means bad, just not as good as it could have been or as it was marketed to be. You quickly become aware of the limitations and controls the game places over you so that you play the way it wants rather than how you want.

"
2136,3,0.488,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I was really looking forward to this game, as i'm a fan but I'm sorry to say it's not up to the hype that's been reported on some of the gaming sites. It starts off well, very atmospheric but it became apparent that the alien AI in parts was just as 'nostalgic' as the graphics.
"
2137,3,0.4164,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","For people wondering if they should buy the game, wait for a sale. The story is decent, the gameplay is mediocre and easily the worst part, the visuals are a very mixed bag with anti aliasing that doesn't work and some animation problems and some actual visual glitches and sound glitches.

The biggest problem with the enjoyability of this game has to do with the padding combined with the excessive use of the alien. The alien has some really rough edges in it's AI, animation, and how it functions in general. Most of the game is hiding from the alien and performing extremely mundane tasks that are more tedious than they are creative in their design. This creates a very unenjoyable experience. These ""chores"" you have to do to advance from story bit to story bit are extremely mundane and it all ends up repeating. There is little variation to how you can hide from the alien, and there is little variation in the objectives you are accomplishing. Simply exploring the atmosphere of the game being free to pick up logs and such and much less forced use of the alien, either in favor of quiet or androids would have worked great, as androids cause more interesting gameplay to come into play (where the involved mechanics are often dead content since you can't use them on the alien), and since they can be killed you can at least get them out of the way.

Most of the mechanics of the game go to utter waste to the point of being dead content. Survivors are no threat when the alien is around since as soon as they start shooting they doom themselves to the alien, and you are doomed if you engage the survivors while in their proximity or are downwind from the alien coming to murder them (and you). Most of the stuff you pick up becomes worthless quickly and starts piling up. The AI of the alien is sometimes painfully arbitrary or completely ambiguous, or a combination of both, which is extremely confusing. Sometimes it will go upon rigid patrol paths where it never ceases and sometimes being quiet seems to work. In all this ""thumping around"" the alien does you just want to explore the level and get to your next objective, and it starts to become clear that this game is going to drag on long and loud.

The combat mechanics are decent at least, and fighting androids and surivors by themselves or at least next to a much less sensitive alien would have been far more satisfying and less annoying in terms of gameplay, and in favor of preserving the horror element of the alien, which is completely lost up until the tense moments of late game where the story hits a crescendo.

Something needs to be said about QTEs, FOV, gadget minigames, and Melee. The very last section of the game should have been decided as a cinematic, or actual gameplay. Nobody digs that kind of nonsense. Decide between the two or go home. Powering generators should have been the same as opening lever doors, as that feels more satisfying and mashing E is annoying and makes less sense. Activating melee should not lock your movement and camera, and should not alter the FOV, that was extremely annoying. Gadget minigames could have been more creative, they seem really artificial. Also, unique puzzles were nowhere to be found. All objectives are extremely regurgitated gadget minigames, minor QTEs, and hide and seek. 
A minor gripe is that activating electronics through the keyboard interface should have been reduced to scrolling to the right setting with the arrow keys and press y or n. This makes more sense and you could even let the player do it rather than through a cinematic. In fact, this kind of already exists, so that should have been used instead rather than the ""random typing"" cinematic at least, as it's obvious and annoying how generic the typing is (it's recycled key presses, or a few kinds of recycled key presses from what it looks like).

Now that I’ve played though the game here’s how I would have worked with the existing mechanics of the game to make it better.
The introduction of the game should have been more “isolated.” In an abandoned and separated part of the station ripley would be far more alone, the alien would be used much more sparingly in favor of androids, and have no access to anything remotely offensive except for that wrench and EMP.


Medium level spoiler from here


When the aliens are introduced the player gains increasing offensive means, and aliens can be interrupted, scared away, and now even wounded and killed. These means are extremely limited early on. And how about a nice assault rifle at some point as a nice throwback to aliens, and an awesome sense of empowerment? Just because you can wound or kill aliens doesn’t always mean it’s a good idea, also, they bleed acid.
This isn’t less terrifying, it’s just differently terrifying. The “horde” itself is still a terrifying threat, and so is the prospect of not being able to fend it off.
The story structure would function almost exactly the same, and then at the end you’ll lose your weapons so the very end makes sense.
So now the game would be paying homage to the original and it's sequel aliens. Even better. In the first section of the game the alien seems invincible, but offensive means aren't introduced to cast doubt. When weapons are introduced you are then able to fight back, and to make it interesting, the game won't tell you, and fighting back is difficult but at least possible to get rid of the huge gripe of canon contradiction, which is that the aliens are not invulnerable.

Perhaps they’ll apply this to the sequel. The story and atmosphere itself is great when it isn't marred by the sheer blight of the gameplay of hide and seek, and the gigantic plothole of the invulnerability applied to the alien."

Disclaimer: This review is based on a mixture of a new release price tag, and all of the flase things that Creative Assembly was boasting. (surprise surprise)

This game is beautiful. The sound and music are also on point. It's a very immersive environment that explores more of the Alien universe lore. I remembered watching the movie Aliens and wanting them to expand on Ripley's daughters life while she was in cryo-sleep. Decent crafting, and enough gadgets and weapons to get you by. Please note, this is not a run and gun first person shooter like the millenials keep wanting reskinned versions to play. This is more like Outlast or Prenumbra set in the Alien universe. Do not run in shooting everywhere or you will die. It's a survival game, not a hop around firing rocket launchers game.

Now the bad. I can't stress enough, I got it yesterday, and was having fun with it the first few hours. However, I began noticing things. CA boasted that the alien possessed super duper state of the art artificial AI, (sound like another game they released last year?) but the alien actually spawns and teleports around the map near your vicinity. I've found myself hiding from him in a locker, and he just roams around the room, or the halls outside so you eventually have to get out of the locker and let him get you so you can reload your save and try again, and after reloading he's nowhere to be found. 

There was one point where I was moving down a corridor, and there were 3 open ceiling vents above, and you can tell where he's at because you see a stream of drool dripping down onto the floor. I skirted around said vent so he couldn't grabe me, and guess what? The rain of drool immediately appeared in the 2nd, and then 3rd vent after that. These vents were not connected to each other, so how did he immediatly appear in the next one? If he knew where I was, why didn't he just drop down and kill me? (You can't outrun him if he sees you) Again, his ""A.I."" doesn't seem intelligent, just random spawning and cheap kills. 

I've watched him spot me from down the hall, run after me, and I made it into a room and hid in the locker.  He was RIGHT behind me at this point but once the locker door closed, he just turned and walked out.

I've seen him walk past a human NPC that wasn't even sneaking and continue searching for me while I was hiding under a desk. Neither him nor the NPC acknoweledge one anothers presence. 

I have rarely felt like I've been outsmarted by this sophisticated A.I.. It mainly feels random and cheap when he finds me. 

The human enemy A.I. is just a series of talking to each other and patrolling a set path while having predator like vision that can spot you crouching in the dark from 100 meters away and snipe you with a pistol somehow. 

A challenging game doesn't bother me, but I'm 34 and been a gamer for 29 years ever since my parents bought me my first NES. I can tell the difference between a challenging game and just random good/bad luck. 

Overall, the lore so far seems good, and the visuals are stunning, but I really wish modern game developers would focus on gameplay as opposed to flashy graphics to hold the attention of ritalin addled kids. 

It's worth getting, but I'd wait until it's 20-30 dollars because I don't think it will be worth more than a 1 time playthrough.

2141,3,0.464,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Honestly? I didn't enjoy this game. I'm a massive coward and jeez, the first jumpscare in Outlast with the TV clicking on and screaming at you got me four times in a row because I kept forgetting about it, but this game? I really don't see what people are so afraid about. I played for something just short of 2.5 hours and just never really got scared...like, at all. I really don't understand what about this game is getting it all these rave reviews unless it's something to do with it being the first *acceptable* Alien game in a while. Maybe it gets better later into it but in my opinion if you make a game and claim it to be a Horror genre game and in the first two hours you haven't scared ME of all people then I think you've done something wrong. I really can't recommend this game as something for people who enjoy scary games because to me it just...wasn't. Alot of people give that game praise for it's audio and graphical work and I'll put an opinion on that as well. No. It does not deserve the praise it gets, here's why: Graphics - the game's graphical style was based heavily on the first Alien film, and done so in the goal of putting players in an environment that was as close to that film as possible, and in this it excels. The game's technology and design of its architecture and just general look is very very similar to the film. However, does this make the graphics good? No. I have always said that quality of graphics come second to aesthetic efficiency for the game, this is something unique to the medium. However, in this case a better quality graphic choice might have done something good for the game, as the game currently has the graphical quality of the late seventies film that it was based off of. Which hurts it. Badly. As far as audio goes? That's a big no from me as well. The audio track in this game is full of the creaks and groans of the busted ass space station that it takes place on with the orchestral accompaniment for moments fraught with tension and the game was sold with a pretty big hint that sound would play a big part in the player's survival. Does Isolation deliver on this claim like it did on its graphic claim? Not really. The game IS filled with the mechanical failure of the station, but this left me more confused as to what was actually a sound that mattered versus just some bumfuck piece of the station complaining at me. After a while it became background noise as I came to the conclusion that it didn't matter. At one point the orchestra floating beside my head made everything unbearable as I was caught between it on one side and a severely annoying alarm on the other which initially gave me my only moment of possible fright in the game which got quickly annihilated as I realized that I was just being screamed at and that I wasn't at risk at all. This became a running theme in my two plus hours of play. I would come into a new situation, have a few things happen that MIGHT be threatening but then I came to the conclusion that I wasn't at risk(wasn't a hard conclusion to reach) and my terror completely melted before it even formed. The one time I died was because a human, a HUMAN, across a room from me magically saw me in the dark, shot me, I ran, she followed, I hid in a vent, then she magically saw me through the closed vent door, and fired before the vent had even finished opening. I can't advise anyone who enjoys a good scary game to play this because it's just not scary. And don't even get me started on the damned titular alien. This is a personal thing, but with a fair amount of truth to it as well. One thing that alot of people praise the game for is the animation and AI for the xenomorph. The xenomorphs, in every medium and every representation, have been shown to look a thousand times more natural on all fours. Anytime you see one moving on two legs it looks...wrong. Something about their walking just looks ragged and incorrect. Put them on all fours though and they're climbing walls, running along floors, leaping across rooms. They just never look right trying to walk on two legs, no matter what form of media. Giger and Scott knew that when they made the first film, that's why you never see the guy in the suit running across the damned camera! That suit was awkward as fuck to walk in, there's documented evidence to that. So why in all these games do we keep seeing them on two legs with glitchy ass walk cycles? The animation for the xenomorph in Isolation is on par with fucking Colonial Marines. There, it's said. It's THAT bad. Go look at it and tell me otherwise. Now, combine that with an AI that's just as likely to wander right past you versus magically see you and murder you while some gameplay element keeps you vulnerable for way too damned long just to be extra difficult and kill you in the middle of a save attempt and you get a piss poor experience. The one time I saw the xenomorph walking outside of a cutscene/in-game cinematic I fell out of my chair laughing at the damned thing. Then, it just ran off and disappeared. No threat, no fear, just a dumb ass walk cycle. There's a bunch of other things I could go on about but honestly I don't know if it's worth the time. That game is a pretty big disappointment, although I don't know if that's the right word as I walked in without any expectations, so that ought to tell you it's fairly bad. It just doesn't deliver what people kept saying it would deliver and from what I've heard it's not likely that my playing the game any further would change my opinion. I've uninstalled it and I'm certainly glad that I didn't spend money to get it because I'd probably be pretty damned pissed if I had. Final score/opinion summary: Good features, good idea, poor execution, lack of delivery on promises. 4/10, and that's being charitable."

Warning, these are my personal opinions on the game. And in this case they are very negative opinions. If you read this and love the game, keep loving the game. I do not hold that against you. It is an Alien game most will love.

I had high hopes for it, and maybe thats why im left here with more negative things to say about it than i have positive. 

The beginning of the game is very slow, the first hour is basically a slow build up learning you the controls and the mechanics of the game, of which there aren’t very many. The control mappings are fine on both keyboard and controller. However the feel of motion is sluggish, sort of like you are moving through molasses, even your run feels kind of awkward and too slow. 

You will be represented with a space station to walk around, where you will carry out many tedious tasks. Which often revolve around the same things, like powering up sub-systems, finding a keycard, finding a new tool that will let you open a new set of doors, and a ton of backtracking. In Between those segments, you pretty much play a hide and seek game, combined with a walking simulator.

You will come across other humans in that time, but it usually always ends in a gunfight if they spot you. As it seems no one are interested in working together or just letting you walk by with no hassle. You do have the option to bypass or let the Alien sort them out. 

Then there are the androids, which are equally as hostile and are best bypassed altogether if possible, as it takes a metric snot ton of bullets to take them out. And don't even try to wrench them they will grab you each time, unless you manage to sneak up on them and get some good shots in. Again androids best avoided.

And finally there is the Alien(s), the center piece or at least it should have been.  I thought it would have a big impact on the game. I was kind of wrong about that one. It doesn't really add any tension to the game, at least it didn’t for me. Maybe because it showed up so much, seeing it over and over makes you accustomed to it and unafraid of it. Plus you will know what to expect and what to do each time.

It really added an annoyance in the fact that it would make me have to wait to carry out my mission to an extent it actually added a comical value too, the AI on it is kind of stupid. Sometimes it would actually see me, but it will be stuck in its hide in vent animation, and wouldn’t be able to break that cycle. 

Then there is the issue of even though you will be crouching most of this game, the Alien oddly have the ability to just keep on you at all times, even though you left it in another room like 2 meters back, it will and can emerge just as you enter a new room like all the way in the back of the next room. This even happen when you transit from one part of the station to another. Like it has its own personal teleportation device, or maybe its just psychic?

The save system is just like the one found in say Dead Space. Though in Dead Space it actually worked without any issues. Here it seems to only serve the purpose of adding additional down time for more opportunities to get attacked and to interrupt your save. You can literally die before you manage to save, as there is no backing out of the save animation.

To save you need to find a save station, wait for the terminal to light up 3 lights, which takes around 5 seconds. And then you can hit the save button. It feels very archaic, and i get why some people are frustrated with it. Especially if they have lost 30 minutes of play time and have to backtrack. While in the meantime the Alien AI can completely hump you over again. I know that the game would lose difficulty if you could just quick save, but it's kind of appalling that you can get a cut scene and you would think that the game automatically would save your game after the cut scene ends. But it doesn’t. I’m actually still not sure when the game saves by it self.

This is a game you either love or loathe. I count myself as a big Alien fan, love the movies and i have watched them so many times. That doesn't mean that i have to give this game a pass though. It has flaws, and for me it has a lot of them.

On a positive note, the graphics are really awesome. They nailed the look of the movies, down to the smallest details. Sound design is for the most part really good aswell. There is a few minor things like not all voice actors are very good, and that the motion tracker is not using the iconic sound from the movies. But overall in the sound and graphics department its pretty damn solid. It is a bit of a shame though that really good set pieces only happen when you are over halfway through the game. There are some really striking locations near the end of the game.

I would only recommend this if you wouldn’t mind any of the negative things i have listed above and a few random deaths on top of that.

Self proclaimed Alien elitists will be happy with anything, i mean those people love Alien: Colonial Marines and find no faults with it. So if you are one of those go for it, nothing will change your view on it in the first place.

Bottom line for me, i regret buying it. And i regret writing all this nonsense.

Graphics are awesome, as well as the ambience and music, even the few gadgets you can use. BUT, PLAYABILITY SUCKS.
Not the kind of Alien I was expecting. You cannot fight the alien !!!. Your weapons are just for humans.

Any enemy in this game has a deadly sight. They can spot on you from far away and, from any position (upper or lower floor, by example). A couple of bullets and you are dead. There is no way to pass unperceived so, you end confronting them and, here there is one more stupid thing: you kill one enemy that carries a weapon and YOU CANNOT take his/her weapon!!!.

One more thing I don't like, too much buttons to perform stupid repeatitive actions, as open a locked door and so on. It adds nothing to the game.

Once you have a gun, the alien continously chases you. It doesn't matter what you do, if you walk, run or crouch: the alien always spots on you and, once it does it, you are simply dead.
To pass 90% of the gameplay time inside a closet is just frustating and boring. I could stand this for a while, until you get a good weapon to fight the alien but, this never happens.

If you run, you alarm the alien (well, it's in constant alarm mode and always close to you). So, you need to walk or crouch, which makes the gameplay slow, slow, slooooooooooowwwwwww.

I'm really disapointed, they did a perfect job with graphics, characters, music and overall ambientation, very close to how the Nostromo starship looked like in the film but, the gameplay design ruined some game that could had been unbeatable.

2153,3,0.5191,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","[spoilers] Okay, watching the trailers for this game, and the hype was amazing, and made me want to play this more than anything in the world! This game seemed like it would be 10/10. 

Then I started playing it. 

Don't get me wrong, the beginning of this game was phenomenal. The lighting was 10/10 (besides the fact that you can't even see your own shadow, but I'll let that one slide), the lighting really made you feel like you were holding a flashlight, and holding real flares, a flame thrower, etc. 

The Voice Acting to me, personally, was phenomenal. BUT the lip-sync of the characters to voice was awful, it's like they didn't even try. Sometimes they wouldn't move their lips while talking, sometimes they would move their lips and not be talking, and sometimes they didn't even ""move"" their lips they just moved their jaw to ""produce sound"". 5/10

The graphics were phenomenal. I loved the way the fire looked, loved the animations when you used a medikit, or reloaded a weapon, or hell, even started a generator, that was amazing, the motion capture was incredible. It constantly had me saying ""Wow that's f***ing awesome"" 10/10

BUT the story to the game is where the game gets ruined. The story just kept getting extended for no reason at all. You would feel like you're about to finish the game (example being: you are in an Alien Nest with hundreds of them around you, and suddenly you need to burn the entire thing. So you burn it all down, what happens next? Nope, not the ending, about an hour or two of more gameplay) then the game would drag you into some long boring ""Go to this objective and do this, oh now go to this objective and do this"" before actually making the game make you ""Escape"" sure they wanted to make it intense and suspenseful, but it ended up making me more pissed off than anything. Here I am trying to play this amazing game, but about half-way through I start to ALMOST finish objectives then FALL THROUGH A FLOOR, or THE ELEVATOR DOESNT WORK, or some stupid stuff like that. When I was at the Airlock near the end of the game, and the alien grabbed me, I almost stopped playing because that is the stupidest shit ever. THEN you run through the entire area again, just to get into your ship thing, and get attacked by aliens. But they don't just jump on you like the stalking alien THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE GAME, instead they kinda just walk around, look at you, THEN jump, but somehow you're alive, which makes no sense. THEN you get into your ship looking for verlaine, and SOMEHOW THE ALIEN IS IN THERE AS WELL, and SAME THING doesn't attack you immediately, instead you have to use Move Keys to move away from it, but STILL DIE AT THE END, what the fuck is the point of that! Story: 2/10

Speaking of elevators not working, how come half of the doors say ""Need Power"" and the other have are completely okay to go through. I can understand the doors that lead to nowhere, but these doors lead places, and sometimse those 'Places' only open after you complete half of the game, and you need to backtrack to get there, for some acheivement or something. 

The way the game saved the game was shitty as well, sometimes you would find a save point, RIGHT BEFORE a cut scene then have to do the cutscene all over again. THAT was annoying.

Then there was the massive amounts of bugs and glitches in the game, game crashes, falling through floors, not being able to do objectives because they glitch on the map, etc.

The game really fucking got annoying quite quickly after about half way through. 

In Conclusion: It didn't seem like they had ANY PERSON on the team actually play through the game and give feedback, OR even give out a copy to people to play through and give a review, because I'm pretty certain if someone that wasn't the LEAD (Insert title here) would give this game a shitty review too. 

This game is good for the scares, until about halfway through the game, then it just gets annoying. Would I recommend it? I WOULD until about half way through the game. Sorry guys, this is my first negative review ever. Also, first negative review on a Triple A game as well... such a shame that this game went to rubbish.

The scripted events that drive the plot are not always succesful as the first apperance of Alien is absolutely untriggered or at least anticipitated and only rides on the magnificence of Alien, that is seemingly cloak and dagger sort of creature that you later encounter as merely vegetable drooling down the ventilation shafts at preset points  and the predicament is easily recognizable for they're dettered by the might of androids whose purpose is unclear as the plot goes because you'll be the one to perform dull maintenance tasks which androids supposedly can't with point being made about their stupidity although to not make them redundant they're evil in a sense that without cause they brake the laws of android programming through antagonized killing of even corporate management it appears.

2155,3,0.4253,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I can't recommend this game as it stands. I was really hoping to like it and I'm sure I will if they can fix it up.

But as it is, the aliasing in the picture is horrible. If you don't mind jaggies in your games go ahead, but if you're like me and consider them the unforgivable graphical sin, you may want to hold off a few weeks to see if they can fix it.

Its ruining the immersion for me in the dark scenes right now.

I'm playing it on the highest settings I can find on an R9 280x and other graphical aspects are great. Its smooth and immersive... Until you see something with some edges on it. The SMAA T2X antialiasing setting appears to be the best of a horrible bunch. Forcing AA in drivers appears to do nothing, I can't seem to get it going with SweetFX but that may help me get a better result if I can. 

Not that I should have to go to any lengths to get a good result. Call me unreasonable but I don't think a AAA game in 2014 should exhibit any visible aliasing on reasonable hardware and correct settings. I know they wanted to make the game look 1979 but this is going too far! (Kudos on making it look so much like Alien, like I say other aspects of the look of the game are great)

Note: Some players seem to be reporting the aliasing being not too bad on various forums, so your experience may be different to mine, but there are plenty of folks in my boat too. The boat where it looks bad enough that you want to stop playing in the hopes you might get to enjoy the game properly later.

EDIT: I seem to have better results winding Anisotropic Filtering back to Bilinear in the game and forcing it within my Catalyst Drivers instead. Better texture sharpness and somehow less aliasing. I also have AA in game set to SMAAT2X and driver set to enhance application with 8x AA. It may be helping.

People have reported that turning Vsync off in the game and forcing it in drivers improves things but I haven't seen a difference. Oh and increase V-FOV to 55, any more and your arms and legs disapear 

I have the game looking good enough to play (aliasing is still bad) but can't recommend, because you shouldn't need to go to these lengths to get it looking acceptable."

Video: 8/10 The lighting and overall atmosphere is great.  However I suspect framerate is locked at 30.  Some cinematic scenes do not flow as well as they could.  Still some clunky edges on occasion.  I noticed some minor animation glitches as well (hands clipping through held objects, et cetera)

Gameplay: 9/10 for first couple hours.  6/10 for next ten hours. 2/10 for remaining ten hours.  This game repeats itself for longer than the SOS beacon on the derelict did.  Holy shit.


First of all, the community for this game is horrendous.  They want to come off as purists, elite gamers yearning for days of yore when games were about content and not multiplayer skill progression.  Which is cool, we all kinda want that.  But this game doesn't have content.  You are a stealth gopher for 20+ hours.  The community instead comes off as a bunch of old assholes who cannot fathom a mix between cinematic, stylized gameplay and heart pumping action.  They seem to be too unsure of their ability to perform underpressure so they would prefer to hide in a locker for probably 5+ hours of gameplay.

I did enjoy this game when I started playing it.  It was very tense, the lighting and sound are phenomenal and help the set the scene.  However, after about ten to twelve hours of doing the same thing I quickly started to realize thie gameplay does not evolve or progress.  Every single ""quest/chapter/mission/objective"" is the same thing... Sneak from point A to point B.
Options?  Plenty!  You can walk down a corridor or shimmy through a vent!  You can hide in a locker or under a desk!  You can pick up ammo for guns that you'll never use!  You can accumulate components to craft items that are almost 100% pointless!  

The game is awesome, it's beautiful.  The storyline is simple and predictive, the voice acting is outstanding.  If you are shocked at the end then you must be a little sheltered and/or simple.

I just can't justify the price point on this game in my mind.  I bought the game and the DLC, a whopping 90 bucks.  Yeah, the game is long... But it FEELS long.  There are times when you just want it to end.  There are times when you just turn it off because its the same thing over and over and over.  In all honesty, the main campaign feels like it should be cut down 80% and used as a chapter of a game as opposed to a stand alone game itself.  They had an opportunity here to create something amazing, but instead created.... meh.  If they would have varied the gameplay a little bit, which they could do without sacrificing story, it could be an awesome survival horror.

As it stands, I would hold off and wait to see what kind of DLC comes out down the road.  If they add different game modes or play styles, maybe give it a shot if it goes on sale.

2159,3,0.5248,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","The first few hours I was completely sold on this game on Atmosphere alone. Their art team has done an excellent job emulating the mood and feel of the original Alien movie.

The game isn't as much scary as it is atmospheric, but I found that it gave away to frustration quickly.

You will die often, and often times it's by a one-hit-kill that you can't do anything about. There's a run button, but running will get you one-hit-killed. If you're not careful you will also walk somewhere you shouldn't have and also get one-hit-killed.

There's hardly any down time either, the alien is in your face almost non-stop. The fantastic environments and the novelty of the enoucounters wear off and all you're left is repetition, replaying the same sections of the game over and over because you keep getting killed and sent back to some save point way back when.

Addendum: I finished the game. Most of the frustration I felt was during the scimed section of the game. It's the one part that drags down the rest of the otherwise phenomenal game.

There are still some parts that still feel horribly unfair, however, like getting killed in the middle of a cutscene/unskippable animation. But for the most part this game is actually not bad."

I was hopeing to enjoy a one on one hunt between the palyer and the alien. In this game we just cant have that, so we have to fight an unstoppable alien(And yes he is scripted in some parts he not completely random), anonnoy Synthetics, and crazy people in general. There was no imersion for the first 2 hours of the game. I dont have the best setup I know my sounds. 
Pros-Great movie/cutscene graphics
       -Original Alien-style design.
       -Beautiful scenery
       -Terrified when I (FINALLY) saw the alien
       -Crafting sytem is nice but felt useless
       -Voice Acting was amazing
       -Stealth is good feature, but the elements were off
Cons-The story doesnt revolve around alien it move the story around Seegson & W-Y
        -Animation in game is static(the Synthetics tacted more like humans than the humans did)
        -The controls are all over the place
        -Not good representation for orginal movie
        -Scares/surprises were triggered poorly(timing was off for jump scares and buildups)
        -Alien death makes the game tedious and ruins atmosphere(I love long single player games, but i hate insta-death)
        -Quick-time events(not all quick-time events are bad it just didnt work here)
        -Lighting phyics were off
        -A.I. Human detection is delayed
        -Felt like Dead Space(it should feel like Aliens not Dead Space)
        -No help(no tutorial to eplain the controls correctly)
        -Motion Sensor didnt detect Androids full time(buggy)
        -Sounds phyics are off (at some points people right next to me sounded far away and vice versa)+No left or right specific sound(sound was just there not in specific ears)
Weird things-Odd thing happen in-game how what I experienced not good nor bad
         -No shadow for player     
         -Human enemy A.I. is more random than alien(random patrols)
         -Floating materials
         -Synthetics also had random patrol pattern that changed after I loaded the ""last current save""
         -Game meant for console?(controls felt awkward)
         -No jump?
         -Motion Sensor detect Androids?

It's got fantastic graphics and the sound is top notch. You get to explore a dark, derelict futuristic environment while the creaks and groans of the space station build a creepy atmosphere. The art is very classy and really captures the feel of the 80's dystopian future of the Alien movies. It's got nice puzzle mechanics and a good story. The intro is very long and sets the scene nicely, giving the player a slow burning feeling of paranoia.

However for some reason it decides to occasionally go down the old tired unrealistic route of making the player hide and sneak past randomly patrolling enemies, exactly the way you've done before in 100 other games. However in this game, all you can really do is avoid enemies so you just have to wait ages for them to randomly wander away from you, or accidentally trigger a scripted event that makes them go do something else. If they spot you, enemies kill you almost instantly so you have to do it all again, trial and error style. The Alien is well designed and well animated, but we've seen it so many times before that it loses some of its magic. 

It's a shame they decided to spoil the overall atmosphere with these annoying sneak-em-up sequences since it doesn't really add anything but length to the game. I'd really like to recommend Alien: Isolation but it falls kind of short of deserving full price. Maybe wait for a sale?"

While graphicaly impressive that is the only positive thing it has for it, it is a bore fest of running down the same hallways to collect keycards to open doors, running back across the station to use a computer, or just running down empty areas with no enemies. Isolation is filled with things that should not exist such as, making you play areas while locking you into walk only mode across 10 - 20 minutes of nothing that should of been a cutscene, walking across a room after a loading screen to get another loading screen.

Did I mention you can craft? Well let's start there. Isolation is filled with items to collect to craft items, some of them are Medkits, Noise Makers, EMP Mine, and Smoke Bombs. Seems like quite the selection, yet you need some deadly enemies to use these and are the enemies deadly? No, in fact all the human enemies you encounter act as if it's against the rules of the game to engage you. Some Synthetic enemies can not be harmed by anything except all of your ammunition, and the Alien can not be harmed at all.

Now, what about that revolutionary Alien A.I.? Well it's anything but revolutionary, it is the most basic seeking A.I. there is.

What about the human enemies? What can I say, it's the same as the Aliens. 

Now the synthetic androids, you will encounter these more then humans and aliens combined! These guys are ruthless in a hunt and will follow you across entire levels, they take stupid amounts of ammunition to kill one and you can not hide from them, good thing about them is that they can only walk but that will not stop them in their hunt for you. Hm, maybe this should of been called ""Android Invasion.""

Now for the story. What story? You just read it in the store page description, and that's exactly what it is 12 pain staking hours to hear a brief recording and another 3 hours to get off the ship. Yes, Isolation is a mental strain across 15 - 20 hours of nothing but, collecting items to craft and evading enemies, and the reward you get? The worst ending in a video game. Maybe the DLC will be better and shorter, much much shorter."
2164,2,0.4939,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","Alien: Isolation has the virtue of following Aliens: Colonial Marines - so in one sense, expectations are pretty low to begin with, however the preview footage and articles suggest a finer experience which has done much to give fans of the franchise good reasons to have cause for hope.

And in many ways, it is a vastly superior effort.  The attention to art design and sound is second to none.  The Sevastopol - the arena in which the narrative plays out - provides multiple opportunities for the player to discover expositional background which fleshes out the events prior to the player's arrival.

Unfortunately, and yes, I'm afraid this is the rub - the experience is ruined by what is some truly excruciatingly poor game design and some truly dire AI.

The problem is the way in which Creative Assembly has decided the alien isn't just a formidable killing machine - it's also psychic and tracks the player throughout a vast complex with the single-minded dedication of the shark from Jaws 4: The Revenge.

This has the net effect of turning what could be a tense game of cat and mouse into a frustrating, annoying wait for the alien killing machine to go away.  Which it never does.  Ever.

This - on its own - is a gameplay killer, but the developer's insistence on disempowering the player to the point of lunacy completely removes any incentive to progress.

Let's count up the ways in which the alien has the advantage over the player:

  1)  Fast - much faster than the player when they're running.
  2)  Any attempt to run gives the Alien a lock on your location.  See point 1 - ""Fast""
  3)  Invincible - the Alien cannot be killed or injured
  4)  Alien rubber bands inside a 40 foot radius from the player - it never leaves unless scripted to do so.
  5)  Hyper senses mean it can spot you when humans and androids cannot
  6)  Traverses through vents in the ceilings which the player cannot
  7)  Any attempt by the player to use vents results in broadcasting a ping to the Alien which then investigates the vents.
  
  Oh, and the best bit.

  8)  Line of sight killer - if it sees you, you're dead.


  The player's advantages:

  A) Motion tracker with an extremely limited range.
  B) You can hide in floor vents which the alien doesn't appear to have worked out.

  Alien: Isolation is a victim of exceptionally lazy game design.  Creative Assembly were so focused on terrifying the player, that they forgot to give the player the means to survive effectively.  Far too much of the player's progress is dependent upon luck or sheer dogged persistence in the face of highly random events.  The player spends far too much time listening to the motion tracker and has no opportunity whatsoever to engage with the world.  It's a tragic mis-step which completely undermines all the creative effort which has gone into the rest of the game.

  The worst part is that this game has such potential.  It serves as an object lesson in the absolute necessity for someone who understands game design to participate in the process.  

  Gameplay is a cascade of feedback loops.  The primary loops are:

  1)  Moment to moment gameplay.  This is the primary loop which comprises the player action/feedback cycle which powers most of the game.  In Alien: Isolation this is limited to watching/listening to the motion tracker and diving under tables or into lockers.  It absolutely CRIPPLES the gameplay experience.

  2)  Short term strategising - Typically this is scenario-based planning which allows the player to size up a situation and construct a strategy to deal with the scenario.  The reward feedback is a more effective and easier execution of the primary loop in response to their planning.

  Alien: Isolation allows none of this.  No strategising is available because the only game loop is the ""run and hide"" cycle.

  3)  Medium term resource planning - This is where players make medium-term decisions in regard to the allocation of resources.  Typically it's choosing abilities, powers or artifacts which allow the player more options to influence the world.  Strategy involves delaying expenditure to ""save up"" for more powerful abilities or artefacts.

  Alien: Isolation makes a vague attempt at doing this with the ability to construct artefacts but the strategic imperatives for each artefact hark back the run and hide cycle and do little to enable the player's strategic choices.

  Ultimately, this is a wonderfully realised world with incredibly disappointing gameplay which cripples the experience.

  Not recommended."
2165,1,0.567,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Not a very fun game... it might be cool for those people who like dying constantly. But I prefer to not die in a game, especially when there is no way to save your progress regularly, because you have to use save points. When an alien who can instantly kill you over something as small as virtual breathing. I can not stand doing things over and over again, like when you load a save point and have to flip a switch and wait for a bunch of scripted dialogue! That drives me insane. 

The Alien is extremely annoying, hangs around you forever, sniffing around for no apparent reason other than the game knows your area. So you spend tons of time sitting in hiding spots. Which is... really, really annnoying. I'm okay with a little time, but I do not want to spend most of my time sitting in a hiding spot. There is no way to make this alien go away for some time... it's invulnerable. It's extremely stupid. No amount of research can prepare you for the nonstop alien mastery of boring the hell out of you.  

As if the Alien itself wasn't enough, there are other androids and people who really have no rational reason but to just kill you on sight. The androids are of course violent as well. If that's not enough things chasing you around, make sure you don't walk under a vent, because the alien will grab you and it's back to some far away save point. Again, extremely stupid.

There is no safe place, and it's a huge time sink. The game isn't scary it's really freaking annoying. For those of you who like to have fun with a story, don't bother with this game. There is no fun to be had, there is very little time before you are sitting under a table waiting for the idiotic alien to go the hell away so you can get on with the game. Which isn't often enough."
2166,3,0.346,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing",hacking mini games and bashing people with a hammer is fun but trying to get away from an invincible alien that isn't scary at all isn't fun
2167,2,0.4142,"enemy, make, gun, player, system, human, save, kill, weapon, level","The game is great, although the save system is really bad. Rewatching the same cutscenes over and over again is tedious, going over an area and collecting spare parts multiple times, while evading enemies is frustrating, when the save point is 20 minutes away. Trying to find that time windows when you can slip between two androids becomes annoying, when you have to do it over and over again.

At that point, the game isn't even scary anymore. It is predictable and punishes you hard for a little mistake. The save system is so bad, that I cannot recommend this game, until it changes."

Seriously, the graphics are what you would expect from four years ago and it definitely does not handle like a fps at all even thought that's the way you are forced to play it.  I'll edit this later and hopefully the storyline will make up for it.  Just wanted to warn high end gamers that this probably  isn't the game for them."

I crashed during the tutorial, and the loading screens are too damn long for me to want to try again. I think the only purpose for the loading screen is to show you grainy pictures of the Nostromo while also giving you hints on how to play the game that you would have figured out through normal gameplay anyways."

However I pushed forward, and yet the enjoyment I had in the beginning never returned it was a pure nightmare, not in terror but from being completely annoyed at every single step I attempted to take in the game with the game responding with a kind ""Fuck you sir, thanks for your money~!""

This game was promising but clearly, became flappy bird 2.0 in how annoying it is.
Would have given the game a 9/10 but got redused to 5.9, IGN style.

Don't buy this. If you absolutely must, only play it a few hours at a time, otherwise you'll lose your shit to this games annoying alien in the scripted areas.
( Where it literally stays with you through the entire area for over 30mins. )

Here is the first real scripted area in the game, that is completely stupid.
Especially on ""Hard"".

So much for a non-scripted alien huh? ( watch the whole thing to see what I mean. )
Btw, Amanda Ripley does not cast a shadow no matter the settings.
( Anyone going to call this Watch_Dogs 2.0? No? I didn't fucking think so. Funny isn't it? -_- )

2175,3,0.8096,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This game has awful stealth encounters with trigger-happy, auto-aiming NPCs. It seems as though there are quite a few of these throughout the game, probably to help pad out the hours it takes to complete it. There is no freedom in how you handle these stealth encounters or the dull missions.

The characters are bland and lifeless. You don't really feel a connection with anyone.

The sound design and lighting is great. The developers clearly have a love for the source material. Unfortunately, sound design and nice lighting effects do not make the core gameplay any better."

2177,3,0.537,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","In terms of style it looks great. It has that retro feel of how a real spaceship should be: small and uncomfortable, serving it's purpose and nothing more. Graphically in general... Well, it's ok. Human animation kinda sucks (seen way better, say, latest Shadow of Mordor), but maybe aliens are animated better (did not get to them so far).
In terms of atmosphere of a desolated ship it is fine. It reminds me of some better moments from Star Trek: Elite Force 2.
But the story and how it goes... Meh... It seems too slow (even for the original movie), motivation of the characters is quite lax (like why that guy suddenly trusts Ripley, when he just acted like a total psycho? why are people out there trying to kill each other, even considering a riot, when there is an alien hunting them?). And it seems very scripted. Like, when I had to distract a few ""bad"" guys, I was noticed by them when getting out of the vent and they even started shooting at me, but as soon as I was at the other side of the door - a few cries from them and that's it.
Ripley has some sexy legs, but they can't save the game in my mind. 5/10 only for the atmosphere and Ripley's legs. Too bad your 1st task is to dress her =("

This game is effectivly a hide and seek with an alien. this means the second you are spotted YOU WILL DIE. no way around it, sure u might get luckey a couple times but all in all its a waste of money and time. The lack of checkpoints coupled with intense difficulty insta die mechanics and the rarity of save points, this game becomes a grind not a pleasure."

2185,1,0.6364,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","So far I would say a no go on this title. System for combat is fairly clunky and the additional bonus content can be pretty fustrating at times mostly in the ducts as the alien seems to appear everywhere you are no matter what path you take or how long you wait. So far not a fan, guess i should have waited on the reviews from gamestop which rate the game a 59/100. We will see how things progress though.

*will edit the review as time goes on or as things change.

Will also add that after about 5 hours of playing hide and go seek with a AI alien that follows your progress through the entire station it gets kind of repetative. Go from area to area and hide from Androids/Humans/Ever Present Alien repeat. Also if you run for more then a few dozen paces it alerts the alien and it comes and kills you. I have never seen that happen in any of the movies. Toss in the scattered save points you must find and you can lose a hours game time like i just did becuase you have no on the fly saves. 

** Also I get that empying my revolver into the alien was a bad idea but wanted to see if i could atleast scare it off.... Dont suggest that either, does not end well. Just seems like instead of game play they have opted for  a supped up super predator who is bullet proof and omnipresent."
