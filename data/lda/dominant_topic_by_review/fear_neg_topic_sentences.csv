The Graphics are also good for 2005 and the controls aren't bad, nothing special. I really don't know what is happening in the story, you follow one guy and more I don't know. The game feels like a mix between Doom 3, a new guy have to fight against some randomn enemys on his own. The other part of the mix is a generic shooter. This game is nothing special,if I have to discribe it in on sentence I would say: It is like Doom 3, but Enemys have guns and they are smarter."

2,1,0.5455,"run, work, fix, even, issue, try, make, problem, new, fps","This game is frequently hailed as one of the only truly scary FPS games made. A game rich in atmosphere, and setting, that drives you to keep playing it.

I just don't see it. I have tried to get into this game. I want to like it. But I just can't. I can't now, and I couldn't ten years ago when it first came out, the first time I tried to play it. Nothing in the game, nothing in the story, makes me want to keep playing.

That is not to say the game doesn't have its strong points. The AI in this game is top notch, and holds up well even today. The enemies will try to flank you, surround you, they react to being seen, being shot at. They'll throw grenades, they'll fire from cover. They really are some of the best AI I have ever seen. And the game should be played if just for this alone. (Edit: This only applies to the first enemy type you see, the soldiers. When you start getting to the invisible robot ninjas (I am not kidding), the good AI goes right out the window. I witnessed two of them performing a Scooby-Doo routine of running back and forth randomly between the rooms in a hallway, simply because I had my gun pointing down the hallway so they wouldn't come at me. It was hilariously pathetic.)

But there are also problems. There's no on-screen indication when you take a hit. Your life goes down, and that's it. So you could be in a fire fight, shooting from cover, and thinking you're doing well, only to find yourself on the edge of death. Because you didn't know that the enemy was hitting more shots than not. Or didn't realize that someone had gotten to your side, and was free to open up on you. That severely hurts this game. (Edit: There actually IS a visual indicator. But it is on the very edge of the screen, and flashes by so quickly that I literally did not notice it for more than three hours of gameplay.)

They also made a bizarre choice with the weapon and ammo mechanic. In an effort to make you switch weapons often (you can only carry three at a time), when picking up a new weapon it comes with a full magazine loaded, and enough ammo for a second. However, if you already have a weapon of that type, when you pick the new one up for more ammo, you get roughly a third of a magazine. Of course, you can game this system by first tossing your weapon on the ground, picking up the new one (which is now reloaded for you), and then picking up your old one with all the ammo you had before. You'll start to do this very rapidly once you find a weapon you like.

Also, despite being only ten years old, the game does not run well on modern systems. Disabling ""HID-Compliant Device"", and in my case ""HID-Compliant Vendor-Defined Device"" is required to make the game run at anything higher than 6-7 FPS. So don't expect your gaming keyboards and mouse to function when you play this game, and be prepared to reenable those when you have finished.

There are other problems. The game forces ""Letterboxing"" when it does cinematics. Even if you're using a wide-screen monitor and resolution. So expect to see black bars and the top and bottom of an already wide-screen image. And the FMV cut-scenes are letterboxes as well, but set in 4:3 ratio, so they'll be displayed with a box with black bars on all sides.

So what about the story? Well, this was before the ""scary little girl"" trope was completely overplayed. But even so, nothing in this seems to work. There's a few pseudo jump-scares, and some places where the graphics will change on you into another, ""spooky"" scene. But both Max Payne and even Postal 2 of all things had done this years before. (Quick edit: The Postal 2 expansion that featured this was released the same year as F.E.A.R., but five months before.) And to a better effect. In fact, that might be one of the problems I had with this game ten years ago. It so desperately wants to play like Max Payne, but with a horror twist (""Bullet Time"" - the slow motion effect - was featured in Max Payne as well). But this game just didn't seem to push hard enough.

There's a level of interactivity... but it's so painfully limited that you notice more when you CAN'T do something than when you can. You can only do anything with phones if they're already flashing with a voice mail message. You walk by a radio and can't turn it on yourself, but some will spout something directly from the Exposition News Network, letting you know a plot update... and then promptly fall silent again. There are blocked doors, sometimes you can figure out a way to open them, but frequently they can't be. And, again, to put in perspective as to the environment when this game came out, System Shock 2 and Deus Ex had both been out for half a decade before this game was released.

The game shows its age now. But it wasn't fresh and exciting when it came out. F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon (which, BTW, Assault and Recon are kinda mutually exclusive, but they had to fit that name in somehow) was a game that was trying to just exist."

5,2,0.5761,"story, scary, buy, way, series, boring, repetitive, whole, make, first","The story line nearly doesn't exist- it isn't told in any kind of logical fashion, and it makes no sense. The graphics are great, and the ability to slow time is useful at first, but eventually you develop a dependence upon it that becomes a crutch. Enemies do so much damage that you can't risk going into battle without it, but then it makes the game too easy. The weapons are very limited- you either have a machine gun, a rifle, or dual pistols. There are no other legitimate options. The game is scary at first, but after about the third level, the whole shock factor is depleted. I would not recommend this game to anyone- even if you can buy it cheap, you're better off re-playing any of the other FPS's you have in your library. Play ANY one of them."
6,3,0.985,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","To be very honest, I was quite disappointed. I was actually really hoping to like this game, and I did enjoy it a lot in the first couple of hours or so. But after that I realised that there was nothing more to this game but mindless repetitive shooting. Let me explain. First the good bits. F.E.A.R. has some distinct strength, no doubt. It has very nice and realistic use of lighting and shadows, and also a very clever enemy AI, so enemies actually use teamwork and take cover instead of just running at you. The ability to go into bullet time (slow motion) is also very nice, but that ability is pretty much the leverage point of the entire game. You aren't encouraged to use it, you are forced to use it. If you don't, you die too easily. This makes every single gunfight a mindlessly slow drudgery. You are also given cool melee attacks, but you can be sure you won't use them past the first level, because you almost never get a chance to get that close to the enemy. Action in general - as I said, it's fun for the first couple of hours, but then you realise that every single gunfight is virtually the same as the hundred you've had before. The same types of enemies, the same types of arenas, the same types of guns. Nothing changes! This is boring! And speaking of boring... the levels. I have played more than half of the game, which is quite a number of hours, and I've only encountered 3 types of areas  throughout - sewers, warehouses and offices. That's it. It's the same kind of areas repeating themselves all the time. And there are even several parts of the game where you walk corridor after corridor with nothing happening whatsoever. No enemies and no suspense, just corridors. That heavily detracts from the pace of the game. As for the horror element. Well, it sort of works at first, but after first few levels you realise that none of those ""scares"" actually have any effect on you. They are just images. In games like Doom 3 for example, things that jump at you out of nowhere are actual monsters that can KILL you. In F.E.A.R. nothing that jumps at you can affect you in any bad way. It's totally harmless, so why get scared about it? By all means, F.E.A.R. is a well-made game, I have not encountered any bugs and such, but it's not entertaining at all. It doesn't have interesting puzzles, no story to encourage you to play on. It's just a repetitive shoot em up."
7,3,0.7946,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","I picked up F.E.A.R cheap on Steam, as you do, expecting an engaging and enjoyable horror shooter. What I got was something different entirely. After the second level it becomes a drag of just more of the same. Bland, grey rooms, leading into bland, grey rooms. Hey, if you were lucky you might get one with a blood splatter in it, but that was the extent of it. The graphics were nothing special, even running on the highest setting and the gameplay just awful. It eventually became and endless cycle of 'slow-mo on - shoot the crap out of everything - slow-mo off.' Rinse and repeat. A horror experience absent of horror or atmosphere, and this is coming from someone who can barely sit through a horror flick. A thoughtless ending was the climax of a story desperately crying out for some more detail and attention. Save your money, seriously."

Now, you're probably wondering why I'm not recommending this after talking about how much I love it, fair question, because...

I will start from some nit picks and will build up towards my biggest complaints here.

-Weapon models that aren't copy paste of real world weapons are terrible, they feel like slapped together parts of real and fictional weapons and  in general were really ugly.
-I don't know why but in the middle of the game my fram erate would drop to single digits for no god damn reason.
-Whenever I closed the game and re open it my key binds would go back to their default state which was really annoying
-There is a severe lack of environments, for the most part of the game you either fight in warehouses or office buildings,
-The scenery in this game also looks like it is a generation behind even for it's time, the blocky buildings with really bad shading just outside of the window of the building I am in looks really weird.
-Guns have that shaky feeling that it makes it look like my character purposefully shaking it to simulate recoil   which makes automatic weapons really frustrating to use

Now onto my biggest complaint, the story and the characters, the story is told through one of my least favorite method of storytelling, logs. I wouldn't mind them as much if fear had actual characters that I could get some exposition from, but characters in fear are utterly one dimensional tropes that barely have any screen time, whenever I thought I would get some time to get to know the Asian chick and black guy whose name I forgot some shit happens and they have to stay behind. The story is also pretty generic, a standard super soldier experiment gone wrong type of beat with a scare that was super generic even for its time. Overall I can not say I enjoyed this game as much as I would like to and left me with a bad taste in  my mouth, hope the second game will be better."

Although, the game does appear to be a favourite among a lot of people, and I'm sure in 2005 it would have been great, but for me personally I did not enjoy. I'm going to list a few of the issues that I had.

I will start by saying I was going into the game looking for a difficult challenge with some exceptional AI.

I will start with combat as I was really disappointed overall. A part of my issue was with the AI so I will talk about it in a different section as its a bit lengthy. The bullet time was cool but very strong, I decided to not really use it through most of the game until I just wanted to be finished, then I abused it through the last couple of chapters to move quicker as it made the game very easy. The enemies shots felt very disconnected between me taking damage and their visual bullets, but maybe I'm loosing my mind. Some weapons are much quieter than others, which at the start with my volume settings some of them were completely quiet (such as the sub machine gun or the rifle) especially compared to the pistol. Before increasing my volume settings there were times that I only noticed I was being shot from the visual bullets or taking damage. The player movement would slide on ramps (e.g., garage level section) and it was quite annoying.

I have separated out my section on AI as it is an area that a lot of people love, but my thoughts are that its okay. I see their intention with attempting to flank or outmanoeuvre my position or communicate with others, but the level design can be very linear making only one or two ways for them to file though to reach your position allowing you to easily pick them off even without any bullet time, especially if you pick your angles. For most of the game you can just hold an angle and then peek around. For larger sections which allow the AI room to breathe and attempt their manoeuvres if you shoot and then move, when you peek again they will be slightly delayed in their attack, and you can take out one or do some damage and then you repeat until the encounters over, or even just move to outflank them yourself. Maybe its my play style that doesn't mesh with the AI, but I'm very used to games where if you peek too far or if you peek so you see multiple enemies you will die. I think in terms of an AI that I was impressed with I would say Trepang2's AI is better or at least the level design allows for more AI freedom while restricting the players movement. If you are actually looking for a challenge I would recommend Trepang2.

The game overall was quite easy, even on the hardest difficulty. While I couldn't just run and gun everywhere, I could very comfortably hold my position take them out and then move on without much resistance. Enemies could very easily kill you, but it wasn't too difficult to take them out first. Managing health is also easy as you can replenish back to full health after each fight with ease with the numerous medkits around. I decided to only ever use a medkit when I picked up a new one to add some difficulty as you can carry around 10 on your person making fights a breeze if you allow yourself to use them when you get low. I would also recommend doing the same to increase the difficulty even slightly. 

I wasn't really immersed either in the game, which detracted quite a bit from my experience. All the levels just felt like labyrinths which made them not very believable as being an actual location, especially the office levels. A lot of the sections felt more like a unity office asset flip on a basic shooter level.

The game was also a little on the shorter side only taking 6.2hrs to complete looking at my playtime on steam. This included time wondering around the maps looking for voicemails, intractable laptops and the health/reflex boosters which at least for the health boosters I ended up grabbing the majority of as I reached 185hp or 17/22 boosters collected.

Not related to the game but it is quite unfortunate that the game is only available via a bundle as it meant that I needed to spend a little more than I would have liked, and now I own a number of other F.E.A.R games that I am unsure if I will play.

Overall it wasn't bad, its just not what I was looking for."

The gameplay is extremely repetitive and if it wasn't for the slow motion/bullet time effect, it wouldn't have anything original to offer (especially not with its basic, conventional story). And even though F.E.A.R. might try to sell itself as a horror game, keep in mind that it contains very few elements of horror; at least, not enough to satisfy the horror games aficionados. It is mostly about shooting the same enemies wearing different skins. But if you like old FPS games from early 2000, you still might want to give it a try."

The ""horror"" elements, including the girl from the cover, are cliched and repetitive and barely ever actually scary.

Overall, this is a linear shooter with some OK shooting and a nice slow-mo facility. Barks from the opposing forces are useful clues to their response to you, and it's nice that they seem to intelligently use grenades as a 'flush out' technique.

The actual story is a bit weird - welding together a fairly conventional shooter with some horror elements that fall fairly flat.
There's also a strange tonal inconsistency between the horror and a 'comedy fat guy' used as a plot device in several levels. The main pseudo-antagonist presented throughout the game died in a on one of the clumsy semi-cutscenes used to (attempt to) dump exposition - it was such a quick/strange story beat that I couldn't quite believe that it had happened with no apparent warning.

The game did also activate one of my pet hates: towards the end of the game, your arsenal of weapons, carefully curated/hoarded throughout the game is completely and arbitrarily removed. No need for this at all.

Overall, I sort of got the gist of the story, but found it largely muddy and unclear exactly what the details of what were going on were. Standard corridor shooter with bits welded on. It's a resounding 'this is ok-ish'. Will give the others in the series a go as already had them, but wouldn't prioritise this game as a buy."

F.E.A.R. gameplay is about walking slowly, having a button to slow time down & shooting humans with maybe 10 different guns & 3 grenade types. Sometimes you get a flashback where you slowly walk & enemies that die in 1-2 bullets run at you.

If you ever hear people say it was ahead of it's time I'm not sure I agree, since there are games like Half-Life & Deus Ex that released 5 years before. This is a step back from something like Half-Life 1 overall: The level design is more linear & less thought out, and there's a lot less gameplay variance in general. 

I enjoyed the final parts of FEAR: higher enemy variance, higher enemy count, more weapons to use, more scripted action sequences & story being more densely packed. Even the beginning hour wasn't too bad since it was teaching you the mechanics. 
It's really only the middle part that doesn't impress with it's lack of story & fighting the same enemies nonstop for about 3 hours.

To anyone who's gonna buy this game: Look at the steam discussions for a fix on fps dropping. I have a good pc but after like 5 mins of gameplay I was looking at 10 fps until I downloaded & added something to the game files."

There were always loads medkits and armor laying around where there was no need for it, but when I REALLY needed them, no where to be found. 
Some of the guns were god awful, mostly the speargun thing. 
Around the 3 hour mark, you find a new gun on the roof of Armachan, but the new enemies you fight are just carrying every gun BUT the new one you just found, so you get to use it for a total of 5 seconds before it runs out of ammo and shocker, these guns aren't found anytime after that.

The enemy AI is lauded nearly universally, and I can kind of get it. But I felt very whelmed when I actually started playing. I thought they were supposed to be smarter than this. Not to worry though, the last 2 missions completely throw away all of the good combat as well. Instead of interesting arenas with enemies that are at least competent, you just fight rooms full of grenade-spamming soldiers, robots that do way too much damage and take way too much damage to destroy, and hordes of ghosts that sometimes automatically trigger slow-mo and sometimes don't. Unless you're really invested in the story, just stop playing once you complete Interval 9. You've already seen everything that the game has to offer you, and you'll avoid the sour taste that I now have in my mouth because of how atrocious the last couple levels are. 

Developers need to understand that what they absolutely need to land are the beginning and the ending of a game. There can be a disappointing section in the middle, but you cannot just not make the ending of the game until the end of the development cycle. It flopped so hard. 

If those levels didn't exist, solid 8/10 game. With those levels in mind, 4/10.

It is quite possible that in its day it was new and innovative and certainly I've heard good things about its sequel and I'm going to play that next.

The plus points are that there are a number of weapons, the story is interesting with a mix of flashbacks/hallucinations, and it is atmospheric in places.

However, the gameplay becomes very repetitive very quickly with enemies generally doing the same thing (although I believe the AI was innovative in its day) and the lack of weapon choices often means you're trying your best to conserve ammo in a game which isn't really designed for that (particularly as health kits seem to be in almost inexhaustible supply).

I also found that the story was quite difficult to follow with very few clues as to what was actually going on. I know that there are now plenty of forums out there to explain and so on, but for the most part it didn't feel suspenseful as if they were gradually feeding me info, it felt like I largely had no real clue of motivation or what was happening. I largely remained baffled as to who the people were who I was shooting at and why I should hate them.

Story on the other hand, makes no sense!
F.E.A.R. started with a cool idea and turned out to be terribly uninteresting. Things happen to our mysterious hero through “shadows” and “vision” – nothing out of the ordinary, right? But then they made the game an FPS, which means soldiers shoot things, and things got increasingly ridiculous until the game ended up with a plot that didn’t make sense. Oh and let’s not forget the sometimes segued into waking nightmares, where you’re fighting some hooded stranger to the tune of John Carpenter’s Halloween theme.

Enemy AI is impressive, but doesn’t challenge player.
If you played the game, you will be aware of the impressive enemy AI. But my question is this: Why don’t we challenge the player a little more? When you have that many enemies attacking at once, the combat becomes fairly mindless – just hold one button and fire – and that, I’m afraid, can take its toll on some players sanity.

And this level design... I just can't...

FEAR 1 is the best in the series, and while you can buy 2 and 3 individually, for cheap and fair prices, I see that the bundle, which is the only way on STEAM, to buy the game, is 55$. Most would consider 2 and 3 far inferior to the first game, and the first game came out almost 20 years ago. Is this really a 55$ bundle considering 2 of the dlcs are considered bad, the 3rd game is highly mixed and Fear 2 is generally unfavored to FEAR 1, which should be sold at a base price of $9.99 WITH the expansion packs included.

This package should be sold at $30 max, each game is worth about $10 period anymore. The games are quality and hold up okay in most regards but I can't recommend this pack to a newcomer of the franchise, considering the age of the games, lack of updated features, no multiplayer, and competitive pricing.

Now I just have 2 empty useless folders on my system.

Weapon variety is somewhat limited, especially when the game often gives you very little ammo, and thus you end up using the same 2 guns for 80% of the combat. The overall gun play is fine, but not particularly outstanding. There are some destructible environments/covers which is nice. At the same time, every shot landed on the environment will rise a significant amount of smoke, which can last for about 10 seconds. Obviously the AI can see you just fine, so the smoke forces you to hide in the cover and wait, and thats terrible for the pacing of the combat.

155,3,0.7217,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","I'm really torn whether to recommend this game or not. To start off, this game passed me by when it first came out. I'm saying this to fully remove myself from any nostalgia or rose tinted goggles that many people have when reviewing older games from their lives myself included. This game has some really solid gunplay with really good impact and variety among the weapons. To compliment this, it has really nice thought out levels (for the most part) with AI capable of navigating it in a meaningful and challenging way. The game also has some insane lighting capabilities and I personally think it can hold its own against something like Doom 3 with the venerable id tech 4 engine. However, these things are only true for the first part of the game. Often times I found myself alone in empty hallways doing nothing. Occasionally there would be health and bullet time boosters lying around to be found, but otherwise it seemed to have no purpose other than showing off the lighting that clearly monolith were proud of. Going alongside this are the really uninteresting horror segments. While for the time I'm sure it created some nice tension and helped the mystery aspect alongside the story, it comes off as really cheap and contrived. This all culminates in a really boring second half of the game. If you're not walking down a dark hallway or being forced into the Alma ""fire hallway"" segments, you maybe come across 3-5 enemies every 10 minutes. By this point in the game you also have weaponry capable of taking them down in 1-2 well placed shots. The last two intervals before the epilogue being the most boring. It filled with more ""fire hallway"" segments which don't get me wrong, I get they're there to drop the big M. Night tier twist on you but from a gameplay standpoint it's just a slog. After this, you have to back track through the entire vault while Alma spams about a million ghosts at you. Overall, this game is nothing more than a product of its time.

The major downside to the game is the fact that you need to go through hoops to get it to work properly. There is a nasty bug that causes massive fps drops and choppy game play due to an HID issue in mouse drivers. Tried some of the fixes and even mapped a controller to no improvement.

There is pretty much zero level design here. Levels consist of basically boring repetitive narrow corridors with such piss poor lighting you spend half the time turning your flashlight on and off. I understand the devs were going for the horror aesthetic but making the player blind as a bat by not lighting the environments is just annoying.

The combat itself is fun at first, especially with the way the enemies rag doll when you blast through them with a high-impact weapon, but because weapon variety is scarce, it starts to get old fast. The game doesn't change it up until much later unfortunately and there's only so many times you enjoy slow motion bullet-time before it gets monotonous.

It honestly reminded me of the first Max Payne which was basically just a shooting gallery through cardboard-looking environments in the first place. It still could've been a good game in 2021 if they had put some care into the level design. There is one area (the office) which just drags on and on with so much padding (which occurs in all levels). You spend around 50% (or around 4 hours) of the game in that one area with the same drab office interiors not knowing which way to turn because the corridors just keep looping in on themselves because the right corner was hid without lighting. I spent more time being lost in a maze of never-ending looping corners than actually moving through the place. That level alone makes this game a chore.

I wish I could say this game is a classic but it isn't. Even the narrative is non-existent where you just chase this one dude from the start of the game to the end, so there's basically nothing to say there.

All in all, it's boring, even by 2000's standards. I only played this for completion's sake before moving on to the sequel.

The hot graphics trend back in 2004 was pixel-perfect stencil shadowing, and most of the graphics effort in this game is put towards that and moody lighting, which also kills the immersion because it's utterly fake - you can walk up to a pitch-black corridor, even needing your torch to see down it, and immediately once you turn the corner, it's fully lit.

You shoot dudes in the head, move forward, rinse and repeat.

[h1]Okay but is it [i]good[/i]?[/h1]
Depends who's asking. If you were to take Half-Life, keep only the shooting segments, give it a slightly darker vibe and add amateur JPEG jumpscares that will either make you laugh or roll your eyes... would that make for a good game? You be the judge. If that sounds like something you might enjoy, then yeah, sure, go for it.

[h1]Hmm, but do [i]you[/i] like it though?[/h1]
Ye it's ok.

[h1]I don't believe you, Tiwill.[/h1]
Okay fine, you got me. I'll give you the full critique.

[quote=Warner Bros. Entertainment]""Be the hero in your own cinematic epic of [b]action, tension[/b] and [b]terror[/b].""[/quote]

Maybe I should have read that before buying this game, because that's a very contradictory statement right off the bat. 

[b]Action[/b] is the antithesis of [b]tension[/b].
Action is loud, fast-paced, empowering.
Tension requires subtlety and a sense of vulnerability.

This game is about as subtle as a stick of TNT exploding in the middle of a library. 
There's nothing tense about a game designed to make you feel like ""the hero of a cinematic epic of action"".

As for terror, a game [i]can[/i] achieve it through action, but the stakes need to feel high, and the player needs to feel constantly at risk of dying to powerful or relentless predators, which are usually terrifying in their visual and audio design. If the player is fighting for dear life and feeling like prey in a dangerous environment, that is terror through action.

This game is not that. All you do is shoot generic armed soldiers in the head using the exact same weaponry as them. You've got more assault rifles, grenades and medkits than you know what to do with, and you can even slow down time. You have no reason to be afraid. If anything, you're the one they should f.e.a.r.

There is no story hook, either. No characters to get attached to, no sense of urgency. If that long-haired loli was meant to be scary, she wasn't. All she does is interrupt the game with cutscenes. Truly, the most fearsome ability of all.

[h1]Okay okay I get it, it's neither a good horror game nor a good story game. But is it a fun shooter? Is it güd schüt? If I just wanna go kerblam pew pew, is it [b][i]fun[/i][/b]?[/h1]
I mean, there are worse games. But the movement and controls leave a lot to be desired.
If it's trying to be a fun shooter, here's a list of things I don't like about it.
- The ADS button is toggle-only.
- There's no crouch-jumping.
- There's no sprint button.
- There's no reason for this game to have a slow-mo mechanic, when there isn't even a way for you to go fast.
- The FOV gets all distorted like a fishbowl when you look up or down. Never seen that before.
- There's a very strange jitter in the camera if you walk forward and backward, where it doesn't feel like it was made to be played on keyboard & mouse, even though it's an FPS.
- I normally love peek mechanics in first-person PC games (Q and E), but they managed to screw that up too. The character leans way too low, it's like he has to crouch just to peek around a corner. It's just awkward.
- The melee attack moves the camera around like crazy, so when you try to punch furniture for fun, you have to account for the camera movement of the animation, otherwise you'll miss the chair you're trying to whack. Just.. why.
- I once got stuck for like 30 seconds trying to jump out of water. Actually, it happened twice. You know when you're trying to get out of water in a FPS and the game just refuses to let you climb out? Yeah. I had to turn around and repeatedly jump backwards until it worked. Quality.

[h1]Wow, that doesn't sound very good Tiwill. Is there anything you even like about this game?[/h1]
Honestly, I think the way the AI screams out what it's gonna do next is very silly, but it gives you the impression that the AI in this game is very intelligent, which blows people's minds and makes them want to leave a positive review. That's pretty cool.

In all seriousness, this game has pretty good lighting. Yeah, I like the lighting. That's it everyone, review's over, ten outta ten would appreciate shadow technology again.

[h1]Wait! Before you go, can you give an example of an action FPS that [i]did[/i] make you feel terror?[/h1]
Sure. I haven't played a ton of horror action games, but here's a few:
- Dying Light, at night (in the game).
- Some maps in the first Killing Floor can be scary when things go wrong and you and your allies get overwhelmed.
- I guess I can mention Prey, as it did a lot of things right on that front, at least in the first half of the game or so.
- Metroid Prime has its moments."

2021: The light and sound are good. Particles, smoke and bullet holes are also kind of cool considering the age. But anything else is mediocre. 
Now, that famous AI is simply not impressive anymore and even on high difficulty it often acts stupid: performs useless (but ""cool-looking"") jumps from ladders, throws grenades into walls, and gets easily killed by a player who simply sits behind a corner holding Q, E or Ctrl and just shoots mindlessly. 

Pretty much all the ""mind-blowing"" features of the F.E.A.R. AI are present in the modern games, and with the AI being out of the equation, the game has nothing else to offer. Horror episodes are plain boring and not scary, levels are boring and huge, so you will spend a lot of time running along empty halls and storage rooms. The gunplay starts to get tedious after 2-3 hours of playing, because you realize that in general, everything will be the same of the rest of the game: enemies, shooting, guns, maps and the overuse of the bullet-time.

Surely it was a masterpiece in it's heyday, but in 2021, it doesn't have much value beyond nostalgia."
208,3,0.8693,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","[h1]More than just outdated, it's painfully [u]boring[/u] [/h1]
I have some choice words for this game, and if it's the best one in the series, this franchise as a whole is a drawn-out joke that took too long to finish. No wonder Warner Bros. is letting it rot. 

The selling points of this game according to its fans and or marketing come down to three things: 
[olist]
    [*]The mingling of the lighting with the textures
    [*]The horror elements
    [*]The intelligent AI along with the shooting gameplay,notably the most beloved.
[/olist]

Exactly 0 of these points end up being interesting/fun, but rather novelty. It's not enough to call this game obviously aged and from 2005; the game forces you at every opportunity it has to ""experience"" its technology meant to compete on the level of other games at the time. Doom 3, Half-Life 2, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, and other games from the early-mid 2000s tried really hard to be technically impressive. How well this works out varies per game, but for F.E.A.R, it pushes its aspects every other minute which quickly dissipates how exciting they are, as exciting as 2005 technology can be 16 years later. Hard light is everywhere and while in itself feels natural, the level design is too excited to show it whenever possible. Lights produce jagged, completely black shadows too often and look wrong. I am fond that the player's shadow is dynamic and works with the lighting, but the lighting itself always feels plastered to distract from the unimpressive environments. The textures themselves are okay and look good for 2005, but do not make up for the cheap design tricks at every corner. It feels very phony and forced

The story is embarrassing and not engaging one bit. It's not a good kind of campy; it's the kind that makes you roll your eyes to the back of your head. From start to finish, the game is cheesy and tries to take itself half-seriously, making its cliche story even more of a slog to bother with. The plot twist of the Point Man being part of the same overdone ""experiment gone wrong"" trope does not strike the player with any sense of shock or interest, as well as its other tired moments. No revelation keeps me awake, and none of the horror is any good. The ending of the game, a cliffhanger with a jumpscare followed by credits, is blatantly rushed and unsatisfying, making a stance for the game's direction as a whole. Word-of-mouth is that the horror element is a secondary interest at best, but that does not stop it from being relevant in both the game's marketing and set pieces. It's most definitely there, and none of it is scary at all. There is no sense of buildup at any point of the game despite how dark it can get; none of it gets oppressive or makes you feel dread to enter another room. ""Iconic"" antagonist Alma is obviously influenced by The Ring's Samara but holds none of the latter's suspense or visual menace to back up being anything other than a cheap visual gag. The overuse of flames in a dark room or a laboratory hall in nightmare sequences never changes or spices up whatever lack of tension is supposed to occur in them. Finally, the poorest offender of the terrible horror is its forgettable sound. All fantastic horror games make special use of sound design from uneasy ambiance, to dead silent set pieces, to rampant music that pressures the player. Effective sound design does not exist in this game's horror, making it all feel simply shoed-in and exhausting to bother proceeding with. 

Ignorant fans and players in general are quick to dismiss story in games, especially if the gameplay itself is spectacular enough to hold your attention. Giving F.E.A.R the benefit of the doubt, say we can ignore the story or even the horror; all that is left is its reputable lighting tricks, already labeled unimpressive, and the gunplay. Unfortunately, what praise I can give to it is that it is ""serviceable"" at best. The gimmick of the game is its use of on-demand slow motion, available to be activated at your pleasure at any given moment. Initially, it is a fun spectacle. Activating the reflex meter has the world slowly pace so that you can aim your shots carefully, see ragdolls fly or explode, or quickly escape. Amusing at first, but quickly it loses charm. Many of the weapons you use in the game either lack substantial ammunition, become ineffective against later enemies, or are not satisfying to use. Why are the SMGs and most common assault rifles in forced burst fire? It feels jarring in a game that lets you emphasize precision, adding to an unsatisfying experience. Not all weapons are bad: the pistols and particularly the 10mm feel nice and fair in their abilities to make precise shots and eliminate enemies. The shotgun has a reputation, but I find that it only lives up to it on weak enemies such as grunts or ATC. Otherwise, its slow rate of fire and thus slow time to kill betrays its image as an overpowered killing machine. The overall mundane gunplay combined with the gimmicky slow-mo makes shooting become boring and more of a chore needed to proceed. There are other trivial elements such as being able to shoot your grenades mid-air, commit some takedowns, and shoot incoming projectiles, but these abilities are both redundant and ineffective. It's difficult to encourage these minor traits when you have to force them to happen, all the while simply shooting is much more effective and easier. Enemy AI lets you know that the game further attempts to be technologically impressive, and while it mostly works in the game's favor for how it plays out, it is most definitely overly hyped. Enemies flank, throw grenades, take notice of where you are, and cooperate, yet it feels half-baked because the environments themselves are claustrophobically linear and don't give AI room to flourish as much as they deserve. It is too easy to peak corners or bait with a flashlight + followed by trip mine and makes NPCs look like chump change. 

All together: the story is cringy, the horror is terrible, the environments are outrageously dated, and the acclaimed gunplay turns out to be average at best. The formula of the entire game is walk point A to point B, kill a squad of clones, experience an unscary scripted event, and repeat. It is dull and not worth sitting through for more than 2 hours, let alone 10

1. the game showers you with medpacks so much so it made me wonder if I played on easy would I have drowned in them?

3. speaking of the enemy the poor bastards stood no chance with the lean mechanic which made me practically invulnerable to attack in corridors and tighter spaces.

4. open spaces with limited cover is where the enemy shined as they could effectively flank for once until i got a scoped burst weapon and picked em off from afar

5. the enemy notices the light verbally but unless they have line of site act like nothing happened.

6. the combat scenarios are spaced far apart often padded out with ""horror"" which mostly consists of dark spaces and random static here and there with Alma playing peakaboo every now and again.

7. the torch is utter trash so much so that i would have traded it for a candle lit lamp as it would have probably pierced the darkness further than 5 metres.

8. the guns have no iron sight but all have minor zoom so......why?

9.bullet time is good it activates when you choose it to but it basically eliminates any difficulty of enemies.

in summation the only time i died was when i ran around serious sam style with a shotgun avoiding cover and got swamped   by shotgun units. This game is more about atmosphere and in my opinion is basically a dull walking simulator with the occasional shooting range so you dont fall asleep."

I would recommend the Max Payne Trilogy over this game easily as the Max Payne games have more variety and much better looking scenery! It makes up for it's repetitiveness with it's amazing Ai and shooting and gunplay! No firefight and gun battle is the same! You can reload the same checkpoint and do the game firefights over and over and it will be at least slightly different each time!

And even without +1 monitors, the micro-stuttering and graphical freezes during the game will result in massive amounts of needless deaths and frustration.

I think the really high review rating of this game is attributed to a lot of people who played this back when it came out and are thus biased by a nostalgia factor, but 15 years later it's just not that good in my opinion.

F.E.A.R. puts you in the boots of Point Man, a member of the First Encounter Assault Recon team, who is designated to detain Alma Wade and Fettel, paranormal entities that have escaped their maximum security prison and begun to wreak havoc on the city. You have to go in, shoot your way through the hordes of soldiers that they have mind-controlled, and stop them. The game tries to be a horror-FPS, but ends up being an FPS-horror. There's a whole lot of shooting, and very little horror, and the horror that is there is the kind of stuff you'd find in a bad GMod Scary Map. Lots of low-tier jumpscares, moderately spooky atmospheres, and random bodies and blood flying from places they shouldn't be. I think the scariest thing in the whole game was the enemy type I like to call the Cloaker, cause they remind me of Cloakers from Payday 2. They're almost entirely invisible and completely silent, and the only thing they do is parkour everywhere and then run out of the shadows to bitchslap your shit. But while we're on the topic of AI, if there's one good thing to say about F.E.A.R. , it's that for a 2005 game the AI is surprisingly good. They're well-designed, they make call-outs to each other both to their and your advantage, they flush you out of hiding spots, they flank you, etc. Pretty solid. 

A TL;DR and some PROS/CONS-
PROS:
-Solid AI for a mid-2000s game
CONS:
-Repetitive gameplay
-Repetitive enemy types
-Lackluster horror elements
-Frustrating combat at times due to underdeveloped FPS mechanics (no ADS, no sprint, and more)
-Uninteresting story that becomes muddled throughout the game
-Unoptimized for modern computers and screens resulting in stretched resolution and reduced text size (apparently fixable with a community patch)

TL;DR If you don't have the nostalgia factor of already playing it back in the day, just don't bother. There's better horror games out there, there's better FPS's out there, and there's probably better horror-FPS's. 1/10"

F.E.A.R. is a masterpiece in first person combat, which it manages to blend with horror elements exceedingly well. The environments make excellent use of dynamic lighting, and harsh shadowsa, and the enemy AI in the first game is some of the best in any game I've ever played.

Gunfights are hectic affairs. the enemies will try to flank and catch you off guard. The loud, bassy sound of gunfire echoes through the halls. When it's over, all that remains is dead clones and environmental objects scattered about the area in the chaos. The environments never look the same after a gunfight is over. The bullet time mechanic elevates all these other elements, and puts the visual spectacle at the forefront. You'll watch the trails of bullets flying past you, you'll watch enemies fly back or in slow motion after you blast them with a shotgun, you'll watch the shock waves of grenades as they explode enemies to bloody chunks, and send environmental objects flying all over the place. The sections between combat are great too. This game is atmospheric as hell. Nothing in this game is pants-shittingly terrifying, but the horror sections do a great job at keeping tension present between combat scenarios, and holding your interest throughout the game's run time, which is all they really need to do anyway. 

I genuinely cannot praise F.E.A.R. enough, and if you're a fan of First Person Shooters, then this title is a must-play.

All that being said, i can't in good conscience recommend buying this game on Steam. The only way to buy the game on this platform is in a $60 package deal with the rest of the titles in the series. All of which suck donkey dick, if you'll pardon my language. As good as this game is, i can't justify a $60 price tag on a 15 year old game.

Worry not though, you can get F.E.A.R. on GOG with both of it's expansion packs for $10. Go there instead of wasting $60 to get a good game from 2005, packaged with 2 shitty games that you'll never play."

[h1] I used to own a boxed version of F.E.A.R. but was too scared to play this game [/h1]

When it came out, I really wanted to like this game but… I was too afraid to play it. The game came out in 2005 and I was 15 years old then. Now, I really did like horror movies when I was a teenager but playing horror video games, HO BOY, that was a different story. While I could sit as far away from the TV screen as possible, playing a horror game required that I sit close to the screen which made it easier for the monsters in games to come out and kill me – at least that’s how I felt. So when I saw F.E.A.R. on store shelves I had to buy it to face my fears (no pun intended) but… I never went past level 3 because I was so scared of the little girl in the red dress. She reminded me so much of that little girl from “The Ring” movie that I just chickened out and sold my copy to someone on NOT-ebay. Fast forward 15 years later, I figured it was about time I played the game that scared me so much as a kid. Well, I’m happy to say that I finished the game and that I had a jolly good time.

[h1] I don’t think F.E.A.R. is a good horror game [/h1]

F.E.A.R. as its name suggests, is a horror game right? I mean, its name is the emotion creatures get when they are scared, so obviously it’s a horror game right. Well… YES and NO? F.E.A.R. is actually a first person shooter with horror elements. Hmmm… Maybe a Horror game with a heavy emphasis on shooting? No… Look, here’s the deal: F.E.A.R. wants to be a horror game and when it wants to be scary it can be BUT it often forgets that it’s a horror game and just focuses on shooting dudes. 

The majority of my time spent with F.E.A.R. was while shooting cloned super-soldiers and security guards and only ever so often, and for only a couple of minutes at the most, I would get scary scenes that would reveal some plot elements or give me a good jump scare. These scary scenes make up about 20% of this game while the other 80% is shooting dudes.
Does this make F.E.A.R. a lousy game? Heavens NO! F.E.A.R. while light on horror elements, is still an excellent shooter.

[h1] You are the new recruit that can do it all [/h1]

You play as a nameless protagonist who has just joined First Encounter Assault Recon (F.E.A.R.). This group of highly trained marines/super soldiers comes out when regular super solders or SWATS can’t do their job because it involves something supernatural, like ghosts… boo! So one day, you receive a call that a certain telepathic individual is mind controlling an army of super soldier clones and needs to be stopped. Even the game makes fun of this. Anyway, you arrive at the scene and start investigating. Big surprise, it turns out there are other things involved in this than just a crazy telepathic mind controller. As you are investigating the location and killing soldier clones you start seeing weird scary illusions of a delivery room and a little girl in a red dress. While the rest of your team doesn’t last long on the battlefield, you, despite all odds, always seem to be able to survive each encounter. It is your job to see this case until the end, kill the bad guy, figure out what the deal is with the little girl in the red dress and …. Maybe even figure out who you are?

[h1]The shooting is excellent [/h1]

Like I mentioned above, while F.E.A.R. does have some scary moments they are very brief and rarely spring out. Luckily, you have plenty to do while you wait for the scary moments to pop up because there are a lot of bad guys to kill. Each level (chapter) in F.E.A.R. is played with you trying to navigate through a linear first person level while killing everyone along the way. You can hold 3 different weapons. They range from small handguns to deadly disintegration rifles. Shooting feels amazing in this game. It’s the kind of polished first person shooter experience that you only see in games like Half-life https://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/ 
or Halo https://store.steampowered.com/app/1064221/Halo_Combat_Evolved_Anniversary/.
The guns feel amazing, aiming feels responsive and, most importantly, it’s really fun. There is a leaning mechanic which I got so addicted to that I tried to finish every single encounter by leaning from a corner. You also have a few more tricks up your sleeve. Since this is an older FPS, you don’t have recoverable health but instead have to resort to finding first aid kits and bullet-proof armor. You can hold up to 10 health kits in your inventory and use them when in trouble but you can’t hold armor. You also have reflex mode, which is the slow motion in this game. Depending on how you play the game, this can either be extremely useful or something you often forget you have. During the first few hours, I barely used it but by the end of the game, I found myself using it quite often. 

[h1] A warehouse, a corporate office an abandoned building complex… Scary enough for you? [/h1]

The entire game takes place in the above mentioned locations. While you aren’t shooting dudes, you will be navigating the level until the next gunfight or scary moment. Often, your road will take you through a dark hallway and that’s where you pop out your flashlight. Don’t just rush to the next fight though. Explore a little bit. You might just find some permanent health and reflex boosts as well as some extra health kits and weapons.

[h1] Smart enemies but not too smart [/h1]

People often praise the enemy AI in this game about how smart they are. While I have to agree that the enemies are smarter than the average FPS AI, some of their behavior is… questionable. For example, they won’t just stand and shoot, they will run, hide, flank you, surprise you and call their allies for help, however, they will also happily charge at you, one by one, while you mercilessly mow them down from the same hiding place. I guess this really can’t be helped since many of the levels have tight corridors and there aren’t that many ways the enemies can engage you. Overall, I certainly agree that the enemy AI will keep you busy, no matter which difficulty you choose, but I just wish they wouldn’t charge so often into my shotgun. 

[h1] Don’t buy this game ON STEAM [/h1]

At this point, I think I’ve made it clear that I’ve had a great time with this game. I would whole heartedly recommend you go and buy it right now BUT, I can’t, at least not here on Steam. See, Warner Brothers know that this game is great and popular and that people want it. However, they also have Fear 2 and Fear 3 which, I guess, aren’t as popular as this first game. So, because they are greedy, slimy, consumer-unfriendly, publishers, they made it possible to only get this game (and the two expansions) if you buy the entire F.E.A.R. franchise for 60 $. 

60 $ for all F.E.A.R. games is actually an OK price BUT, here’s the thing, you are able to buy F.E.A.R. 2 and 3 separately but not this game. So, they are hoping that you will fork out 60 dollars just so you can play this game that’s 15 years old as of writing this. If you want to buy the entire package, go right ahead but, if you just want to play this game, here’s what you should do:

[h2] Go to GOG, and buy F.E.A.R. Platinum instead of this bundle [/h2] 

And since it’s a GOG version, share it with a friend because GOG is awesome.  Not saying that other F.E.A.R. games are bad but if you just want to play this original one, GOG is your best answer. F.E.A.R. is a fantastic first person shooter with some nice horror elements. I absolutely recommend you buy this game ... just not on Steam.

257,3,0.5275,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","the way the editor forces you to buy everything including the trashy sequels is awful, hence the ""no"". go find it on another game platform instead. otherwise it sure isn't a waste of time for a shooter fan.

models, textures,animations look a bit aged, environments aren't very varied but the work on sfx (lightning, particles, slowmotion) and atmosphere completely offset it imo. the way you destroy the places during combat is top-notch and the oppressing, paranormal covered op setting is sort of thrilling. musics and sound effects are also pretty competent.

the plot is a mystery unraveled through the campaign and thanks to messages you're free to skip so it doesn't intrude on your playtime too much. beyond that, the story is serviceable but not transcending and the characters while funny at times aren't very developed, especially since you often operate on your own.

horror is a mixed bag: most is script-based and a lot is ""in your face"" trying to take you off-guard. doesn't mean it won't work but there has been more subtle around.

combat is where the game shines like nothing else: weapon coupled with the sfx are punchy to a ludicrous point, the level-design is engaging and superbly puts in action a simple but reactive ai showing more complex than average behaviors, putting modern shooters bad guys to shame. it's however very hitscan-centered; you're very reliant on either slowmo, cover or consuming lot of health packs in your inventory to stay alive, none of which being that skill-indexed. that's more of an in-depth limit for people with very high standards, so if you just want a fun shooter you don't have much if anything to worry about.

in short, the overall package is pleasant and the gunplay is among the best for singleplayer fps. only issue is the way it's sold on steam.
in case you're also interested, there also are two expansions packs:
-Extraction Point is known to have some of the best arenas in the series and a few nice additions. that's a great ramp-up in action and horror but at the cost of a story all over the place.
-Perseus Mandate is on the other hand a step down pretty much everywhere. the new models and the art direction are sloppy at times compared to even the original, plot isn't a good selling point once again, horror falls flat more often, the fights have a few good ideas but the new faction is cringe-inducing and the level design is uninspired especially by the end. its campaign pales compared to the two previous games, and although it has a few, very cool bonus missions, you won't miss much if by any chance you don't buy it."

Take this review with a grain of salt... you might feel completely different about this game. This review is a chaotic one but here we go:

The game has a story to tell, but it boils down to spooky encounters that usually aren't that scary. ( especially if you wield a minigun or a rocket launcher! ) Levels can change on some really stupid points and everything feels poorly connected. It is early on explained why soldiers you fight look all the same, they are replicas. What this means is that you will be fighting same type of bad guys during the whole game and that becomes tiring. Later on, swarms of ghosts attack you and that is 0 fun.

Environments look awfully bland, same offices and street walls repeated on and on... add those 2005 pitch black shadows to the mix and you get quite a forgettable set of scenes. Dynamic lighting is a nice touch, some effects like water reacting to movement look quite good but that's about it. Gunplay is the selling point of the game, really. VK12 is a beast of a combat shotgun and it's fun to use - it's without a doubt one of the best shotguns in history of FPSs. I also had some cool moments with the pistol and the Penetrator gun. Unfortunately, combat quickly gets repetitive. That combination of explosive action and slo-mo isn't quite common but i honestly feel the game is overrated. Maybe i'm asking too much for a game that's 15 years old. I dunno.

I admire animations of F.E.A.R. like the ones that happen when you lift yourself up or slide down the rope. I don't know if there was a game to feature such stuff before this one. But now, almost every AAA game has them. On the other hand, normal animations of firing and reloading are done in GTA San Andreas style, all wonky and imprecise, which is not good for an FPS game! Weapon sounds also suck. For some reason both smg and assault rifle are burst on 1 click and auto on hold...

Sometimes i get those nostalgia goggles for the games i played a long time ago. This review is my honest opinion and a reminder that it isn't quite worth replaying (at least not the whole game) in the future. If you want to try it out visit isthereanydeal dot com and wait for a deal, 55$ dollars for the pack is nuts. Looks like someone is exploiting those goggles! ;)"

The fights basically consist of shooting people in the head in slowmo. I put it on the hardest difficulty and it still wasn't that hard. Sometimes you run out of slowmo and you retreat until your meter fills up again. You just stand there for 30 seconds staring at a wall waiting for a bar to fill up. Wtf? 

The main character is a silent protagonist, so not too much you can do with that story wise. There is some stuff about some ghost girl causing problems somehow. The logs relating to it are scattered all over and not well organized. Often I would find one and then someone would start talking over the log or a gunfight would break out and I wouldn't even hear it. There is no way to replay it if this happens. What little plot there is just got flushed right down the drain.

There are a lot of moments when spooky stuff happens but it felt pretty canned most of the time. You see something move out of the corner of you eye, but when you look its gone. Or some boxes move on their own or something. I only had a jump scare like twice the whole game. Annoyingly most ghosts are completely harmless, but then some will kill you instantly. Often the game dumps you into a vision or something that's not real and its hard to know if you should be wasting your bullets or not.

I dunno. Maybe if you really liked the bullet time sequences from The Matrix. I didn't really enjoy it all that much."

In my particular case, I had never played FEAR, but I had known of it ever since it was released. Suffice to say that it had always caught my eye. I've finally taken the time to play it along with its 2 DLC in the span of 4 days.

The positive is the AI of the game truly holds up to today's standards and I believe even better than some AAA companies. They should be taking note.

Unfortunately, I wouldn't say FEAR holds to today's standards and technology (obviously). It would be unfair for me to criticize it that way but it should be mentioned so that people who would like to play FEAR are fairly warned. In those regards, those who are using Windows 7 and beyond...this game is not properly optimized and will never be because it has been abandoned. This is the final product and the game causes a lot of errors with these operating systems. GAME BREAKING errors. I had to dig so deep in the web to be able to find solutions to these problems, and one I couldn't solve so I needed to jump to the next level through console commands. 

I can see why it was so big in its time. Pacing is not that good and the scares are meh for today's standards.. The few couple of times I got scared was because of an enemy appearing behind me without me realizing it. It had great concepts and great wtf segments to cause the player to be scared that I feel The Evil Within might've gotten some inspiration from here.

Play for the nostalgia. Windows 7 and beyond will have many errors. Be tech savvy and prepared for frustrations."

The story is the usual thing about secret experiments gone wrong, and the test subject is on a psychic rampage. The spoopy element is so generic and hammy that, a bit like Dead Space, it's more there for fun than to actually spoop you. It has no bearing on the gameplay until the last 10 minutes, where you have to fight ghosts that move linearly towards you like a Unity tutorial game. The music is as generic as the rest of the game, consisting mostly of waterphones and dark ambient sounds.

The fighting is most fun when you're against human enemies who move quickly from place to place, sometimes rushing you and sometimes holding back and forcing you to make the first move. The slowmo mechanic sort of ruins this though, as it makes it really easy to pop out of cover and pick off everyone in your line of sight before they can react. All the other combat encounters are some kind of slow, chunky damage sponge that doesn't use cover, or a melee enemy that just runs towards you.

The weapon variety isn't great either - you have 3 or 4 weapons with usable amounts of ammunition for 90% of the game. When you do get a heavy weapon, you feel compelled save it just to dump all the ammunition into the next damage sponge enemy.

The lighting and visual effects are great for 2005, and they really make use of it to create a moody and foreboding atmosphere. Unfortunately the rest of the game is just too monotonous for me to recommend it.

I want to give special mention to Norton Mapes, who's a recurring character in the game. His entire character is just that he's a fat dumb nerd who sexually harasses his coworkers and leaves wotsit packets everywhere (also he has a giant belt buckle that says RTFM). It's such a bad attempt at comic relief that it makes you wish he was just another joyless NPC."

+ A soundscape that strongly enhances the experience.

+ Superb level design which doesn't get you lost but doesn't hold your hand either while managing vast labyrinth-like spaces.

[h1]And so we come to the bad...[/h1]
- The graphics haven't aged well. It was on the low end already in 2005 when it came out compared to other games of that year and it looks the more robust and simple today.
- It followed the footsteps of it's predecessors that had this logical flaw of collectables like heavy weapons and ammo lying around in places where they should not be, like in an office building. Or security gun turrets that descend from an office ceiling.
- The story and lore was executed through written material and recordings that forced you to sit tight while it was delivered. It was harmful towards the pace of the game, felt uninspiring to follow and actually I couldn't care less about it.

Maybe the rights holders make more money on the later titles than the earlier ones; I seriously have no idea why this is happening.

[If you are in the future reading this, let me elaborate: As I am writing this, it is the latter part of the year 2019, and the price for this game is 54 dollars, because you can only buy it a pack which has every F.E.A.R title.  Like I said, I have no idea when this happened or why, but it is total B.S.]

F.E.A.R (the first one) is one of the greatest FPS games to ever be released, and it's worth picking up ENTIRELY ON ITS OWN.  There are two expansions, but the one that you want is Extraction Point.  Other people have talked about why it's great, so I won't repeat what has been said.  Mandalore Gaming put a good video on it on YouTube, and Civvie11 will probably get around to making one as well (check if you are a time traveler from the future).

If you are curious about older shooters and want to see what the hype was about (or are going through Monolith's catalogue, which is *absolutely* worth it) get it for the five or ten (which is still damn expensive, DOOM 2016 is like 20 dollars these days) dollars it is worth.

Ok, look. I get that it might have been a fine game when it came out back in 2005, but it just doesn't hold up (at least to my standards). I mean if you want to go through 6 hours of empty tight hallways and dumb a.i., all covered by a not at all interesting plot, be my guest! 
Everything looks ugly. And i don't mean that things look like polygons, the whole game is a variation of grey, black and red. The weapons are ugly, the character models are ugly the scenario specially is ugly. It doesn't help the fact that levels in this game are always rundown buildings, sewage treatment plants or underground facilities (the only level that is pleasing to the eye is the office building and even that one is ugly by the end of it).
 As i played the game i started to wonder what was going through the developers minds when they were designing the levels. Did they really think that making the player go through dark lit hallways, parking lots, ventilation pipes, underwater tunnels,and yellow stairs over and over again would keep him engaged? Oh but don't worry, they did not forget to place, every now and again, a phone or notebook that triggers a little piece of audio that may or may not contribute to the story. I mean, they needed to break the pace a little, or the players might have a heart attack from the thrilling experience of killing the same bot for the 10000 time.
Speaking of combat in this game, it's boring. You will always be fighting the same enemies with some slight variations here and there. It will either be a few enemies in a corridor or a slitghly larger amount in a big room!
The story is ok. It's not bad, but by the time i had found all the answers i didn't really care. Also, it has the same issue that i have with other games, which is that whenever the story is progressing and the character has to get to point A or B there will usually be some dumb setback like the power is down or the door is locked which serve simply to pad the runtime and that does not contribute to the story at all.
The game isn't scary. 
To sum it all up, when i decided to buy this game i was wanting to try something new, and saw a lot of people talking really well about it, so i bought it along with it's expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate. In the first half of the game i tought it was ok, until i realized that that was it. It didn't built any suspense, it didn't got harder, it didn't got scary and it didn't change. By the second half i just wanted it to end. It felt more like a chore than anything. And now that i have finished the main game, i have no interest in playing the expansions and i certainly have no interest in trying the sequels.

Credit to the ones that coded the enemy logic but curse them in the same breath for giving the enemies that most deplorable of qualities - a will to live.  After getting tired of the grind I wanted to breeze through the rest to see if it perked up, however the enemies refused to obligingly line up in front of my gun but instead forced me to ferret them out.

Amongst that I also got the impression that the game really wanted to showcase its dust effects because one stray bullet in a wall put out a smoke-bomb's worth of opaque dust.  Far too much time was spent waiting for that to slowly clear before getting to continue the grind."

I wish there was a sideways thumb, the game definitely deserves a recommend but Warner Bros honestly deserves the shaft. I'm seriously debating which thumb I should use here.

A platoon of clone soldiers and their psychic commander has gone rogue. It is up to you, the Point Man of no name and incredible reflexes, to stop them. The combat is the real meat of the game and Monolith nailed it, guns feel powerful and the encounters are often short, vicious and chaotic. Both sides can really do some terrifying damage and the Replicas will punish your mistakes, so you really need to use that famous slow-mo ability to outperform your enemy. You can even shoot the grenades as they leave the hands of you enemies, pulping the poor guy and the couple standing next to him in the process before kung-fu kicking your way through an adjacent window and tearing the wannabe flankers up with SMG fire before they can react, it's greatly entertaining stuff.

There's also the aforementioned spooky bits, often involving a little girl of standard horror movie fare, varying kinds of gory visions and even explosions and hellfire. It paces out the encounters nicely, keeping up the tension between the action and sometimes even faking you out, making you expect imminent spooks but leading you into a breather spot instead.

It even looks pretty sharp, the particle and lighting work are some top shelf material and give the game some real atmosphere. As for complaints, it does drag some areas on for too long, a couple of the encounters are a bit too trial-and-error for my taste (the part with the shutters and the mech drop in the condos mainly come to mind) and the piecemeal storytelling is frankly too bland to really keep up interest alongside the high-octane action and spooks, but it's not enough to really detract from the experience too much.


""If it's so good, then why not buy it? Surely there's some hidden gotcha involved?""

There sure is. This game used to be available for 10-ish bucks including the expansions, which made it a good deal even off sale, and when the sales dropped that >50% off it was just an absolute steal! However, Warner Bros decided to shaft the players for whatever reason (I suspect poor sales on the sequels) and removed the original bundle, nowadays you can only buy it bundled with the sequels (largely considered to be the markedly inferior games) for the price of an AAA title. You can still buy the sequels separately, just not the first game.

Supposedly there are retailers still selling F.E.A.R Platinum for the same price as always, but that's frankly outside the scope of Steam reviews and you should be able to do the research if you're interested. And you should be, it's a fantastic game."

As expected it's a very old game, with that typical linear story and basic mechanics.
It focus on the Reflex mode and choosing the right weapons, that's about all the mechanics you got, and you get plenty of medkits everywhere, so avoiding death is very easy.
The story ain't bad for the time it was made, since it introduces the concept and background story of the sequels made after, in matter fact i think it's the main reason to play this game.

The gameplay repeats itself a lot mid way into the game, either is combat or just walking to the next section.
It isn't very compatible with newer systems, for example the resolution 1920x1080 display very small subtitles, yet it didn't bother me anyways.

Basically, if you don't mind outdated graphics and gameplay, and you're either in for the franchise, story or just nostalgic reasons like myself, I would say go ahead and get it.

If you are new to this series, then i would advice to play this one just for the sake of the story, else if you don't really care about the story then I would advice to move on to more recent games of F.E.A.R. since this one is clearly outdated in almost every aspect.

328,3,0.4735,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","The problem with games like FEAR, CS and COD are that they quickly devolve into corner/edge camping head shot mode, which is boring.

This is because of the limitations of the weapons arsenal. You only have weapons that shoot bullets in a straight line, so if someone decides to just sit at a point and camp a door or corner, they will always have a massive advantage. You basically only have to know at which height someone's head will show up when they come around a corner and shoot there. The only option an attacker has is to use grenades, which is lame.

Quake, Tribes and Unreal had already fixed this problem with better maneuvering, longer TTK, armor which protects against instant kill headshots, a much greater diversity of weapons and items like the shield gun and teleport gun. If someone is constantly hiding and camping one corner, you can get rid of him by using flak (which ricochets off walls and then still does damage, like the shotgun in T:V), shooting rockets or grenades at the area around his position (and you don't have just 3 grenades, you have a grenade gun with dozens of grenades), using shock rifle combo's or doing something like a shield gun jump to get behind him. This makes much more interesting engagements that aren't just about aiming at someone's head from a static position. As a result these games are much faster and more dynamic and essentially more game-like, and at some point it seems like people stopped wanting gamelike games, they started wanting movielike games with lots of interludes, realistic graphics and themes like World War X or cops. 

It seems very immature to me, and a crutch for video game makers to keep targeting  the same crowd of players because it's success guaranteed (except it won't last). The video game bizniz is only about 50 years old and PC FPS games at best 30, the surface has barely been scratched, many more things are possible but if you just keep making COD's and BF's then you'll never get there."

The levels are unmemorable, repetitive and linear and the scare-combat-scare format becomes predictable.

Pros: 
- The A.I. puts even most modern games to shame. This makes the shootouts very engaging and tactical.
- The destruction physics, while dated, still create an impressive spectacle of dust, sparks and particles when shootouts escalate. 
- The gore effects are very punchy and satisfying, making the weapons feel powerful.
- The slo-mo power, despite nowadays having been done to death, is a satisfying and fun tool to use, and fits well with the tacticality of combat

Cons:
- Flat, bland, boxy, uninspired, dull and uninteresting environments all the way through. It says something that a parking garage is a breath of fresh air in terms of places to fight things in. 
- Inredibly repetitive gameplay: shootout, find thing to get past thing, creepy ambience, shootout, find thing to get past thing etc. The only break from this routine is an occasional sliver of exploration to find health and slo-mo upgrades.
- Lack of variety: there's only a few weapons in addition to three grenade types (one of which is next to useless), two of which you'll find ammo for so rarely they hardly matter anyway. The enemies stay essentially the same all the time with a couple of tougher minibosses you'll encounter from time to time.
- Dated mechanics: for example, despite this being a tactical shooter, aim is toggle-only. Since it's only a minor zoom-in and not an iron sights view, it can often be hard to discern whether you're zoomed in or not, which is a problem since being zoomed in affects your movement speed. No sprint function makes the movement feel sluggish in comparison to more modern shooters. Guns fire in bursts even if you only click the mouse button, and weapon recoil is very erratic. 
- The horror aspect is dated, and the horror and combat sections are completely separate from one another. It's also predictable (being often identified ahead of time with a signal of unknown origin), and relies in many places on cheap jump scares.
- The story is unengaging and relies mostly on voiceover instead of being woven into gameplay.
- The campaign is criminally short, clocking at under 7 hours on normal difficulty.

The fact that you can no longer buy this game separate on Steam makes this unreasonable to purchase at its current price (55$ as of writing). But you CAN get it on GOG.com separate from 2 & 3 -- I'd recommend getting it from there instead, but I had it a looong time before this stupidity showed up. This is someone (probably WB Interactive, but who really knows) being a jerk.

Ignoring the price, F.E.A.R. is an excellent FPS that any fan of the genre should get. The ""spooky"" elements are all jumpscares, and relatively simple ones at that, but the gameplay and the little tidbits of story you get as you progress more than make up for its tameness. The AI is excellent, and even today the graphics are solid -- maybe not beautiful, but they certainly look good for a nearly-13-year-old game.

The expansions are worth getting as well (most sites nowadays include them with the base game); while [i]Perseus Mandate[/i] is a separate ""ending"" from the rest and suffers for it (but retains the excellent gameplay), [i]Extraction Point[/i] is necessary for the full experience, I'd say."

Every horror element added to the game involves a jump scare and that's about it. Someone will appear before you and there will be a loud noise to ensure that you know you're supposed to be scared at that moment.

The storyline has about the same depth as the scares. It's fairly generic (even for the time that this was released) and by the end I just wished it would skip the story to get me through the game faster.

Now let's look at the FPS portion of the game. I will admit that by the end I had hoped that they would just give me more people to kill instead of the super scary scenes but that is not because the gunplay is fun. It's just less tiring than the scares.

There's nothing enjoyable about firing the guns in this game. They're fairly basic and sadly interchangeable. There was no gun I would hate to drop in favor of another. It just boiled down to bullet count. 

It's difficult to make a game shotgun not be fun to use, but by the gods, they managed it.

The hyped up A.I. I am finding it difficult to comment on. I played it for the first playthrough on the second to highest difficulty so this could completely change in the highest difficulty. Most every fight started out with me taking one of the enemies out and then the rest hiding around a corner before I did the same to them. The regular A.I. didn't seem terribly intelligent to me. Maybe mine were defective.

The game fell flat as a FPS.

TL;DR Jumpscares and boring gunfights do not make for a solid horror fps."

The levels are so long, uninteresting, and repetitive that it was hard to maintain a desire to finish. The graphics are so-so for a mid-2000s game, the shooter mechanics are about as clunky as most shooters from a decade prior, and the ""horror"" elements are laid on so thickly and inelegantly as to be self-defeating.

-The enemies have aimbot, literally. The weakest enemy in the game will shred you in seconds.

-Enemies have WAY too much HP, feels like every enemy is a semi-boss.
-Turret sections are dumb, they don't have a puzzle or meaning, they're just you getting pounded hard.
-Lack of ammo for any weapon that isn't the SMG or the Assault Rifle later on.
-The optimization is garbage so the game will stutter on a Quad-SLI Titan Xp rig.
-The subtitles don't scale with the resolution so they are super small.
-The story is pretty broken.
-The level design is horrible, everything feels like a non-sensical maze and you have to walk around trying to find a small switch or air duct.
-There's a dumb black fog so sometimes for no reason you can't see 4 meters in front of you even with the flashlight.
-Enemies' arms are like jello, they bend and glitch in weird ways when shooting you while moving or dying.

While at first, the horror aspect is done pretty well, as the slow pace and atmosphere create a very horrific setting, eventually, the horror devolves into annoying shooting sequences where you basically can't move and just have to cover yourself from things flying at you in an open circle. The guns are awkward as all hell. Most of them are burst fire, which means if you hold the fire button, when you release it, you're typically going to waste a few bullets. Not that that should matter too much, considering how much ammo there is lying around for most guns. Most guns also don't feel like they do a whole lot of damage. A lot of people praise the AI in Fear, as they should. Not many shooter games have enemy squads that actually feel like...squads. They work together. They get mad at each other sometimes. They flank you, cover each other, spot light coming from your flashlight, and throw grenades, all of which would be good things, except grenades in single player shooters suck, especially when you run as slow as you do in this game, and being flanked is tough to deal with, because again, the movement speed is incredibly slow. As far as graphics go, it looks like if you decided to run a Source game in 4k. The story is confusing as all hell and ends awfully.

382,3,0.8182,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","I originally played and completed F.E.A.R. shortly after the disc version originally launched years back.

I felt that F.E.A.R. was a combination of a cliche, creepy Japanese-style telekinetic murder girl, uninteresting characters, first person shooter gameplay with bullet time and melee combat since those were big at the time, a story where nothing happens except at the beginning and near the very end, and last but not least: possibly the most boring locations I've ever been to in a video game.

When I was younger, playing GoldenEye on my N64 for the tenth or so time, I remembered thinking to myself: ""Wow, part of what makes this game fun is just how many locations I get to go to! On top of a Russian dam for a few minutes, then inside it with secret evil plans, an arctic tundra, a missile base, a cruise ship, a jungle, an underground lair, a cave system, a communication cradle thingy, oh and the streets of Russia in a tank, the interior of a train, a Russian cemetery at night, a Russian police group thing's headquarters, and probably others I'm forgetting!

Wanna know where you go in F.E.A.R.? I would estimate that less than 25% - but I'll be liberal here and say 25% to the game's betterment) is warehouse and industrial properties in cities. 75% or so of the game takes place in an office building. Prepare to be walking around through office floors, hallways, meeting rooms, cafeterias, etc., for hours. There are a few robot enemies, and some invisible guys will attack you, and an occasional big guy who is tough to kill will show up, but the majority of the enemies are generic humn cloned soldiers. If not for the creepy Japanese horror girl, this game would be one of the most bland games in existence, because the locations did not interest me at all, and that is coming from an introvert who tends to love indoor areas in games, and enjoys offices even in real life.

Not only did I find the locations and enemies to be lackluster, but the story tried hard to be less interesting than the setting. Most of the game, nothing happens...your objective is ""Kill Paxton Fettel"" for almost the entire game, and they have the audacity to post that as your objective repeatedly in game. Imagine if you played a Batman game and they nagged you to ""catch the Joker!"" on every loading screen or every time you looked in the menu, for virtually the entire length of the game. You will be chasing Paxton Fettel for probably 90% of the game, and nothing really happens plot-wise of much relevance until you do get to him. To me, this game was bankrupt of plot, not bothering with it except to open and close the story on the game.

Considering the title acronym spells a word to invoke horror, the horror angle is obviously an important selling factor. The game has a few jump scares here and there, if that is your thing. As a shooter, F.E.A.R. is competent, but there are so many other shooters I had actual fun with. As a horror game, I jumped probably 3 to 5 times, as I recall. Nothing really terrified me or made me feel uncomfortable. If you want actual horror, I found Prey 2017 and Alien Isolation to both be games that unnerved me based on quality scares instead of spawning in a creepy Japanese murder girl with loud sounds because F.E.A.R. doesn't know how to do horror with tact, at least in my opinion.

There's not much left to say about F.E.A.R. It's basically devoid of anything I liked. The bullet time and melee were okay enough, but so many other games offer gameplay that is as good - if not better- and the other aspects of those other games such as interesting/likable characters, relevant events all throughout the game, objectives that change throughout the game, neat locations, etc. all entertained me far more than what F.E.A.R. had to offer. I cannot recommend F.E.A.R. as it is one of the most bland big-release gaming experiences I've ever had in my life."

384,3,0.8965,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","As a late-comer to the game, it's hard for me to write a review that captures how I really feel about the game. It's an old game - it just is... But is this a bad thing? Well, for its time, it was quite revolutionary in its AI development, partical physics, subtle scare tactics complimenting in your face horror, and lighting effects. Playing in 2017, the graphical aspects weren't anything spectacular, but I didn't expect them to be - we've come a ridiculously long way since then lol The AI is something that people gush over allllll the time when they talk about the game, and I have to agree with them for the most part. Hearing the enemy communicate and act on commands and prompts was interesting and could definitely put you in a spot of trouble or help you catch a massive case of death. The sparse enemy variation means that you'll be able to figure out fairly quickly how enemies operate and be able to deal with them, but that doesn't mean they'll act the exact same way every fight. The gunplay isn't bad - double pistols is still double pistols (looks badass but isn't accurate in the slightest), shotguns blow up enemies at close range, and long range combat is appropriately difficult. All this being said, I wanted to like this game. I REEEEEALLY wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. Mostly because of the horror aspect. The game just isn't scary. Like in the slightest - not by today's standards, anyway. There's just too many ridiculously scary games out there - many of them probably taking notes from this game but with better hardware to power there spooky visions. The story of Alma and her quest for revenge is still and will always be bloody and tragic, but it's just not enough for a recommendation from me. If you're looking for a classic FPS that was an excellent stepping stone for its time, you've found it. If not and you're like me looking for a scary military FPS, then you'll probably feel about like I do."

Fyi, some spoilers (ish, you're really not missing anything)

The story gets worse as the series progressed. Having two timelines because WB sold the rights to vivendi first then monolith produces two different ""cannons"" meaning that what happens in the first game means little anyway. The combat is fun at first but after about an hour it becomes grating to say the least. Given that the only other element is ""story"" the game really just ends up being in a crisis as to what it wants to be.

F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon (this one) is the best of all the games, and you will get some enjoyment out of it, but no matter which expansion/sequel you play after the series just gets dull. You can pick from vivendi's ""Everything you did in this game didn't matter and everyone dies"" which comes in the form of two mediocre ""expansions"". You could also pick  monoliths timeline which starts a bit more promisingly with F.E.A.R. 2,  but then shoots it's own foot off when it kills the protagonist we spent the whole game getting attached to in F.E.A.R. 3. which is a sorry excuse for a game if ever I saw one.

Enviroments are boring to say the least. Once you get past the whole ""decayed urban centre"" you get ""slightly futuristic office"" and then back to a mix of the two. Guns are fairly bland, you get various types of machine gun ranging from pop-gun pew, heavy pew, lots of pew and long range pew. They have names apparently but somehow it really didn't seem important. One thing I did like is that, your starting weapon, the pistol is one of the best weapons throughout the whole game.

Characters are really poorly done, there's very little fleshing out, your own character you only really get any developments much later/at the end of the game. The there's a team mate who goes missing who no one really gives a toss about, some scientists who die, a scientist daughter who dies, evil cannibal guy who dies (and thanks to both cannons annoyingly comes back anyway) , kick-ass black guy who dies in one of the cannons and a hot asian who also dies in one of the cannons. My favourite was the nice asian lady because she hits on you at one point. Overall it doesn't really leave much room for attachments or immersion though. 

The cover mechanics are interesting in the way of you poke your head out you get shot, but that's alright because armour is literally everywhere as well as the same generic medic box, ammunition isn't too much of a problem - rough conservation means you can use your favourite gun 70% of the time, and the slow motion feature is to be honest, boringly repetitive. 

The enemy varies from several types ""grunt"" ""stronger grunt"" ""tough cyborg"" ""mech robot"" ""flying mech robot"" and some nasty ghost fellows. For it's time? Great! Nowadays? piss poor and boring. Not to mention the fact they conveniently shout literally everything they're doing before they do it handly giving you the perfect 3 seconds to jump out and rain bullets on their day. 

This all being said, it's a good game. I remember watching my dad when I was younger playing it and often I'd be sent away because it was that scary. Now I'm older of course, the scary bits are just rather inconveinient. 

The series really needs a reboot. A remake of the first game, and an entirely new set of sequels with a storyline that will actually make me show interest and concern for the characters. It needs to foccus more on immersion and storyline than combat and gameplay. Multiplayer and Co-op kill off almost totally the horror/terror element to the game so that simply needs to stop. Killing off every character within the space of a game also is a pretty big no if you want people to get attached to them or care about your series. The fact that the first game spends almost it's entirety making you scared of the evil cannibal guy and then F.E.A.R. 3 lets you play as him totally kills any vibes it might have had as a horror title.

If I had to describe the whole series and this game in one word it'd just be dull or bland. The most interesting part of the whole F.E.A.R story, is when in F.E.A.R. 2 the main protagonist gets sexually used against his will. And that's purely out of the fact that it's the first time I've seen that conecpt in gaming; that such a thing happens to a guy, and not because it's actually interesting.

I think the biggest let down of all is that the game starts off with a pretty tactical theme, and as it progresses, the whole operational feel just goes to shit, which rather than immerses you, just makes you feel the developers needed an excuse to make the game way too simplistic. Everyone conveiniently seems to die ¬_¬

Tl;DR; dull game, ruined series, too many cannons, and everyone dies before you can care."

The AI do just about everything right and it leaves you wanting more... but that just never happens. Instead you're given some empty shell of a story and try hard jump scares that weren't even scary in 2005.

Everything is dark (literally almost pitch black - you have to use your flashlight all the time, which is annoying, because it needs to be recharged after a minute or so), repetitive and boring. Occasionally the game manages to be exciting, usually in the moment when you're shooting at someone. As soon as they are dead, it's the same boring crap again. Seriously Monolith, the game came out a year after Half-Life 2, and your idea of a FPS is a guy shooting up people in an office building for 4 bloody hours?

Not to mention the wonderfully paced narrative, which literally consists of your superior finding and losing the position of a certain bad guy about 11 times."
403,3,0.5736,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","As with most old PC games - where they've been re-released to modern systems through digital retailers without receiving any optimisation - I had to go through the motions of setting compatibility modes and downloading third-party patches before the game would launch. Once I had made the achievement of reaching the main screen I had to reset almost all of the keybindings, as they just weren't up to standard.

At first I noticed that F.E.A.R. really shows its age: the animations are quite wooden, especially with the main player's arms (seriously, this is something on-screen for the entirety of the game and they're as stiff as planks). The UI scaling is completely out of whack for larger resolutions, I can barely read the subtitles. It's like trying to read an 8pt font on a 50 inch monitor.

I know this is common in FPS games but having the camera located in the player's chest makes me feel a little like like Tom Cruise on the set of his next major blockbuster. I believe this has also caused problems during firefights as enemies will aim at my head, and be able to hit me while I'm crouched, even though it appears that I'm behind cover. This issue persists through the ages, even appearing in games such as PAYDAY 2.

I'm uncertain as to what technicality is causing frame-rate issues while enabling slo-mo but activating v-sync in the graphic options has improved this greatly. I can now use slo-mo without the screen stuttering like crazy. There are still a number of issues, such as the camera flying through geometry during short cut-scenes. There was also one instance where enemies were able to shoot through walls from across the map, luckily this was a once-off occurrence.

The physics engine is great, it's extremely satisfying to blast enemies and see their ragdolled bodies flying through the air, especially in slow motion. The only problem with this is that the physics is applied to so many environmental objects that I feel is unnecessary, such as cans and general rubbish, which can sometimes cause these objects to spasm violently when they're stepped on by the player.

Whilst the graphics of F.E.A.R. don't particularly hold up, the game is over 10 years old as of writing, I found that the lighting and physics are still something to be admired. Even modern games still can't achieve this level of quality. Enemy spawn positions can be odd at times, where a number of soldiers will spawn right in front of my eyes on a single point. Despite the oddity it became convenient since a single, well-placed shotgun blast can take out 2-3 at once.

Everything, from the physics, the silent protagonist, and the level and sound design - especially of the enemies when they communicate - all remind me heavily of Half-Life 2 but I found that the A.I. in F.E.A.R. is much more intelligent and unpredictable. They would often outflank me, draw me into a bottleneck, and manoeuvre in such a way that I'd end up missing them only to end up dead. There are also certain special enemies that remind me of BioShock's splicers and Big Daddy's, although their appearances are short-lived.

Even though I love linear games I found F.E.A.R. to be far too linear, it's a straight up corridor shooter without much flavour. I also found the game to be very, very dark. I'd often run into walls or closed doors when my flashlight had run out of power.

There is a poor amount of variety when it comes to weapons and an even smaller pool of ammunition to go with them. I would often end up running out of ammo for my preferred weapon (pistol) very quickly. For some reason there is a seemingly unlimited amount of ammunition for the shotgun so I mostly relied on that when my other guns ran dry. I don't particularly appreciate there being a limit on having only three weapons at a time when there is already such a small variety of guns to choose from, I don't see why I can't just hold all of them for the sake of convenience. It's the same with the torch, why allow it to run flat if its recharge time is only a matter of seconds. I found these mechanics to be quite silly and limiting when their implementation was obviously to create some artificial difficulty and basic resource management system. It's a nuisance.

There isn't much to say for the sound design and soundtrack, it's all very ambient and atmospheric.

As for gameplay, it feels like I'm performing the same task over and over again... I'll enter an area, there will be a security lock-down happening, I'll be given the task to deactivate the security system and/or traps and then progress to next area... to be met by further security systems that must be deactivated in order to raise some gates, or activate elevators. To break up this monotony I'll be rewarded by either discovering a civilian or by being reunited with my team. All this progress I've made is soon wiped clean as I take two steps back and have to make up all that lost progress by scaling elevator shafts or taking back alleys. If I'm lucky I'll be extracted by another helicopter. The budget for disposable helicopters must be immense as each chopper somehow manages find itself in compromising situations and soon destroyed. As well as my soldier buddies always seeming to be sidetracked or incapacitated so that I'm forced to take the role as a one-man-army of the hour type hero. It starts becoming a little bit ridiculous and annoying, story-wise.

I do wish there was more focus on the supernatural elements and cut-scenes as they were very sparse, and the small amounts of interesting encounters that did happen weren't enough to break up the monotonous pacing of the story and gameplay. I found the slo-mo system to be a huge crutch for me, without it I was very easily overwhelmed by enemies. I actually feel like the player takes a higher amount of damage without it.

There was a point where the game's difficulty ramped up excessively where resources, such as med-kits and grenades, became much more scarce. Where before I had been able to hoard 10 med-kits at a time and keep a full supply of explosives, I was soon whittled down to nothing for long lengths and at the same time I was expected to handle hordes of special enemies. It soon became too much for me to bear.

Don't get me wrong, F.E.A.R. is a very atmospheric and nice looking game, especially for its time. It's simply not a very exciting or memorable experience, devoid of personality, so much so that I had to force myself to continue playing. I could no longer suspend my disbelief with all of the immersion breaking issues I came across.

I've resorted to using cheat codes for unlimited ammo and health so that I can experience the story and continue on with the expansions and later sequels."

There are moments of ghostly action, but they have zero impact on gameplay.  Conversely, the gameplay is rather irrelevant to the story.  The first couple times something spooky happens you're like omg what's going on, but once you realize there is no impact, no combat related to it, you just start blowing off the hauntings so the whole thing loses apeal.

i'm somewhat null to alot of stories and games these days because of scarring left behind. this makes it difficult for me to let myself feel much, especially when it's pretty obvious that no one is going to live and that shit is never gonna go to plan.

that means aside from the twist, it was easy enough to guess that the character was gonna end up in a shi* situation and that bad things would happen to good people you don't wanna see hurt. which closed me up. i didn't find much to be scary enough to make my hairs stand on end, but the could be because as a game character you know you can't die otherwise how would you play?

then theirs the fact that i was expecting some creepy stuff, but none of it wasn't anything i haven't seen before. 

mind you, this is my first time playing the game, back on release would i have been more freaked out due to being less exposed to other games like it? possibly...but i didn't play it then. which means i have to judge it on the here and now.

and my judgement is, aside from a few moments where i didn't see a erry monster coming at me from my corner i didn't really ever get scared. again i feel that i was emotionally guarded because i knew anyone i let myself get attached to would just die so that is a factor.

then, lets talk about AI. there were moments were they pressured you, but there were mostly alot of cheap shots. example, i'm in slow mo mode pounding a guy with bullets on the crappy AR and the guy still manages to get a good shot on me occasionally. often enough to make you think about health and cover even if he's the only guy standing.

 a)to me this a cheap move or lazy work on the dev's part. it breaks immersion. in a game like this, immersion matters a lot.
 b) the enemy, unless standing over your head on a walkway are completely silent. the only time you even know if someone is in the same small room as you is if you walk by them and get shot in the back.
 c) so the next point is, the sound of tracking enemies is crap.
 d) also their bullet sponges on hard or higher. it's not very bad though, you can still kill them in one clip, but when you get a gun that can literally melt everything but your bones it raises an eyebrow when you shoot a human in the chest and he could doubles over like he got punched in the gut.

3) level desing: you know, one thing i hate is getting turned around when i just wont to move on and shoot things. now sure, it's not entirely a shooter game, but it sure as he** is linier in level design. yet, i still can't make heads or tails and go around in circles because in some places it's alittle bit like a maze. then in another place, i spent 30 minutes in one small area trying to move on only to realize i'm suppose to jump off and over the ledge that looks perfectly like it goes nowhere execpt that it's a next level load point. i'll point out, that you get hurt jumping off of ledges in any other situation in-game so why the f*** would i think to jump off that one?

4) guns: the guns for the most part aren't bad, execpt that near the end of the game they remove your guns and stick you with the starter weapon. which is a good gun, but that's a BS move. FEAR isn't the only game doing this though, but i still wish they didn't. they aren't the best, personally i've played with better ""feeling"" guns. note: it was the end-game guns that i'm really complaining about. my remote bombs packed more punch than they did.

5) as far as i can tell, there is no level select or new game +, which is always a disappointment.

given the option, i'd rather play TimeShift again than this. the slow mo and puzzle are more brain food than the weak puzzles installed here. before you say there weren't any, there was...built into the maze level desings. 

i won't talk about graphics because it's acceptible for the time period, i played at supported resolutions. i do feel the game would have benifitted from a FOV slider though."

There is basically ONE enemy and they pass this off in the story as the soldiers all being clones.  Combine this with lackluster weapons and barren indoor levels and you have some VERY boring and repetitive combat that NO amount of ""bullet time"" can spice up.

It's a real thrill! Every time you shoot a guy and stagger him he will spray his gun which will inevitably headshot you or something and do massive damage. There is no replay value in this game. There is not even any play at all value in this game. Anyone that tries to tell you it is good because it is a ""classic"" is lying. Games like Goldeneye are good because they are classic.

427,0,0.5067,"read, control, continue, head, huge, spook, borderline, grenade, pew, review","F.E.A.R. is a standard first-person shooter that uses bullet time—that’s honestly all it is—which came as quite a surprise to me after reading the widespread reviews lauding it as one of the greatest shooters of all time. The plot is the typical what-has-science-done, with an Evil Corporation (as if there were any other kind in video games) in pursuit of engineering super soldiers. So a psychic military commander sends his puppet soldiers to take over Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) headquarters, a warehouse emporium of weaponry, medikits, and indestructible office equipment. Enter the nameless, mute protagonist, as part of a special army unit designed to face paranormal threats, and his squad mates, who are consistently separated, injured, and subject to all manner of contrived reasons to keep them from interrupting the solo FPS design. “You’re just going to send him in alone???” the radio crackled for the umpteenth time. 

The gunplay was praised again and again as being spectacular, but it’s just a typical FPS experience. F.E.A.R.’s own iteration of the arsenal with which any FPS fan is familiar functions exactly as expected, with one exception; kicking people is far more damaging than multiple machine gun rounds piercing through their torsos. The only distinguishing feature of the gameplay is its infinitely accessible bullet time mode, which trivializes every encounter throughout the entire game, even on the hardest difficulty. Shifting in and out of bullet time mid combat is pretty, but nothing near the level of mind-blowing so universally spouted from critics. It is by no means bad; it’s decent, but only that.

Enemy AI was next on the list of sheer adulation, and was claimed to be “some of the best AI in shooter history.” Imagine my surprise when armored soldiers, who make up 80 percent of the game’s enemies, loudly proclaimed through their megaphone helmets that they were throwing a grenade at me, which then detonated two feet in front of them. I don’t remember if any of them ever did manage to hit me with a grenade, but I do know they were constantly informing me of what they were going to do, or how many of them I had killed. And for some reason, whether I was hiding behind a box, retreating, or charging head on, they would constantly shout at me, “HE’S TRYING TO FLANK US!” It’s not their fault, I suppose; someone built their armor with megaphones in the helmets… but weren’t they supposed to be psychically coordinated soldiers?

I did begin to feel a certain attachment to these armored soldiers, for all their loud, bumbling ineptness. There were many times they could’ve had the drop on me, if only they had not shouted, “SHIT!!!” or something like that when they spotted me. At one point, an armored truck full of them tried to run me over, but when I moved out of the way, they just kept driving, right off a building. Sometimes one of them would shout to the other, “TAKE COVER!!!” to which the other, surrounded by hallways, doors, tables, and walls, would scream, “I DON’T KNOW WHERE TO GO!!!” I even started to let them have all the time they needed to awkwardly wiggle underneath fences or clamber over walls in plain sight of me before I gunned them down. 

Of course, no review of F.E.A.R. would be complete without mentioning the horror, something which critics across the board have deemed bowel-voidingly scary. But it just wasn’t. Throughout the game, several hallucinations occur that are supposed to be unsettling, but 99 percent of them can’t actually hurt you. With no real effect upon the player, and no way to interact with them, the visions take on a haunted house ride kind of feel—spooky happenings just outside the safety of a cart on tracks. I found myself startled once or twice upon turning around to see a little girl just behind me, but when I discovered that I could move toward and back away from her indefinitely to raise and lower the volume of the scary violins, I couldn’t help but laugh. 

The ever popular mechanism of discovered audio tapes takes the form of voicemails, but the majority of them are poor voice actors reading aloud passive aggressive corporate squabbles. They failed to flesh out the story to any further degree than what-has-science-done; the game as a whole never delivers on its narrative. Ambiguity is a useful tool in crafting horror, but F.E.A.R.’s story remains largely undeveloped by the end of the game. I think some developers wanted to make a standard action shooter but were also into Japanese horror films, so the result was a standard action shooter with Japanese horror elements that might as well have been delivered from a TV screen.

I will close with some of the non spoiler questions this game has left me to consider on my sleepless nights. Firstly, why do dead bodies sometimes randomly fly through windows, and why are there so many in the ceilings? ATC headquarters was taken over by psychically controlled soldiers, right? How did they even get the bodies up there in the first place? Or was it the little girl? Was she just stuffing them up through the tiles so they could conveniently fall down as I passed? And why does the protagonist spontaneously combust when he falls into pits? I did it several times out of disbelief, but sure enough, just before the screen went black, orange flames engulfed my entire body. What exactly are those shinless, tan men who float into me and pop like a fleet of suicidal balloons? And why do the armored soldiers sometimes blast off like rockets when I shoot them in bullet time mode? Machine gun fire shouldn’t send an armored body rocketing across a room, bouncing off walls and screaming.

I went into F.E.A.R. with high expectations, because almost everyone was saying that this game was amazing. But, and I'm NOT sorry to say, I was rather disappointed with this game.

The gameplay isn't anything special. The gunplay is actually pretty bad. There are games much older than this, such as the Half-Life games, with much better gunplay, and the slow-motion just gets repetitive after a while. Put simply, walking through corridors and shooting the same soldiers in slow-mo every few minutes gets old pretty fast.

The level design is some of the laziest I've ever seen. Nothing but dimly-lit grey corridors. And that's your lot!

Then, there's the story... Or lack thereof. Throughout the game, I had no freaking clue what was going on or what I was fighting for. The game makes no clear explanation as to what you're doing, or why. You're just placed in these random places and shoot shit, with the occasional paranormal... thingie that comes out of nowhere. There is ZERO narrative!

None of the characters were even remotely memorable. Most of them only make appearances that last mere minutes. I only remember one name, Norton Mapes. As for the main character, he was just some generic mute. Nothing more, nothing less.

Also, this game is pretty short! I managed to beat it in less than ten hours. And this was a full-priced game at launch? Inexcusable.

The one thing I give this game credit for though is the enemy AI. For a game from 2005, the enemy AI is top tier. The soldiers react almost instantly to your presence, even at small things like your flashlight, and their accuracy is pixel-perfect. They don't miss a single shot at all! But that's just about the only thing this game has going for it, really.

Overall, I think this game is seriously overrated. It's gameplay wasn't anything special, the story was crap, and it was ridiculously short. But I have played worse. It isn't horrible, but it certainly hasn't aged well and I wouldn't play it again."

440,3,0.8291,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","F.E.A.R.: I’m not F.E.E.L.ing it…

When F.E.A.R. came out back in 2005 it was considered to be a game changer! Not on the level of Half-Life 2 or anything, but, people loved it! They always talked about how good it was. The horror elements were well done, the enemy AI was fantastic, the shooting was super great, and the graphics were amazing. You had to have a pretty beefy computer to play this game.

Maybe back in 2005. Because, man has this game aged poorly. Like, really poorly.


Not only does the game look... bad. It’s really not that fun either, sorry to say. Now this is probably due to the fact that I have ten years of games between the release of F.E.A.R. and now to compare it to. I can definitely see how, at the time, F.E.A.R. would have blown my thirteen year old mind. But as it stands, in 2015, F.E.A.R. is very underwhelming. It feels like a pretty standard shooter, with some cool bullet time and horror elements thrown in. 

I’m sure if I could force myself to play more I would probably get something out of it. But as of four hours into the game all I’ve done is: run through long hallways murdering puppet soldiers in an industrial complex, and an office building, while occasionally being frightened by a little girl. And... she doesn’t show up all that much, sadly.

To be fair, there were moments where I was genuinely enjoying myself. Rolling up on fools with a shotgun and slo-mo sliding into them while tearing them to shreds with buckshot is really cool. Like the first 50 times. Then it just becomes an easy “I win” button. Now, the horror aspects of this game were the main draw for me. And trust me, they can be genuinely disturbing and definitely made me jump more than once. But, as you play through the game you can see the seams at the edges of the experience. After about two hours I could tell when the game was going to go from ‘action’ to ‘horror’ just by level design.

Big well lit area funneling into a small dark hallway? Scare incoming. Better turn on my flashlight!

Eventually I just got bored with the game. There wasn’t enough of the creepy to keep me interested, and the ten year old shooting and level design weren’t doing F.E.A.R. any favors.

I honestly spent a large chunk of my four hours trying to figure out where the hell I was supposed to go. Which is the weird thing, because this game is quite linear. Sadly it’s very easy to get turned around, and everything looks the same… Plus sometimes the level designers expected you to intuit where to go without any indication. I felt like I was playing Duke Nukem, or Doom, considering how many times a seemingly decorative A/C vent was actually the way forward. 

I hear this game gets pretty crazy towards the end, but I can’t bring myself to continue any further. I wanted to try and complete every game I reviewed for this project… but, I don’t really want to spend anymore time on this one. Especially considering I have over one hundred more to do.

I think the coolest part of F.E.A.R. is probably the firefights. Although the shooting is rather lackluster compared to today, the effects of your combat are really cool. Glass will break, the walls, floor, and ceiling will have large chunks blown out of them. And large amounts of dust, that actually lingers, will be kicked up. It forces you to move around, and looked really cool. Plus the bloody aftermath was always satisfying...

The dust tech is the most impressive part of this game to me. Seriously.

Honestly, this game reminds me a lot of Psi-Ops, an old game for the PS2. It revolved around a paranormal military task force fighting against another paranormal military group. It had all of the same hyper violence, weird psychic powers, creepy horror segments, and strange meat puppet soldiers. Expect I played it at the time... so I liked it.

It’s not that FEAR is bad… It’s just like an old movie. It was amazing when it came out! It’s just, going back and looking at it compared to ‘modern’ releases, it just doesn’t hold up.

Luckily I picked F.E.A.R. up on sale for like $2.75. If you’ve never played FEAR and always wanted to. Watch a let’s play. Or, if you absolutely have to play it, grab it on super-sale. It’s… really dated.

It have a little spooky aspect which is the only redeemable feature in the whole game. Slow motion to help with the game, other than that don't expect more. I forced myself to play this after 2 hours to watch those spooky scenes during the game but I couldn't reach 5 hours. Graphics are dated, all assets are copy pasted during the whole copy pasted levels. You may like this game if you want but this is my opinion. AI can't see you when you stand above them on iron stares. AI on hard = adding granades to them to flush you out of your hiding place.There is no way in Hell this would be 2005 game of the year since a lot of great games released during the same year.

Otherwise, it's a boring and repetitive shooter.  Combat feels very dated and stiff. It's basically your character just fighting the exact same enemies over and over in different sections (industrial, office, etc) and the main storyline is meh at best.  Occasionally you will encounter phones with voicemails to listen to, but if you skip them you still miss nothing for the story.

I also find all the particle effects to be completely overdone and annoying.  During larger scale combat sequences, there is so much dust and whatnot that you cannot even see what you are shooting at, yet the enemies somehow can nail you every time.  

Meh...I FEAR that this dated game sucks."

As usual, it’s hard to decide whether to recommend or not when I know others will not be as bothered by certain things as I am, but it is my review after all so here are my issues with FEAR:

1.	It did not age well. The sky looks terribly flat and the level design consists mostly of gray corridors. 
2.	The game clearly has 2 gimmicks which it wants you to see as soon as possible: the slow-motion effect and flashy gun particle effects.  That is its thing, its selling point and it’s not enough to make a whole game. The game becomes boring after a while.
3.	The girl from The Ring. The story of FEAR is actually not that bad but the antagonist is clearly the little girl from The Ring horror film and, again, it feels too on the nose.
4.	The gameplay is the ultimate example of a classic PC first-person shooter where you have a health bar that goes down as enemies hit you, and the enemies WILL hit you the very moment they see you from a mile away, which feels unnatural. In a shooter like this, the game becomes about the health bar management and I hate that gamy feel. 

The good stuff: well, some of the jump scares are quite creative and overall the graphics are not the worst I guess. 
The AI, despite the annoying super-accuracy and reflexes, is quite smart. Enemies will throw grenades at your last known position and jump over obstacles (smarter than some of the modern AI in games).

IN CONCLUSION, I bet it was cool in its day but I am getting incredibly tired of this game. And to prove that this is not just about this being an old game, I am also playing Doom 3 that was released a year earlier and it is a way more interesting game despite having many similar problems.

Update: I uninstalled the game and feel sooo much better now. I was forcing myself to give another try because it is a well-known game, but holy moly, am I happy I don't have to play that grey goo anymore."

459,1,0.5631,"run, work, fix, even, issue, try, make, problem, new, fps","This game is frequently hailed as one of the only truly scary FPS games made.  A game rich in atmosphere, and setting, that drives you to keep playing it.

But I just don't see it.  I have tried to get into this game.  I want to like it.  But I just can't.  I can't now, and I couldn't ten years ago when it first came out, the first time I tried to play it.  Nothing in the game, nothing in the story, makes me want to keep playing.

That is not to say the game doesn't have its strong points.  The AI in this game is top notch, and holds up well even today.  The enemies will try to flank you, surround you, they react to being seen, being shot at.  They'll throw grenades, they'll fire from cover.  They really are some of the best AI I have ever seen.  And the game should be played if just for this alone.  (Edit: This only applies to the first enemy type you see, the soldiers.  When you start getting to the invisible robot ninjas (I am not kidding), the good AI goes right out the window.  I witnessed two of them performing a Scooby-Doo routine of running back and forth randomly between the rooms in a hallway, simply because I had my gun pointing down the hallway so they wouldn't come at me.  It was hilariously pathetic.)

But there are also problems.  There's no on-screen indication when you take a hit.  Your life goes down, and that's it.  So you could be in a fire fight, shooting from cover, and thinking you're doing well, only to find yourself on the edge of death.  Because you didn't know that the enemy was hitting more shots than not.  Or didn't realize that someone had gotten to your side, and was free to open up on you.  That severely hurts this game.  (Edit: There actually IS a visual indicator.  But it is on the very edge of the screen, and flashes by so quickly that I literally did not notice it for more than three hours of gameplay.)

They also made a bizarre choice with the weapon and ammo mechanic.  In an effort to make you switch weapons often (you can only carry three at a time), when picking up a new weapon it comes with a full magazine loaded, and enough ammo for a second.  However, if you already have a weapon of that type, when you pick the new one up for more ammo, you get roughly a third of a magazine.  Of course, you can game this system by first tossing your weapon on the ground, picking up the new one (which is now reloaded for you), and then picking up your old one with all the ammo you had before.  You'll start to do this very rapidly once you find a weapon you like.

Also, despite being only ten years old, the game does not run well on modern systems.  Disabling ""HID-Compliant Device"", and in my case ""HID-Compliant Vendor-Defined Device"" is required to make the game run at anything higher than 6-7 FPS.  So don't expect your gaming keyboards and mouse to function when you play this game, and be prepared to reenable those when you have finished.

There are other problems.  The game forces ""Letterboxing"" when it does cinematics.  Even if you're using a wide-screen monitor and resolution.  So expect to see black bars and the top and bottom of an already wide-screen image.  And the FMV cut-scenes are letterboxes as well, but set in 4:3 ratio, so they'll be displayed with a box with black bars on all sides.

So what about the story?  Well, this was before the ""scary little girl"" trope was completely overplayed.  But even so, nothing in this seems to work.  There's a few pseudo jump-scares, and some places where the graphics will change on you into another, ""spooky"" scene.  But both Max Payne and even Postal 2 of all things had done this years before.  (Quick edit: The Postal 2 expansion that featured this was released the same year as F.E.A.R., but five months before.)  And to a better effect.  In fact, that might be one of the problems I had with this game ten years ago.  It so desperately wants to play like Max Payne, but with a horror twist (""Bullet Time"" - the slow motion effect - was featured in Max Payne as well).  But this game just didn't seem to push hard enough.

There's a level of interactivity... but it's so painfully limited that you notice more when you CAN'T do something than when you can.  You can only do anything with phones if they're already flashing with a voice mail message.  You walk by a radio and can't turn it on yourself, but some will spout something directly from the Exposition News Network, letting you know a plot update... and then promptly fall silent again.  There are blocked doors, sometimes you can figure out a way to open them, but frequently they can't be.  And, again, to put in perspective as to the environment when this game came out, System Shock 2 and Deus Ex had both been out for half a decade before this game was released.

The game shows its age now.  But it wasn't fresh and exciting when it came out.  F.E.A.R. - First Encounter Assault Recon (which, BTW, Assault and Recon are kinda mutually exclusive, but they had to fit that name in somehow) was a game that was trying to just exist.  They may have had a grander goal in mind for it, but they didn't put the effort in to see it through.

The game also used Gamespy for its Multi-player, which means the Multi-player aspect of the game no longer functions at all.

So, no, I can't recommend this game.  I find nothing in it that makes me want to keep playing it, so I don't feel comfortable suggesting anyone else try it either.

Update:  I am still trying to play through the game, and oh god, it is getting worse and worse as I play.  I think I submitted this review way too early.  And I will probably have to keep updating this as I play.  This game is bad.  Downright incompetent in many aspects.  There are updates above to what I mean.  But here's another:  The interactivity, the phones with messages?  Absolutely no thought was put into where to place these phones.  Now, remember, you are hearing voice mails sent to specific people.  Early in the game, the phones are actually in offices.  But when you get to the office level, these phones are hanging off the walls in common areas.  And the first piece of actual information you get from a phone is one hanging in a wall in an area with three desks.  THIS is who you call with the important information, not a CEO, not security, but three desk jockeys sharing one phone.  The game designers, and level designers, did not put any effort into this game at all.

Update 2: I have finished the game.  The last couple levels were better than the rest of the game in that they had a hint of creativity to them.  But only a hint.  And you had to wade through hours of filler to get there.  This is the video game equivalent of an Asylum movie.  Another game I forgot to mention above, in the ""games that were out first and did it better"", Doom 3 beat this game by a year, and did the spooky corridor shooter - with bits of information parsed out through personal messages - better.  This game is just a slow, painful drudge of a boring, poorly paced, generic shooter.  Avoid it."

Compared to the fights of even Half-Life 1, it is soooo boring.

The very artificially inserted cut-scenes couldn't make me continue through this game. After 30 minutes of shooting generic, poorly programmed AI, a single scary moment couldn't make me feel like this was a horror game."

I have been wanting to play this game for a while, being a general fan of survival horror and shooters. I was also pleasantly surprised by Monolith's other 2005 shooter, Condemned.

F.E.A.R. has some nice gunplay, the slow-motion effects hold up well, and the presentation is consistently good throughout its sound design, score, and graphics. It also has some surprisingly good AI for a 10-year old product. I can see why in 2005 it was a hit in the Hollywood Action Game genre.

But we've played 10 years of horror and shooter games since then.

I recommended Condemned (and still do) because it does things differently that are still pretty unique today. It focuses on melee combat. Guns are scarce, as should be the case in survival horror. It has forensic tools and a mystery to solve. Combined with a very intense atmosphere (especially in the last couple of levels), it's an imperfect but very interesting specimen.

F.E.A.R. doesn't have any elements that haven't been recycled and improved through countless iterations after it. I guess bullet time stuff is not that common, but slow motion itself doesn't save the game from feeling boring and tired.

The biggest issue comes from the total lack of atmosphere. Many shooters are gray and brown, but this one's just gray. Early on in the game after fighting through 14 warehouses, I thought to myself sarcastically, ""Well at some point I'm gonna fight through a sewer and an office complex I guess."" The next two main sections of the game were a sewer and an office complex. There is also a dilapidated apartment building to vary things up. The level design feels straight out of the 90's corridor shooter rulebook - every room and path at right angles, endless amounts of zigzagging corridors way too long to be realistic, random recycled assets such as barrels and crates, and very few unique rooms that feel any different from the previous and the next. In fact, while writing this sentence, I was thinking of the original DOOM as reference, and I can safely say that there are more memorable design choices with its maps than in this game. Half-Life 2 came out a year earlier and still tops F.E.A.R. in every respect.

It's a shame, because I played this game hoping that the atmosphere is precisely what I would enjoy; I like the idea of a shooter influenced by Japanese horror. Sadly, it feels like a dated and drab military shooter with a couple of hallucinations peppered throughout to break up the monotony. There were times where I had actually forgotten the scary little girl even existed since the game was so focused on its monotone combat encounters. When the girl does appear, it can be mildly startling at times, but there aren't any real good jump scares. Not one. The major hallucinations, where your character suddenly finds himself in another place, lack tension because you quickly learn that most of them can't hurt you. They're just interactive cutscenes with some bloody and/or fiery walls and a few allusions to your character's role in all of this.

F.E.A.R. has a decently dramatic (albeit cliché) backstory, but it is revealed too late and without any impact through the use of !!! radio comms as exposition. For a game that throws you into an alternate dimension every half hour, these dimensions could have been used to *show* the drama in a much more visceral way. And if the game's central mystery/twist was trying not to be obvious, it failed completely.

So there you have it. The game's central strength is its action combat, which still isn't that bad but nevertheless clunky by today's standards. The story and voice acting are useless, and the disappointing horror elements are kept to a tensionless minimum. That's why in *2015*, without any nostalgia glasses on, it is not worth playing F.E.A.R.


Note: Steam only sells F.E.A.R. along with its expansions. While a nice bonus, they were made by a different developer, and their stories were subsequently contradicted and de-canonized by F.E.A.R. 2. For this reason, I won't play them. I guess I might, I dunno. Yeah I probably will. Definitely."

This game has a bug when the system has multiple ""HID-Compliant Devices"", reducing the framerate to around 22fps after ten or fifteen minutes of gameplay. The only known solution/workaround is to disable such devices in your Windows Device Manager. This is an awful solution, as it can disable important devices the user uses, and may require a reboot.

For this reason alone, I do not recommend this game.

However, if you manage to keep the framerate at acceptable levels, or if such low framerate does not bother you; then you can find an enjoyable experience. The gameplay itself is good, the sound effects and voice acting are also good, the in-game music and cut-scene-ish effects help delivering a great atmosphere. The graphics are somewhat dated by today standards, but are not bad. I didn't like the gunplay that much (imprecise guns, bullet-sponge feeling), and I prefer using the standard pistol most of the time."

Even on normal difficulty this game can be pretty tough if you don't find the ammo or healthpacks that you WILL need, but after dropping to easy difficulty, it was near impossible to die and the FPS aspect got really boring. Although it had some creepy moments and got me once or twice with a jumpscare, there definitely wasnt enough ""horror"" to balance out the FPS to really consider this as ""one of the best horror games"".

Overall I would give it a 5/10 simply because it became so repetative I just got too bored to be interested. I also want to add that I hve no idea why this game would be tagged or considered a 'horror game.' The atmosphere is non-existent, mostly due to poor lighting, there are no scary enemies or monsters. The only thing that scared me was...wait...nothing scared me. The 'horror' aspect was entirely made of jumpscare...al three or four of them. The amount of shooting the same 2 models of guys un the same corridor in the same building with the same guns for over five hours made the 'scary' parts so insignificant I can't see why they didn't just remove them.

The thing is, the horror in this game is mostly just creepy; I remember ONE memorable scare (on a ladder) but everything else was just... eh. The ""scary parts"" are preceded by sound effects that aren't sudden but ease in, making it not scary. Many times I would hear this creepy sound coming in, then look around for something scary and see a figure walking around a wall. Oooh. 

As a shooter, I like the way the guns work and the bullet-time reflex slomo stuff is fun to play around with. As a story, I thought it was interesting but not compelling. As for gameplay in general, there is a lot of backtracking and it can be frustrating walking around looking for the exit to the next section. The enemies are boring with the occasional ""boss"" every once in a while. No monsters or scary things to shoot at here - just soldiers. Lots and lots of soldiers. 

The game took me about me about 8 hours to finish on normal difficulty. Overall, if you're looking for a shooter you can play when you want to shoot stuff, this game is pretty fun. The slomo fighting is probably the best part of the game. If you're looking for a horror game, don't bother with this one. It isn't scary and doesn't really have a lot of horror actually in it. There's a bunch of blood and skeletons but nothing actually horrifying.

490,3,0.7125,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","I cant force myself to finish the last few hours of this game. I have no idea how this got any kind of critical success.

Lets start with the port. One of the most bug ridden ports I have seen. A known bug with logitech devices prevents the game from even being playable unless you disable functions of your logitech devices while you play. 

Quite a few video and audio bugs. 

There is mouse support in menus thanks god, but many options lack a drop down menu which will require you to suffle through all the options to get the ones you want.

Now for the game itself.

This is not a horror game. The attempts at scares in this game are downright laughable. If you buy this game to have a horror expirence you will be very dissapointed.

It is to easy! The AI is just brian dead and it throws ammo, health, and armor at you in spades. Never did I drop below the allowed amount of 10 health packs on hand.

The enemy variety is so low. You fight the same guy 90% of the game who gets a slight re-skin occasionally.

The level design is just awful. To many times did I have to figure out where the hell I was supposed to be going because the office that 50% of the game takes place in, was designed by fucking Daedalus (google him). Usually I give structures in games some leeway because some sacrifices have to be made to make it interesting to play in. However, the buildings in this game are to far out there to believe could actually exsist. 

The guns are boring. You get a choice of 4 main guns (basically 3 machine guns and a pistol), a plasma gun that you get maybe 20 rounds for the entire game, or a rocket launcher which you also get no ammo for.

The story has some intrest to it but I dont feel its good enough to wade through this game to find out what happens. Whats worse is this is supposed to be the best in the series. Im not sure if I will be giving the other 2 games shot but since I already have them I might as well. Hopefully they will prove to be a better expirence than this thing."

I run Windows 8, which I know many of you don't like but it was the only operating system available to me at the time, and I've never had an issue running any games except for maybe a few minor graphical issues in Sim City 4.  F.E.A.R. starts up with the standard copyright and logo screens, but when I get to the Nvidia logo it freezes.  Sometimes I can reach the log out feature on my computer, but most of the time I have to restart my computer because the game either stops me from reaching any other options or it keeps me from using task manager.

No personality at all, bland enemies, bland guns, bland characters, generic gameplay, lame tacked on bullet time mechanic that feels like a forcefull addition just cuz someone thought it's cool as opposed to a fleshed out game mechanic.

Don't expect to be scared it's probably one of the least scary FPS you can find, I don't really hold that against it, just an FYI.

This feels like one of those russian mass market FPS games that you get thrown in your face fo free when you buy a magazine or something.
 No real enemy variety, expect to fight special forces and security guards all game and they don't do anything other then move, shoot and occasionally throw a granade. 
Add bland generic guns to that and every firefight feels the same and boring as hell. Here's how it works, you walk around the corner, see bad guys, activate bullet time, kill bad guys, repeat for 6 hours.
Levels are bland sequences of empty corridors with no real atmosphere or character to them.

Good points: AI is pretty decent, graphics and effect were pretty good for it's time, story is interesting enough but it's told in such a way you won't care about it at all, since all the ingame characters are kindergarden level of ""black guy"", ""fat guy"", ""asian chick"" and offcourse ""radio boss man"".

However, this doesn't seem to be the case, I'm glad they learned from their mistakes here for their second game, but the checkpoint method (although useful) is so obtrusive, if you're trying to get a horror game, make sure it's immersive so as to keep the person feeling like they're actually in some danger, rather than stopping the game completely so you can save. Nothing takes you out of a game more than the entire game stopping mid stride to save and F.E.A.R does this perfectly. Not only this, but the combat is completely shit, I know it's an older game, but there is literally no indicator for being hit by a bullet other than your life meter way down in the corner (which in the heat of combat you wouldn't even glance at) and because of this, you just die, outright, I didn't even think that the enemies were hitting me, what couldn't make a hitting noise? Even a little red spot on the screen when a bullet hit you? Hell even after it hit you just something to fucking show you just got shot, nobody just keeps walking when they get shot as if nothing happened.

It plays....pretty well. If you want a shooter game that makes you think a bit and the game is on sale, I guess that's fine. However, this game is extremely repetitive with little changes in the environments. Also, it is not scary or intense at all. 

I will note that I went from Half-life 2 right to this. Comparatively, this game is terrible. On its own compared to all games in existence, it's adequate.

Hey, if it is $1 or $2, grab it. $5 is pushing it a bit in my opinion."

524,3,0.8869,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","This game is strange.

Well, Its supposed to be. But i don't know if i like the graphics or not. Mostly you're walking around in office spaces and plain corridors and suddenly you might be outside for awhile. Common soldiers to kill. And suddenly you encounter killing machines, and then you arent? It's like plain.. cool!... plain... cool!
You easily take damage if you run into things, and this is where your slo-mo ability comes to use, which replenish when not in use. Weapons are OK i guess, but i didn't always find a clear distinction of what worked best in a situation.
This is one of those hard to understad stories, but it was still kinda interesting. Not that i was 100% sure what was going on all the times, but i it seems to have a complicated backstory, which is cool.

Some of the biggest problems were level design flaws that could make you stuck and looking for that ""hidden"" ventilation to get further. I personally had some lag-issues after awhile, which were fixed by resetting the game. Not sure what was up with that.

This game felt kinda like Half-Life in the gameplay. It's an OK game. I can't recommend it, but it's not bad either."

527,3,0.8628,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","Dear GenEric,

This is you from the past. The last time you played this game, you navigated an endless series of crates and reused assets. You didn't leave the sewers until chapter three, except in chapter four where it put you back in the sewers. You had five possible weapons to choose from and only two of them were good. I don't care how cool you think the combat looks, or how the enemies might respond to your actions like noise or flashlight usage. They can still see you in complete darkness. It's not worth it."
528,3,0.5441,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","FEAR is a mediocre shooter and not a horror game. If you're looking for a scary game look elsewhere. It took about 8 hours to finish and only about 5 mins of that even tries to scare you. The gameplay is passable but repetitive. The graphics feel dated. They aren't bad, just dull and empty feeling alot of the time. I think I got this and the other two games at one point for 15 bucks. Probably worth it as a bundle if the other games are decent (which I haven't played yet). By itself, I wouldn't pay more than $2.50 for it. Very meh."
529,3,0.7607,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","In between the worlds of the twitchy PC shooter and the more set-piece driven modern FPS, F.E.A.R fails to impress on a lot of levels. PC gamers of the mid-00's may wax lyrical about how F.E.A.R looked back in the day but separated from the hype that surrounds a new graphic showpiece F.E.A.R is a drab, dull shooter that occasionally manages to create some atmosphere, but mostly feels like squandered potential. No amount of great particle effects and sharp AI can make up for weak weapons and one endless office building."

532,4,0.4643,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price",A mediocre FPS at best.  It is quite unimaginitve and goes with the run of the mill scare tactics in any kind of spooky / fear based game.  All the levels are just one big tube with no real choice other than forward or backward.  Go in with low expectations and you will not be dissapionted.
533,4,0.4009,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price",Edited review. Not worth 55$ since they now force you to purchase the entire trilogy. Figure out a way to play the first game at a decent price and don't bother with any of the others.
534,4,0.5702,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price","As far as ""fear"", this game's developers must have been 10 years old. The ""scary"" bits are comical at best, and I don't understand the cult following this game seems to have. That said, F.E.A.R. is a solid FPS that seems to ageas well as warm milk. It does introduce some rather interesting FPS mechanics with the ""relex"" slo-mo ability, but nothing that hasn't been done before and better. Fun and good for a casual run or two, and definately worth the 2.49 I paid on sale. No more. My advice: If you want a scare, find a better game; If you want a b-movie level of horror and some interesting FPS mechanics, wait for a sale."

538,3,0.9437,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","Lets call this 'baby's first horror game.'  Game is divided up into 'horror' and 'action' segments.  Meaning in the first you see creepy things and in the second you shoot clone soldiers.

AI reactivity is pretty good, even if all encounters have scripted beginnings (enemies wont spawn until you reach certain points, the game gives you rocket launchers before you fight robots, etc).  They throw grenades and quickly flank you.  There really isn't any stealth potential aside from catching enemies in the middle of their scripts.

Horror elements are only scary if you jump easily.  Game objects will fly across the room, random blood pools, lights flicker, or you have a weird hallucination, but nothing will attack you.  The only times you need to shoot in horror segments are against slowly moving phantasms, against ninjas (which only show up in two segments), and at the very end of the game where phantasms appear outside of hallucinations.

Not too difficult on 'hard', an OK game for cheap."

540,3,0.598,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","I got to say, I'm a little disappointed in F.E.A.R. I was expecting more horror from the get go, and then when they mention the protagonist has psychic powers, I was thinking it was going to be an updated Second Sight. But, alas, all you get is bullet time, which you will abuse the crap out of. Every level is just dull, maze-like complexes with a constant skirmishes between yourself and an unending army of bland, generic clones. Every now and then there's a very predictable and reused jump scare. Occasionally, you'll get a  creepy thing getting dragged around a corner, but often you miss these because you weren't looking in the right direction, so you just get a musical cue.

On the whole, I was hoping for The Ring, but with guns. In then end I was miserably disappointed by:

Being able to shoot ghosts. Seriously, it takes all the horror out of the game if you can just shoot everything. There's no feeling of helplessness or panic, just another wave of enemies."
