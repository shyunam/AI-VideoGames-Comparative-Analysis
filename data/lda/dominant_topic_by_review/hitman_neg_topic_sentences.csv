Very much a long time fan, a beautiful game, but, for the love of god there are some things that are so unforgiveable.

The settings are amazing, so much detail, hidden little pieces all over the place.

The story is brilliant, played out over 1, 2 and now 3 explaining, who 47 is, brilliant and I never saw some of it coming.

The characters are fully fleshed out and the hits, brilliantly executed, BUT.....

The AI, ye gods, when will IOI listen to what the players have been saying?, it's just so shonky, it's not funny. NPC's that see you through the tiniest of cracks, through solid walls, hear ""silent"" take downs and investigate simply ""because"", or spot you with no reflective surfaces while with their backs to you. This isn't as if this is something new either, players have been reporting for YEARS how bad the AI is on the NPC's and IOI have done exactly nothing.

And now we have Freelancer mode. WTAF!!!

Put all those bugs into an unforgiving layout, then jack the bugs up to 11. It's not even funny. You get halfway or three quarters of the way through a syndicate campaign, kill the target, and because there are decoys, they take the decoys to an exit, there is NO indication they are a threat to you, you try to exit, and they kill you, no warning, just dead and that's hours of work ruined because, if you die the campaign is reset and IOI are too lazy or too stupid, take your pick, to do their job properly.

A great game ruined by slap dash programming.

I had given a rating of 5, now dropped to 3. On Freelancer mode, if you die in normal mission you lose that map, take a hit on your money and lose your tools and weapons you took with you but not those you had at the safe house.

If you get killed on a ""Leader"" mission you loose ALL tools even at the safe house, financial hit, keep the weapons at the safe house, and the campaign is reset to the start.

Just killed on a regular mission, yet due to IOI's slap dash rush to use Freelancer mode to get more money, and releasing the update before it was ready, I got killed on a regular mission on the final level but got reset as if it were a Leader mission.

I'd call IOI incompetent, but they don't even rate that well. They've become another Dev more interested in milking their game for every last penny they can out of their customers, then getting the game right.

Just another bunch of morally bankrupt, self serving grifters.

You want to earn some points back IOI, let us turn off the voice of that sanctimonious, arrogant patronising Diana, the last thing I need to hear after your shonky piece of software has just screwed me over for the umpteenth time is her voice prattling on."

For 3 years, Hitman has been in limbo for any updates. Some of them are just great tweaks to the visual design, while others are great additions to the game. This includes: weapons. Get Jackson out of your defenders. Fight as you know how.

I've been playing for months, and today I'm finally a month away from the new game. Of course, there are new weapons and perks. But I have a lot of time to be free and have fun. Here are 5 things I could have done better. They are listed in no particular order, they are all good and can be found in the following order:

* Weapons for all characters, even low level

* Choose the light's color scheme and visual cues (you know, tell me if this particular blue smoke light is in a white van, etc.).

* New theme song, good credits

* More weapons per character with attachments to the weapons used

* Weapon decay system (after losing all weapons"

As an avid gamer who has always appreciated the stealth-action genre, I eagerly anticipated diving into the world of Hitman. However, after spending several frustrating hours with the game, I'm left utterly disappointed and underwhelmed.

Firstly, let's talk about the graphics. While they're not terrible, they're certainly not groundbreaking either. The environments lack depth and detail, often feeling like cheap cardboard cutouts rather than immersive worlds. Character models are stiff and lack personality, making it hard to connect with any of the NPCs.

But visuals aren't everything, right? Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn't make up for the lackluster graphics. Hitman boasts about offering players multiple ways to eliminate their targets, but in reality, it feels like you're stuck following a linear path with minimal room for creativity. The AI is laughably predictable, with enemies failing to react realistically to your actions. It's as if they're programmed to be oblivious to anything happening around them.

The controls are another sore point. They feel clunky and unresponsive, making even simple tasks like aiming and shooting a chore. Movement is sluggish, and the camera angles often hinder rather than aid your progress. It's frustrating to be constantly fighting against the controls, detracting from any enjoyment the game might offer.

And let's not forget about the story—or lack thereof. Hitman fails to deliver a compelling narrative, leaving players feeling disconnected from the world and its characters. There's no sense of urgency or stakes, making it hard to care about the outcome of your missions.

Overall, Hitman is a missed opportunity. With its lackluster graphics, uninspired gameplay, and forgettable story, it fails to live up to the hype. Save your money and invest in a game that offers a more satisfying experience."

69,3,0.3527,"run, crash, freeze, title, update, minute, driver, launch, stage, load","""HITMAN,"" part of the World of Assassination trilogy, is widely recognized for its intricate sandbox levels and deep strategic gameplay, where players assume the role of the iconic Agent 47. However, while the game boasts impressive technical achievements and gameplay mechanics, it also encounters several issues that might detract from its overall enjoyment for some players.

Episodic Release Structure: One of the primary criticisms of ""HITMAN"" was its episodic release structure. While this format aimed to provide players with a steady stream of content, it was met with mixed reactions. Some players felt that this fragmented the game's narrative continuity and delayed their ability to fully engage with the content. The episodic nature meant waiting periods between missions, which could disrupt the gameplay experience and immersion.

Performance and Technical Issues: Despite the high-quality graphics and detailed environments, ""HITMAN"" experienced various technical issues at launch and beyond. Players reported bugs that ranged from minor graphical glitches to more severe problems that affected gameplay, such as AI inconsistencies and mission-triggering errors. These issues could significantly impact the player's experience, especially in a game where precision and flawless execution are crucial.

Repetitive Gameplay: While replayability is often cited as a strength due to the multitude of ways to complete missions, some players found the gameplay to become repetitive. To achieve high scores and complete all challenges, replaying the same level numerous times is necessary, which can feel tedious and monotonous for those looking for a more varied and continuously evolving gameplay experience.

Lack of Narrative Depth: The episodic format also affected the game’s narrative, which some players felt was too sparse and disjointed. Those accustomed to more story-driven games might find ""HITMAN""'s narrative lacking, as the focus primarily rests on gameplay mechanics and level design rather than story development.

Limited Content at Launch: When ""HITMAN"" initially launched, the content available was limited, with more missions and locations released gradually over time. This staggered content release left early adopters feeling like they had purchased an incomplete game, leading to dissatisfaction among players who expected a full game experience from the outset.

Conclusion

In conclusion, while ""HITMAN"" offers a sophisticated and immersive stealth gameplay experience with beautifully crafted levels and a high degree of player freedom, it is not without its flaws. The episodic release format, technical issues, repetitive gameplay, underdeveloped narrative, and sparse initial content can detract from the game's overall appeal. These factors are important considerations for players who value a seamless and comprehensive gaming experience from day one."

However, this version is busted with no progression carry over, no upgrade path to WOA and no possibility to get missing DLC.

This version is not the GOTY version so even getting this for free there are extra missions that cannot be played because it is locked as DLC... which is impossible to obtain because Steam scrubbed it from the store.

There is no upgrade path because Hitman 2 is also scrubbed from the store, the only thing on the store is Hitman WOA which means that I would have to pay IOI again to get the definitive version with no discount. Additionally, even if I were to get WOA, progression is not carried over so that is even less incentive to get WOA.

78,4,0.7313,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go","Gentlemen, this is a very confusing situation, I'll explain it now.

Initially, IOI wanted to make a full-fledged Hitman and planned to release it by 2017-18. But the publisher could not allow such a long-term construction, because 4 years have passed since the Absolute. It was decided to split the first half of the game into episodes, so that interest would warm up with each episode and the game could be released earlier. And so Hitman 2016 was rolled out. But that's not all. The developers quarreled with the publisher and went for free bread, but not for long, because they found a new publisher and he gave them a full deck of cards. As a result, IOI released Hitman 2 on November 9, 2018, which has Hitman 2016 fully embedded, yes, all missions from there and all DLC. This is exactly how HITMAN was originally conceived, Hitman 2016 and Hitman 2 are one full-fledged game. Therefore, do not buy Hitman 2016 now, buy Hitman 2.

No, I understand everything that the developers wanted to make a full-fledged game, but the publisher did not give it, but what should the players who bought Hitman 2016 do? But there are a lot of them. Why did they embed the first part into the second, making them one game? Moreover, then why don't they give Hitman 2016 owners a 50% discount on Hitman 2? Some kind of crap.

Here you went to the Hitman 2 menu, and there are 4 chapters: the prologue (those cardboard training sessions on a yacht with a Negro and a Soviet base with a chess player); hitman 1 (all missions from the 2016 game with all dlc, the presence of the most purchased version of Hitman 2016 is not required, buy HITMAN - GOTY Legacy Pack for 435 rubles and you will save a whole 1000 rubles); hitman 2 (completely new maps, new dlc); agent 0 (he was also in Hitman 2016). And you're like, ""Wat? Seriously? 1/4 new content? Sirisley?""

And what can I say about the Hitman 2 missions played by Early access holders? Yes, the missions are cool, everything is great and fun, the maps are big and there is a lot of variety. Buy Hitman 2, if you didn't take this episodic squalor. And if they did, well, what can you do, swear, drink tea.

What is the result? And h*rt knows him, it seems to be good, but he plays well. It feels like you've been fucked, but the new content mitigates the pain.

UPD: So the 3rd part in the Steam came out and it stands like a skyscraper from the first mission. Yeah, for these prices, the developers' wives should come to me and do m*no while I'm playing this game. It's just some kind of tin. We are waiting for the normal full version with all DLC at an adequate price. And if you are suicidal, you can buy Hitman 3 Deluxe Edition and DLC about sins, in the amount of 5.5 k rubles will be released. It's just a***. And if you have not bought the previous parts with all the additions, then you will pay 8.3 k rubles for the full version of part 3, since you need to take the Trilogy version and the Addon bundle with DLC about sins.

The game itself is certainly good, no doubt, but IOI's attitude towards its audience is tinny.

You know, when publishers were having nightmares about IOI, the prices were lower, the Russian language was at the start, everything worked, the episodic system as a whole could be forgiven. And now there is no publisher and everything has gone to the female reproductive organ. IOI, I grew up playing your games, you broke old's heart. I hate you now, this is the last part of Hitman and she's gone shitting herself. Thanks, go fuck yourself."

While the missions themselves are a huge improvement in terms of level design, graphics, AI, and assassination variations, I don't see these improvements as being any more than what one might expect based on improvements made generally throughout the industry. It seems that IOI have banked on the longevity of this game coming from people's willingness to replay these same 8 missions repeatedly until all of the myriad ways of killing the same 16 people over and over again wears thin enough for them to try out some community contracts. Unfortunately, after putting in some effort to try and complete the various challenges, I was just so fatigued from looking at the same handful of maps that I couldn't bring myself to play any more.

Also, why IOI decided to make single player challenges entirely dependent on their intermittent servers will forever haunt me as an example of inexplicable game design.

Here's 5 reasons why I don't recommend this game 
1. Graphics needed a lot more work for the PC Version as they looked more like console graphics for example PS4/Xbox One considering it came out in 2016 but even on the highest settings on your PC. 
2. Gameplay wasn't the best and felt lacklustre especially when trying to do stealth instead of using a lethal approach on missions because it kept making me be spotted by enemies way too easily even in a disguise after acquiring from a unconscious enemy or civilian. 
3. Combat is what primarily made me remove this game in the first game because the shooting and aiming was just horrific when trying to do a lethal approach and wanting to just kill your enemies 
4. No Health Bar or Anything to show how much health your Agent 47 has and it's very very hard to do a lethal approach because he dies very easily after 2-5 shots with a lethal weapon 
5. Presentation and Planning Methods needed more work aswell because that looks lacklustre as hell and didn't give much options when planning out missions 

If you're wanting to play the series avoid this game and jump straight to 3 instead of playing 1 and 2, then buy the all access pass which I only knew about very recently because the all access pass unlocks all the campaign missions from 1 and 2 which makes Hitman 3 a more enjoyable game most probably than the first two. Hopefully the graphics and gameplay are better on Hitman 3 than this game. 

Avoid this game if possible and jump straight to Hitman 3 (purchasing the All Access Pass to unlock the missions from 1 and 2)"

If you like this type of gameplay, go for it. I played the first 3 episodes and did not continue from that anymore, the hotel mission is just way too confusing, too big and overwhelming. I rather have Blood Money or Contracts reworked then playing this stuff. Its not that its super bad or something, it just feels way too similar to the Sniper-Assassin series by this point and thats why I got pretty fast bored with it. 

I did not even mention this whole cringe Episode Release in detail or the overpriced DLCs and the fact I need to unlock stuff ingame like items you can start with in your inventory or other startpoints, OH and you need to be always online to sync your save files or whatever, another stupid crap decision. Game was cracked day one and clown devs think its necessary to stick to this stupid DRMs for whatever reason. 

Just buy Contracts or Blood Money, this was probably the peak of the Hitman-Series. If you played those old games you know what I mean.

The final nail in the coffin for me was being punished for picking up a kitchen knife, from a busy stall in the middle of a market. 

With tons of people around how can anyone notice me quickly picking up a knife then instantly holstering it away. I literally picked it up then immediately hid it within a second. 

Yet a woman starts saying 'I need help!' Why? Because I picked up a knife for a brief second, when there's already millions of other distractions literally happening everywhere. 

I run to another area, yet somehow her 'pleas' travel faster across the map than I can. Armed guards (3 at a time) try and apprehend me so I have no chance of a fake surrender. 

All this escalation because I took one object in the game and get immediately punished for it. 

I like the open world setting for each mission and the immersion and tons of NPC's.. But the player shouldn't be punished for tiny decisions leading to a mission failure or just outright being gunned down.

I'm good at stealth games but it seems this game wants to push you down specific routes and when you try and experiment or have fun, you just get punished or end up having to gun down the entire level to stay alive and complete the mission.

155,0,0.8191,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","The social stealth is interesting, the levels — and approaches — are varied, but the performance is usually so terrible, that it undermines the great qualities.
At the beginning of each level you start in a new space you know nothing about, but over the level you explore it — likely a lot — you try to understand how you're supposed to complete the challenges, where to get the disguises, where items are. This first playthrough is usually the most satisfying — over a relatively short time you see something new, learn it and execute well, if not perfectly. The contrast makes the game so satisfying. It's probably most fun to try and get as many challenges as you can on your first try, as — at least for me — the subsequent playthroughs are usually less fun, and more about completing challenges, some of which are very frustrating. This change of objectives and enjoyment — from intrinsic motivation to extrinsic motivation —  is the opposite contrast, it makes the game way less satisfying and even downright depressing. This why I usually didn't bother revisiting levels much, as it just ruined the game for me. However you might want to play the levels, since for some mastery levels you gain new equipment for all locations, some of which is pretty interesting. This forcing of replayability by the game can really make you hate it. There are also many other side missions, which remix the targets, but this feels quite similar to completing extra challenges. I think that by trying so hard to make the player replay the missions the developers, unintentionally, made me hate the game.
The performance is horrible, most of the time the game doesn't use most of the resources the components of my computer provide and so just runs horribly. This isn't present in the tutorial levels, but in the proper levels it really becomes a massive problem. Also the graphics, while nice, never quite felt connected to me. I guess the poor antialiasing just made feel like the characters were in front of a green screen; it just never really blended into an immersive looking world. The game also occasionally bugs out, when you try to complete too many different challenges, making some kills impossible. The game also pretty much forces you to be connected to the internet and their servers, otherwise it won't keep your mastery progress, this DRM is horrible and very much unnecessary.
The story is fine, it does what it sets out do quite well, which is: telling a very simple contained story, which is part of the more important and more interesting world of conspiracy. While the story isn't THAT great, the dialogue of the NPCs in missions is just amazing, it's usually funny and interesting and makes the exploration of a level a treat.
Overall this game is probably better to play in Hitman 2, because I didn't see performance issues about that one (from what I know you can port the levels of the first game into the second); this fixes one of the game's major problems, but it — probably — still keeps it's many frustrating qualities."

157,0,0.5284,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I played a few missions but just couldn't get into this Hitman installment. It's impressive, from a technical point of view, with nice graphics, large maps and lots of NPCs to populate them. There are also a plenty of opportunities, special actions and potential paths to take. Lots to see and explore, in other words. These would seem to be perfect conditions for a fantastic Hitman game.
Nevertheless, the game doesn't click for me. It still feels empty and unengagig. It's doesn't feel particularly rewarding when you manage some feat of stealth or infiltration. At least in part, I think its because these things feel a bit too scripted. Infiltration on a rail. (To be fair, this also applies to earlier games to some extent) On the other side of the Hitman spectrum, the firefights are miserable as well. 47 used to be a good shot, now it's a bullet spray starting with the very first, supposedly well-aimed shot. Weapons also do very little damage, headshots included, so it's not that unusual to take a full magazine to kill someone. 47 also used to be able to take out entire contingents without having to scrounge for every round he could find. That's much too powerful, obviously, but the situation now feels like the exact reverse, balance-wise. 

Well, those are some of the nails in the coffin. The stake to the heart is the online / offline mode. I always opted out, playing my single-player game in offline mode. Thanks for giving me the option, I suppose. But playing ""offline"" also disables, for reasons beyond me, a host of options that would increase replay value of individual missions, e.g. different starting points, challenges, and more. Honestly, even without having gotten to the point where I’d like to partake in all those replay extras, I found it depressing to have all these unavailable options there to taunt me. Click on something and you’re immediately challenged to enable the online mode and everything that comes with it. It’s simply depressing to see your game with a bunch of disabled features, regardless of whether you’d actually like to use them or not.
Were I an unkind cynic, I'd have to assume this was to [i]make[/i] me accept the tracking and whatnot, and play my precious single-player game online, after all. As it is, I'll add another sarcastic thank you, and go back to earlier Hitman games, which I enjoyed more and was able to play without arbitrary restrictions. At least I now know to skip the successors and won't ever have to worry about ""missing out.""

If you really can't help yourself, I'd recommend getting this game with a steep, steep discount, because even great games aren't worth this price.* This isn't a great game even before considering the pointless ""online"" chicanery.


*Sticklers** may be tempted point out that the price may change. To which I respond, that whatever the price, whatever the currency, and whatever else that currency might buy in that century, it’d still be too much for [i]this[/i] game, at least. Besides, this game was published six years ago, so odds are the prices will not change, after all. Well, ""up"" is always possible.

177,0,0.8477,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I don't know how to feel about this one. On one hand this game struggles to find the right difficulty. Normal can be way too easy. You can just abuse the save button using it almost like an emulators save state until you get what you want and it honestly cheapens the experience. Then play it on professional and it becomes more what the game should be. Just cranked a notch or two up too hard I'll explain why later. In the first mission on the boat to get used to the game with very little help you'll be able to get every challenge. Yet as you progress the challenges get more cryptic where you'll have to aimlessly wander around. They kept the button where you analyze a situation and the stupid melee combat which i think is out dated by pressing the right sequence of buttons every single time. Come on this isn't resident evil 4. Other than that it's essentially hitman blood money which I am a big fan of with some twists it should have had. I will admit it's a step in the right direction compared to trying to make the game a cheap action movie feeling game where if you took 47 and a few small elements out it could be a different game or movie. 

The good I can say is that the levels look great but there are times the challenges are so stupid you'll be forced to go on youtube to solve certain stuff such as getting the Silvo ~~ to sit in the jet to getting the fashion designer ""soto"" to drink the wine. I feel going on youtube or googling stuff is like having endings spoiled for you of movies or a television series. The intel portion i don't bother with for more than just events. It honestly feels like the game is aware of how tedious it's become. You still get the signature people walking around like they have mental issues to and from the same place and some it feels like they only will do the events when you are around them. On normal the detection is fare. However you can really abuse it by running away from people which in the earlier games such as Contracts this is an even bigger red flag. 

the shooting mechanics are hit and miss. Miss which is a bad pun because my logitech controller I can never get right and rely on the mouse to do the sniping which yes I've tried adjusting the sensitivity of my controller. If I can get 35 head shots in a row in metal gear solid 5 and hit just about anything in GTA 5 it's not the controllers fault. The machine guns feel solid, as do the pistols. However gun fights can be a bit lazy as Agent 47 auto locks onto any target within close enough proximity taking some of the skill away. I know this game is more stealth than anything but getting into bigger gun fights in this game isn't as rewarding. With or without matrix like shooting from hitman absolution as I didn't really care for that. They got rid of the syringes for the most part until you're really late into the game. There is no weapon customize such as in Hitman Blood Money. Where you can choose what is right for the situation. 

There's only 8-ish levels not including DLC or the time wasting escelations. Usually it's two targets in these gigantic stages. The locations are just as diverse as ever. As are the character models. There are parts of the city that really come to life such as people being glued to their cellphones. There is plenty of objects to pick up and the NPCs are more talkative. I found some challenges required zero skill and are way too obvious then you get others such as spooking the man in the first level in Italy are way too cryptic and annoying. The levels are larger but they feel like PS1 games how they just wanted larger cities with very little buildings to go in. I'd add some more red herrings too to throw the people off. Another concern is the NPCs stay knocked out forever. I know it's a video game but that's not realistic. In the older games you'd eventually be woken up so why not these. I found at times it can be too easy to knock them out too such as with throwable objects. One thing I'm glad is that if the enemy sees your face and then you choke them you can still get away with it. 

What didn't I like about this? Professional mode! The cameras should have reacted the way they do in normal as they do on professional mode. When playing on normal at best you get a decreased amount of points where if you're trying to get every challenge after a while you just stop caring. A lot of the escelations are absolutely pointless. Some do give you a gun or two but it feels like Donky Kong 64 how many pointless challenges you do. To do all 100+ of for example the first real level in Paris will take you all day to get every challenge. THEN you have to do some of them on professional. The same exact challenges yet someone who had a bad day hid some items like needles in a haystack. I remember one time I was after a crowbar and i swear there's only one in the entire level. Or rat poison only to find out an NPC was holding it. Sure there is some fun problem solving aspects of it but then they get too silly or exact.  The game tries to reward you with unlockables by beating certain missions or challenges a certain way. Why not just give 47 money the way they did in blood money. What was wrong with that. I'm surprised the W2000 smiper rifle is not in this either.

- The menus are very confusing for new players. I had to use google to figure things out. This shouldn't ever be necessary.
- Voice acting doesn't feel immersive. They have a lot of different voice lines, but.. No matter if you're in Paris, Morocco or Japan, almost everyone has an English accent. Yes, having people speak English with different accents in non-English speaking countries wouldn't be peak immersion either, but this game makes me feel like I'm in England in every map.

At this point I would recommend to buy the trilogy edition here on Steam as this version of the game uses the latest iteration of the Glacier engine AND includes all missions from this game and the second as well. What it does NOT include for some reason are the bonus content missions that you will have to buy separately. Again, if you bought this game and it's extras, simply to get access to them in the v3 of the game.

Hitman 3 is incredibly more optimized than this version, especially if you have a 3xxx series nVidia graphics card as it supports DLSS. If you haven't played any of the last three Hitman games, go for the third one or the Trilogy edition.

I do not quite understand IOI's marketing here but the idea WAS that there would be ONE platform, expanded on over time.
Not three different platforms. As each iteration is limited to it's seasons and releases while the latest contains everything more or less, or at least grants you access to all content from this one and two.

I cannot in good faith recommend buying this version in 2022.

It is a strange experience that I’ve had with the Hitman games. Maybe not as strange as much as it speaks to the strengths of the series.

Before playing this game, the only ones I’ve experienced were [i]Absolution[/i], back when it launched in 2012, and [i]Codename 47[/i], when I tried to get into the series back in 2018, but gave up due to how broken it was. With that, and I guess word of mouth, I can conclude that [i]Hitman[/i] is the most Hitman game I’ve played… but I kind of hate it. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence, and [i]Hitman[/i] sure is a competently made title.

There are just so many things I dislike that this game stands for: the fact that it’s pointlessly a soft reboot, the awful naming convention it plays into, that it feels so on-rails despite touting player choice as its premier quality, that it is (or was) an obnoxious live service, its awfully-sleek main menu that takes you out of the game any chance it gets, its “realistic” yet bland graphics, its “mature” story, the way IO Interactive continues to advertise and sell it… I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.

As such, this review will almost entirely focus on the reasons why you [b]shouldn’t[/b] play [i]Hitman[/i] as a standalone title. Instead, get [i]Hitman 2[/i], pick up the [i]GOTY Legacy Pack[/i] which goes on sale for as low as 3,99€ (cheaper than buying it standalone) and allows you to play the entirety of this game within [i]Hitman 2[/i], including the QoL and gameplay changes that came with it.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2732233751

I hate this stupid naming convention where games just re-use titles of previous entries within the same series, despite not being reboots or remakes. [i]Doom[/i], [i]God of War[/i], [i]Hitman[/i]… I get it, it’s a new beginning for the franchise. While it is true that the very first Hitman game wasn’t simply called [i]Hitman[/i], I’m left wondering why this one wasn't just named [i]Hitman: World of Assassination[/i], as this is how IOI refers to the trilogy it’s a part of. Definitely would have saved them the awkwardness of naming the sequel [i]Hitman 2[/i] when [i]Hitman 2: Silent Assassin[/i] already exists. 

As such, this game gets rid of some of the elements that I’ve really liked in past Hitman games, mainly how cheesy they were at times. The series always had this grindhouse, B-movie feel to it – even as early as [i]Codename 47[/i]. [i]Hitman[/i] has none of that, going instead for a more serious, everyday spy-thriller story, dealing with betrayal and NWOs. I can’t quite tell what it deals with aside from that, as this is only the first chapter of a trilogy. However, this isn’t one story as a part of that trilogy, but rather the first third of a single story. By the end of the 6th, and final, mission, you won’t be feeling particularly satisfied. It doesn’t resolve anything, but rather concludes the set-up for a story that’s supposed to resolve throughout the following two games. There’s no clear villain, no characters, just names in a script that fulfill a purpose.

I know [i]Absolution[/i] was pretty much universally disliked by the fanbase and that its story was ridiculous, even by Hitman standards. But it was memorable! It had flair! And nearly all of the plot points left unresolved in that game are completely dropped. The most mention the old games get is a montage of 47’s past kills in a cutscene after the tutorial, just to confirm that they still happened. That’s all they’re there for. Later on, in a weirdly meta moment, a character all but confirms how irrelevant they are. I realize Hitman isn’t this story-heavy series where continuity is of the utmost importance, but there’s no chance in hell that I can imagine [i]Hitman[/i] as taking place within the same universe as the previous titles. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2732251523

Let’s talk about immersion, and how [i]Hitman[/i] does nothing to immerse its player. Every menu you open in the game has this sterile look to it. Even in the middle of the game, for something as simple as opening your inventory, your eyes are blasted with blinding-white light. I get what they’re trying to do. They’re trying to nail this fantasy of an agent preparing for his assignments, having everything cleanly organized and ready to be reviewed before he embarks on his next mission - but it’s so boring. It feels like the game comes to a screeching halt every time you open a menu. 

It actually gets worse. I’d consider [i]Hitman[/i] to be an impressive-looking game, but the level of animation for the numerous crowds in the game is so lackluster that it creates this uncanny valley effect, where you’re constantly taken out of the experience. It doesn’t help that voice actors across all locations, no matter where in the world your current mission is taking place, speak exactly the same. In previous Hitman games, NPCs would either have an accent or speak in a location-appropriate language. I feel like I’m walking around a theatre stage, with the same actors just changing their costumes and the scenery during loading screens. I’m not being sold on the experience at all. There’s no atmosphere to speak of either, no tension. This is the least immersive Hitman game out of all of them. Undoubtedly so, because I [b]know[/b] [i]Hitman 2[/i] doesn’t have the same problem.

The difficulty is partly to blame. Where in previous Hitman games you were pretty much on your own, aside from the briefing you’d get before a mission, here every time you discover something a message pops up to let you know, and you can then opt to follow a marker that helps you follow through on the information you’ve acquired. These can be turned off or customized with a slew of other settings, but there are no preset difficulty options that offer a curated experience. You’d have to play the game for a bit to know which you’d like to turn off or keep on. You also have unlimited saves this time around when in previous Hitman games all difficulties would have some sort of limitation. Still, there’s no quicksave button, so you’ll have to open that terrible-looking menu every time you wish to save. Similarly, 47 now regenerates health passively and can take like six mags from an SMG before going down, when in previous titles health was a finite resource.
 
There is one exception: Professional difficulty. Here, combat is punishing again and all those hints and markers are off by default. Two things hold it back, however: that it has to be unlocked for each level [b]separately[/b] and that its other restrictions, like the save limit now being [b]one[/b], pretty much require you to possess full knowledge of the levels already, which constitutes playing through them on the boring difficulty several times. There’s no middle ground – which is another thing solved in [i]Hitman 2[/i].  

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2733010673

[h2]Verdict[/h2]

It’s a good thing that IO Interactive continues to improve on its Hitman formula, but the way this evolution was handled, with how integral this game is to the trilogy as a whole, is disappointing. [i]Hitman[/i] is just not worth the time nor money as a standalone title. Get either of the sequels with the appropriate legacy pack if you wish to play it, which you should if you’re at all interested in the trilogy.  

On its own, [i]Hitman[/i] is a remarkable achievement in stealth-sandbox game design, that you shouldn’t care for.

202,0,0.7885,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Game's alright but way too short. I get a lot of people try to argue that the meat of the game is in the variety of ways to complete a mission and the custom contracts but I'm not accepting that. The game is 5 hours long at the pace I played and that's with me replaying a few missions to try out different paths. That's way too short for 20 bucks, also this was what 50 bucks American at launch? Games that are extremely narrative based can get away with that but not something like this where the gameplay is key.

As for the custom contracts, you can only break a guy's neck so many different times before it gets old. Changing the map around isn't enough by itself to make the missions feel distinct. 

Also why does everyone sound the same? I'm in the middle of Paris and everyone has either a North American or British accent as they speak perfect English. It's hard for me to feel like I'm on a globe trotting adventure when the local Parisians can't speak French. It's like that on every mission.

The gameplay is a bit wonky. I've lured guys 100 meters with these coins only to be spotted by some guy half way across the map. I've also had several moments where I'll choke a guy out and someone two rooms over hears it. This kinda thing is rare but it happens enough. 

Outside of combat People dont really react to you either, like I've just blatantly followed people before and they never even bat an eye. No one notices the giant white bald guy that keeps changing outfits as well. It becomes laughable when you start posing as Moroccan military or Japanese security guards, like come on man 47 is pretty distinct. The game definitely needed a way for the AI to react to suspicious behavior or something. I don't feel like a badass hitman when I walk by the same guard 3 times wearing completely different outfits every time and his only reaction is ""nice outfit"". 

If you can pick it up for 10 bucks or less, sure give it a go but not at 20."

While I would still recommend this game - I would not recommend buying this game... 

All of the content is available in HITMAN2 and HITMAN3 as DLCs.  !!!

Those DLCs are available when you purchase the older games or when you directly purchase the DLCs for the newer game.

My suggestion would be if you have not purchased Hitman1 or Hitman2 that you buy Hitman3 and the two DLCs that contain the Hitman1 and Hitman2 content.

======================================================================

Differences in the content on Hitman1 game and the Hitman2 Legacy DLC

The differences are minimal and really only have to do with game play changes between the two games - such as briefcase sniper rifles and ""cover"" in grass/crowds etc... Master skill level as well

There are a few differences in the in game challenges - but note if you want to complete all of the in game challenges and get all of the Steam achievements for Hitman 2 you will have to play all of the Hitman 1 content within Hitman 2...

======================================================================

Original review before loading Hitman 2

Have played all Hitman games from ""code name 47"" through  this one... was originally worried about how much game play this really would provide per mission - but with the challenges and such this game provides more game play than all the previous games combined. The game can be as challenging as you want to make it.  I completed all of the challenges on normal mode and didn't play ""Professional"" at all - still spent over 300 hours playing the game.

The one thing you won't be able to do purchasing this game now are the ""Elusive Targets"" - I'm sure those were fun and would have added to the game - but honestly since I didn't get to try them I can't say I missed playing them as 300 hours was plenty of game time for me.

Jarago:

""Idea of the game is great, silent assassin ordered to kill some targets. It's cool concept and i really wanted to like this. Unfortunately the way this game works is through trial and error, save & reload pattern. Everything is about exploring every room, every important guest, being patient and tactical... except its just an illusion.

I personally cannot proceed through the missions with the sense of accomplishment or satisfaction simply because the only way to actually accomplish the mission in stealth is by learning patterns of guards and wintesses, learning exactly where target is going go to, what glass they're going to drink from and so on. By the time you learn that, targets already script-walked through all the places where assassination could take place and only thing you can do is reload back to mission start and prepare your assassination based on the knowledge from previous exploring... As if Hitman was supposed to be psychic, able to see into the future of what the target is going to be doing next or where it's going to stand during the next 5 seconds.

For me, this kind of observe & reload based gameplay simply does not give me the feeling of accomplishment i would expect from a game like this, because i basically just saved & reloaded bunch of times until something worked.""

In other words, boring.

Kwisatz Quakerach:

""I've been playing Hitman games since 2002, with the release of 'Silent Assassin' and I have played through and beaten them all. Any game with a rating system for your missions, I would strive for dozens of hours to get the perfect and fastest Silent Assassin run one could get. This franchise stumbled heavily with Absolution, and cracked its skull on the pavement with this reboot.""
""...I feel it is just so over-developed in the levels and frankly boring.""
""...bloated/artificial grind for particular play-styles..""
""...over-utilization of achievements locking gear/outfits instead of simply completing the level with a good rating stifles the flow of the game. I replayed Hitman 1, 2, Contracts, and Bloodmoney over and over again because it was immensely fun to do so, and to discover what the developers intended and did not intend in the levels. I feel, because of the reasons listed, this sense of discovery is now entirely artificial and fake. It's as if they built a strategy guide into the game.""

In other words, soul-less and boring. Forget the DRM and episodic release ( I bought the game on sale years after release for what I believe was pretty cheap) and I just got bored. And I've played every hitman game (besides absolution) 10x over.

It isn't satisfying like the other games. I was just... bored. It's 20 minutes walking around trying to figure out what to do or how to gain access to that, followed by another reload, by another reload. And then 10 more times. It's fucking boring. 

It's frustrating because once again the hitman franchise for me still isn't what it was. It's nice to know I'm not the only one who feels that way. It's a shame that it doesn't seem like this new format isn't going anywhere."

But somehow, Hitman 2 does work, but it doesn't make any sense to play the later games if you haven't played the first one yet. Will refund all titles of this franchise including the second game and Absolution after a day if the issue isn't resolved.

Edit 1: Somehow the game works now. Don't know why or how but it seems that there is a trend of buying a product that doesn't seem to work as intended initially, but after a night sleep it miraculously works like nothing happened. I believe the issue was the game not being able to communicate in order to register on their servers properly. With a brand new machine, most updated drivers and windows 10, I truly find it hard to believe it's that and not on the product's end since all other games (Aside from another one that seemed to have the same exact issue, and fixed just like this one) works flawlessly as intended.

This game depends entirely on replay value, as opposed to story/level progression like its predecessors, by offering many ways to assassinate your targets and additional challenges along the way. I like this concept, but a huge flaw is how these challenges get ticked off as soon as they're completed. This means stealth, discretion, and strategy no longer matters, just jump in and do the challenge. If you die in the process, doesn't matter, it still gets ticked off.

This also means you can simply load a saved file, complete the challenge, reload the save file, and repeat until all the challenges are completed. I find this very tedious.

These two issues could be resolved by ticking off challenges only once the level is complete. I'd also like score reductions applied to knocking out people, the number of times you change outfit, and NPCs suspicion.

Asides from the graphics and improved AI, this whole game feels like a downgrade, non of your actions effect the later levels so you can be as rambunctious as you like. And once you reach level 20 on a location, there's no reason to keep playing other than self satisfaction.

The graphics are amazing but so are all the new AAA titles, it's not a big deal nowadays to have lifelike visuals.

Overall, I love the direction Hitman is going, but it's feeling more like a downgrade. It's definitely worth buying on discount."

Essentially it is more like a free trial that isn't free and then requires you to keep paying in order to actually play the game. So it can get really expensive. These types of games should be boycotted, unless of course you want game developers to continue ripping people off with micro-transactions.

They give you only one map with the game and force you to pay a high price for each individual map (DLC). Each map can be completed in about an hour. A person can string out that time by playing the same map over and over and over again.

In the end they will drain your wallet for way more then any normal game would cost.

Better off saving your money for an actual game, not just a single map where all content is a new transaction.  These devs took the phrase ""micro-transaction"" to a new level of deceit with expensive micro-transactions that are required in order to actually play the game. Otherwise you don't have access to any content besides one single map/stage.  Essentially it is more like a free trial that isn't free.

So many people were hyped for Hitman games back in the early and mid 2000's. I never saw him as a bad-ass character, even though the man was and still is one of the most iconic video game characters to date. In my opinion, the franchise is simply overrated.

The graphics look good, the voice acting is solid, the music is ok, the user interface is obviously designed for consoles, and the gameplay is boring. There are few ways to get to the target, and take it out with limited variety of means. But despite those few choices available, the game lacks in creativity of approach to deal with the targets. While I was playing, I wanted to do the things my own way, the way I saw it possible to do, depending on the situation, but the player will always be locked behind limited resources, which are being used as tools, and fixed game mechanics. The freedom of approach to deal with the assassinations is only an illusion. You always have to play by the rules, imposed by the game mechanics. Period. And that makes bad, stale and boring gameplay.

Not recommended."
280,0,0.5631,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Having played past Hitman games and generally liking them, I was interested to try this very well received entry to the series. It's certainly a well-presented game. With great graphics and interesting locations. Yet no matter how much I wanted to like it, it simply wouldn't click. It was frustrating. Individually, the game possesses great elements, for the longest time I couldn't figure out what was wrong. I now believe it was due to a rather subtle, but fundamental and unfortunate design choice. How missions play.

The game only has a handful of missions, but the maps are sprawling and you are meant to replay them several times. Likely a result of the game's episodic release scheme. Initial runs are meant to be purely exploration ones, there can't be a perfect kill in an early run. You just lack the information necessary. Therefore, you are to observe your targets, often clumsily, find patterns and jot down schedules, all the while missing those opportunities and having to accept you simply won't do well this time. 

This damages my immersion, as it diminishes 47's allure as the ultimate killer. Not much of an ultimate killer if you have no concrete plans going into a mission, or when unable to seize opportunities as they appear, without prior knowledge and extensive save-scumming. Prior knowledge you can only gain by doing the mission before and ""time-travelling"" back. Perhaps more importantly, this also makes those initial runs grueling and tiring affairs. The game's otherwise impressive oversized maps, end up aggravating this problem further.

I don't really consider Hitman to be a bad game. I disagree with an important design choice, I believe it is detrimental to the game and in my case at least made me drop it. I think the game would have benefitted a great deal from a proper intel system before a mission, as well as more numerous and concentrated maps. This would probably allow for some more story too. I suppose it's a matter of preference and if Steam had neutral as a possible rating, I'd mark this as a neutral. As it stands, not recommended it is."

You are forced to find the select paths and timings to do your job, no creative freedom in any of it.

Every map is pretty much the same principle; 
-tons of people, no chance of hiding, immediately getting spotted;
-Ai is quite janky, spotting you through walls at times;
-getting punished for killing off non-targets, which is annoying since there barely is any way to circumvent enemies, subtracting 5000 points per off-target kill. So even if you pull everything else off perfectly, you still get a bad score for killing off trash;
-disguises work on half of the enemies, making them obsolete;
-every opportunity is basically a timed event, and time is scarce. Making you finish the same map again to have somewhat ""replay value"", yet it doesn't feel like it;
-save scumming is more a necessity than in X-com, which is just ridiculous;

 I personally cannot proceed through the missions with the sense of accomplishment or satisfaction simply because the only way to actually accomplish the mission in stealth is by learning patterns of guards and wintesses, learning exactly where target is going go to, what glass they're going to drink from and so on. By the time you learn that, targets already script-walked through all the places where assassination could take place and only thing you can do is reload back to mission start and prepare your assassination based on the knowledge from previous exploring... As if Hitman was supposed to be psychic, able to see into the future of what the target is going to be doing next or where it's going to stand during the next 5 seconds.

For me, this kind of observe & reload based gameplay simply does not give me the feeling of accomplishment i would expect from a game like this, because i basically just saved & reloaded bunch of times until something worked. I understand the appeal for those who like it tho, replayability and searching for many different ways to complete the mission can be lots of fun -> This is just a note for potential new players about what to expect out of this game."

While improved in complexity since Absolution, game still retains a lot of simplification including the ""Instinct"" meter from that game.
Furthermore, game severely lacks in content, having only 7 levels (including tutorial).
And the biggest reason behind why I cannot in good faith recommend it, is that there's content that was time-gated behind always-online DRM layer that the game has and is no longer available, permanently removed from the game - the content in question is known as ""Elusive Targets"" which are unique scripted missions with unique targets that you could undertake only once at specific date given by developer and have all since been removed from the game permanently.
In other words, if you buy the game now you get A LOT less content (there were around 20 such missions that are now removed) and are treated as second rate customer.
This is even worse if you actually bought the game earlier when the system was still present, as you effectively now have less of a game than you originally paid for as they removed all the content permanently for everyone, including people that had experienced it when it was available.
Given this and the fact that there are unique gadgets and outfits locked behind that system that are now also permanently unobtainable, all I can say is that the game should be avoided by everyone with even a tiny bit of self respect."

But then, the (purposefully) confusing DLC, the always online DRM, the episodic slow-drip content, the timed missable events, and then the news that Hitman 3 is a timed exclusive for Epic Games tells me that IO Interactive has gotten a taste for the money and they are going to be milking it for all it's worth. It is not going to get better, only worse. It's in line with the money-hungry trend of artifically birthed ""sequels"", where it is just a movie stretched to be 3 titles long when it could just as well fit into a single film... You may think we don't realize, but we do.

Years upon years of crafting and perfecting the series, to die and to come back from the dead to give us the most solid Hitman- experience to date, only upon it's triumphant return to be greeted with this... warped games-as-a-service travesty is utterly heartbreaking.

I love Hitman, but I cannot support these aggressive practices. It is the sole reason I am not going to be spending money for an otherwise perfect game, or any games from IOI after, and I will inform and warn my friends and relatives not to buy such games that embrace these predatory practices.

I cannot in good faith recommend this game.

The tl;dr is Hitman (2016) is a really great game on the whole, having bought it 3 years after the Linux release, however IO Interactive prove that they care more about money than their customers, to the detriment of their products, and I'd recommend you don't support the practice.

The Good is that Hitman is a break from blood money, sure, but a substantial improvement over Absolution, I'd probably say I enjoyed this even more than blood money.
Generally, the game-play is superb and the level design is great. The graphics are delicious and the PC version of the game is a masterpiece of software design, with great graphics options and support for Dualshock and Xbox controllers, or mouse and keyboard if you prefer with on-the-fly switching. (I actually swap to mouse if I have to shoot)
The feral (linux) version of Hitman (which I played) is fantastic, the launcher is optional but very helpful, gamemode is built in and of only two crashes I've seen in nearly 20 hours, the game produces very helpful error messages.
The music is great but a bit forgettable, the voice acting is usually good but there are a few issues I'll get to later.
The animations are top notch and attention to detail in this game across the board is super.

Now the bad... i'll split into two here, game-play and philosophical.

Game-play wise the problem is this game only has 6 locations to play (and this game is [i]short[/i]), with a heavy reliance on making the player play through each mission many [i]many[/i] times to get each challenge, feat or achievement which in itself only serves to unlock more options to play that same location or flex on the scoreboards (which afaik are filled with cheaters anyway). By comparison blood money had 13 levels.

These 6 levels can be subject to player made contracts, in a move borrowed from valve, why make content when your customers will do it for you?
Escalation contracts are another game type (still on these same 6 locations), these involve starting simply, such as assassinating a gardener or guard with a short patrol pattern and the mission gets harder each time you try it. This sounds fun at first but you try having to kill 5 gardeners within 30 seconds of each other without being seen having done the mission 4 times already... it gets tedious. Whats the reward? Bragging rights mostly. 

The game is quite hand-holdy and you can only unlock higher difficulty after you already clear a mission, on a level-by-level basis, by which time you've already gained way too much intel on the level. 
The game has an opportunity and intel system in which Diana butts in constantly to tell you how nice it might be to micro-manage you to a win. Most of these you can track from the get-go and handy-dandy waypoints play the game for you. Of course you can ignore these and the most efficient way to play the game thereafter usually tends to be much less interesting if you intend to finish without bodies found since most opportunities involve accidents. A found body is instantly one less star and 20k less score. (You are never actually required to kill anyone by accident or in a certain disguise in story)

The voice acting. The actor for 47 (David Bateson) does a phenomenal job. The voice acting and character design for Diana in this game drives me insane however. As an English guy nothing insults me more than a poor English accent and Diana has it in spades. Along with the animation and visual design of Diana in game, (which is shit) the actress also manages to make Diana seem out of her depth and scared like a posh little girl clutching her purse at the very thought of a brutish man getting too near, where she should instead be cunning and manipulative, unafraid.
If you want an accent from a particular location, [i]hire a voice actor local to that location![/i]
The NPCs in this game, regardless of location have either a US or English accent. This is pretty jarring when you are in Morocco or France or Italy and the guards sounds like he was recently pulled from a pub in Camden.
They all very helpfully speak English, too!

The story is very weak on the ground here, 47 seems to be the personal puppet of Diana here, where he gets paid to do whatever, because the ICA feel like it apparently. Tangentially, 47 gets paid (since that's all he cares about) but you never actually see any money in the game, which doesn't work out badly, but might better incentivise players to perform better than just a score screen.
I found myself very very disinterested in the story which serves as nothing more than an apéritif for the next two games to come.

Which brings me on to the philosophical problems with this game, where IO interactive, much like 47, value money over all else.

Instead of crafting a complete and interesting story they continue to string you along with drips and drops of world-building where nothing happens, IO interactive had the balls to instead of selling us a complete game sold the game in parts making it confusing to purchase, especially since all the content available in this game is available in Hitman 2. (Though I've heard this was on part of SquareEnix pressuring them)
To better incentivise players to buy the game at full price as they were released, elusive target contracts were dropped as challenges for players. Insultingly there is currently no way to play these contracts any more, stealing this content away from current players.

The big problem for me, the [b]biggest[/b] issue with this game is the always online requirements and the telemetry privacy invasion. [b]If you read no other part of this review read hereafter.[/b]

These days, if you are playing games you are being tracked. That's the long and short of it. Whether it's indies or AAA games they want to know how, what, why you are playing so they can better manufacture and market a new product you'll part your cash for.

It gets worse. In order to play 90% (and that's not really an exaggeration) of the game you paid for you [b]MUST[/b] be online. If you somehow lose internet connection, online saves are not compatible with offline saves. Challenges and therefore mastery and score are also unavailable. You will get a large pop-up and be taken back to the main menu where you'll see a very much stripped down game.
This is the same experience you'll have if you decline the privacy policy.
IO interactive will tell you that this is because they wanted Hitman to be a shared experience where players connect and compete, or that it is required for functionality.
The jaded cynic in me says they did this first and foremost for telemetry data and as anti-piracy measures.
And now we've seen that Hitman 3 is going to be an Epic Game Store exclusive, Tim's flash of cash really caught some eyes.
Hitman 2 doesn't have Linux support either.

Of course none of these problems are the fault of Feral Interactive, which published the Linux build, it's just unfortunate.

I had fun with this game, I knew what I was getting into when I paid for it, but I don't think I'll buy another IO Interactive product soon.

You could don any disguise, kill targets whenever/however you wanted, there were so many paths to winning you could spend days on a single mission, and there were always new things to discover. Now it's only 'improvisational' as far as the developers see fit to give you a few specific paths to victory (which they will heavily incentivize). The path to the highest points it to play the mission over and over again, failing each time, until you figure out exactly where they want you to go and how they want you to do things. You're following a script. True, the script has more than one path, but you get punished for deviating. Not to mention the terrible control scheme, which was an obvious copy/past job from the console release... with a port like this, I see no point to playing a PC. You can buy an X-Box for far cheaper than what a comparative PC costs to make the game look equally good, and you'll have a more intuitive controller to boot.

My main gripe with the game is that there is very little content to play around with, only 6 locations, while pretty to look at and fairly large in scope, are greatly limited by piss poor design decisions that limit what you can actually make happen.

And then there's the AI, which is so deeply retarded you can spin around, dance and run laps around it without it reacting to you because all you need is a coin or another item that you can throw and that is all you need to break the game, because the idiotic AI will, without fail, always go investigate a noise meaning you can lure guards, random npcs, even targets that pass by into bathroom, closets, whathaveyou and make missions an utter joke because the stupid sheep willingly walk into the slaughter without complaint.

That said, first time running through a level is fairly enjoyable, observing the limited, repeating routines of the AI targets, guards and other npcs to try to figure out a best approach to get to them (at least till you realize you can just walk into a room with pair of scissors for an example and throw those on the floor to lure everyone near by to come to you), the story ends before it really even starts (need to buy Hitman 2 to continue it!) and.. that's about the positives for the game.

The potential was there, but it was sadly sacrificed at the altar of piece meal delivery and combined with the fact story barely goes anywhere before it ends i hesitate to recommend this game to anyone so if you looking for a stealthy puzzle 'shooter', look elsewhere or wait for a very DEEP sale as anything beyond few bucks/euros is a waste of money."

Despite enjoying Hitman 2, I cannot support this predatory business practice of PC exclusivity, nor the recent actions taken by Epic on the Apple and Google Play stores. I've seen a backlash against consumers using ""review bombing"" tactics, but what other choice do consumers have? Consumers have no real avenues to be heard in an organized and effective way, and the unfortunate reality of review bombing is that it works, even if the product in this case doesn't ""deserve"" it -- what other option is there that would be both visible and impactful?

Imagine if consoles had all of these separate stores that we see on PC, and companies competed with exclusivity not just between different consoles, but within each console ecosystem. Consoles are already closed systems, but it would practically require collusion, if not legal regulation, to accomplish, both of which are objectionable propositions. Would console gamers stand for that? It would certainly degrade the spirit of console as a platform, which is to streamline gaming accessibility.

Conversely, the spirit of PC is about choice in a more ""open"" ecosystem, so while you could argue that exclusivity deals are ""natural"" to an open market, it defeats the imperative of choice by holding products hostage. Consequently, an open market should allow consumers to push back and refuse products or practices they do not want, and thus the market should adjust. However, the avenues by which consumers can express this perspective are limited, and only further narrowing; also, not all consumers are savvy or interested enough to follow the business behind the products they may want, nor understand why certain practices may conflict with their best interests. So, we're left with somewhat of a minority of enthusiasts that do understand the repercussions, with few options to rebuff, thus the need for amplification to inform the unaware.

Exclusivity is not only anti-consumer, but anti-PC. Do not allow companies to continue to dictate your choices via brute-force business practices."

Was it the free Demo that was sold seperately? Sixty dollars and you get so little but it is a good thing it has replayability. It has an old school feel with each level as NPCs run on a script and you can learn routes and item locations without the game throwing a curve at you. Most of the money appears to be spent on visuals and sounds and the eyes and ears do not go wanting but I might as well watch the movie if that is the focus. 

Now I will talk about the story itself. A throw away line at the end suggests that this game takes place over twenty years from the tutorial to the end (which is otherwise never hinted at and might throw a new player for a loop). The story itself was pretty good; you had a great villain that was slowly built up over the course of each mission with evil organizations on the side. You want to fight this guy. He sounds intelligent, crafty, cultured and, most important, feels like the Hitman's equal. Then the game flops at the end and has you killing some washed up has been that you wouldn't remember from the tutorial if the game was any longer. ""Surprise!"" your villain is in another game. 

Hitman 2 seems to follow this game as a DLC game. This game might be worth the money in another 200 hours but I am not sure I can keep my attention on it.

I played a ton of Silent Assassin and a lot of Contracts too but was disappointed by their departure from the original game engine, which had a kind of simulation feel to it. 

I think what also made the first game so good was the tight level design and the fact that each mission really did feel quite distinct and unique. Also the story was much simpler: you were an assassin; you were given contracts and you carried them out, and that was pretty much it. 

For instance, one level was set around a single small restaurant and really didn't take very long to complete, but it's one of the most memorable, because of how interesting and imaginative and how unique it felt; and for the most part the levels did all feel unique and not just because of the setting...

...it wasn't all good with the original however. There were much  larger, less focused, more diffuse levels that at the time were considered ""the bad levels""; they were known as ""the Rambo levels"" on the forums, because they were set in a jungle, were chaotic and sprawling, covering a very large area and geared more to accommodate gun play.

Fast forward 16 years to Hitman (2016) and we have more, even bigger, more sprawling, more chaotic levels packed it seems with as many NPCs as ioi can possibly cram onto the screen at one time; technically impressive...? ...yes, I suppose so, but, to some extent it seems that the levels in the Hitman reboot are now all ""rambo levels"", with the same handful of mechanics repeated time and time again throughout, with the good stuff spread so thin that you can barely find it...

...like they've broken apart the good stuff and bloated out the gaps with repetitive filler and hundreds of random NPCs.

That having been said, I did enjoy the free trial missions of both Hitman (2016) and Hitman 2 (2018), because they were smaller in size, tighter and more focused. Unfortunately the rest of their levels have this massive bloat to them.

I must say that I did enjoy the more fully detailed ""Opportunities"" and would have loved to have played through every single challenge and feat in the game as an ""Opportunity"" if they'd been fully detailed, especially with Diana in my ear talking me through it. That was a really enjoyable part of the game...up to a point; e.g. when you're on a huge, extended, sprawling  map chock full of hundreds of NPCs and you complete the  current Opportunity objective just to find that the next instruction is: ""Find a key."" with no map marker.

...another frustrating example: you find an invitation to the auction in the mission ""The Show Stopper"" and Diana tells you she's set up a fake identity for you to attend the auction but she doesn't tell you who you have to speak to and where you have to go to access the auction.  I used an ""Opportunity"" to brute forced my way to the auction location disguised as a sheikh and played through the auction sequence, but I still couldn't tell you how you're supposed to use the invitation to get there dressed as 47.

...this is, for the most part, due again to the the massive size of the maps and the sheer number of NPC's on the level, all of which, just made me feel like I was lost in a sea of people.  

The Hitman.Fandom.com wiki states that ""the maps in [Hitman (2016)] are 'six to seven times larger than the biggest levels in Absolution.' Levels accommodate about 300 non-playable characters (NPCs), with each having different routines and reacting differently to players' actions."" (https://hitman.fandom.com/wiki/HITMAN_(2016))

...my thoughts on this are that often ""less is more"" and with Hitman I think that's absolutely the case. You can have 47 walking around in a stadium full of people, all -- if you don't manage to avoid bumping into them, which can be very hard to avoid and very tiring  -- reacting slightly differently,  but something just seems to get lost in the chaos; for me, what's getting lost is the premise of the original game, and the overall quality of the series...

...they can make it bigger, wider, longer, taller, flashier and stuff even more NPC's into the ever more bloated levels, but it just means the good stuff is diluted to the point of getting lost. It's ironic and unfortunate that the bigger and flashier it gets, the fewer bellls and whistles it seems to have, and the bells and whistles are what make Hitman what it is.

ioi seem to have found a fan-base and it seems they're continuing to cater to them, but for me it's just not really Hitman in the sense that the original Hitman (2000) is Hitman. Hitman (2016)'s levels are a sprawling mess of chaos where it's practically impossible to find the unique content without the ""Opportunities"" mechanic...

...I think the problem is they're committed to making it a huge ""sandbox"" game where missions in the original Hitman game were smaller individual set pieces.  What we've ended up with is a ton of bloat consisting of extensive repetition of a small handful of common mechanics not diverse enough for sandbox play at this scale, if you're factoring out the gun play. It's all the very definition of filler, especially because the gun play needed to fully justify the bloat, is antithetical to the core premise of playing a slick, efficient, professional assassin.

I recommend the free trial missions (""Freeform Training"", ""The Final Test"" and the escalation missions for ""The Final Test"" mission)  for Hitman (2016); but as for the rest of it I just wish I could get my money back...

...although having said that the ""Opportunity"" mission "" A Case Most Peculiar"" in the ""World of Tomorrow"" stage was really excellent. The ""Opportunity"" titled ""Absolution"" in that stage was good also. Apart from those two I'm not sure because I've not played all of the Opportunities in the game yet. Some are terrible, for instance just giving you a marker to travel to on a second or third floor with no other help or instruction as to what you should be doing or how you should do it. Trying to get to those places on these sprawling maps is just fatiguing. 

Hitman II (2018)'s free downloadable stage ""Night Call"" I also recommend playing, as it's very compact and is closer to how the stages in the very first hitman were designed. I've not bought the rest of Hitman II (2018); I just used the internet to compare the size of the map for ""Night Call"" to the size of the rest of the maps in Hitman II (2018), which again are massive, and decided against purchasing.

If the price of Hitman II (2018) drops further in a sale once Hitman III (202X) is released, then I might buy Hitman II (2018) just to play the ""Opportunity"" portions of the missions, although I got Hitman (2016) in a sale for less than 10 and I still don't think it was worth it.

 I do want to play the ""Opportunity"" portions of the missions however, as stuff like the Opportunity ""A Case Most Peculiar"" does kind of smoulder with a blazing potential.

But later you get to an extremely small area absolutely full of NPC's who can see through your disguise, which is just not fun, as you can't move ten feet without drawing suspicion. What you have to do there seems like it might be really cool but there's not enough instruction from Diana to know what you're supposed to be doing and the abundance of ""enforcers"" just make it a headache inducing chore. 

I just wish I could play every feat and challenge in the game as a fully detailed ""Opportunity"" and with Diana in my ear talking me through it...then it could be something I could really love. 

Give 47 a pair of disguised, augmented reality glasses connected to Diana via an uplink and make all of the feats and challenges Opportunities that she talks you through with augmented reality prompts, images and directions. This could be optional to equip or to not equip, depending on how you want to play. Sell it as a DLC to cover the extra production cost. 

Also, ioi should approach Joanna Lumley to voice Diana. ;0)"

[b]The Episodic format[/b] which I find deeply immersion breaking but more importantly is a bad practice by the company.
[b]The online DRM[/b], simply unacceptable in a purely singleplayer game and hurting performance with frequent stuttering.

[b]DETAILED THOUGHTS:[/b]

[b]The Story[/b] feels really short with only 6 missions, it almost takes a backseat and there there is not much cohesion because of the format and the underwhelming cutscenes that don't explain much of anything to a satisfying degree. The tone is way lighter than what I expected and it felt like the locations where picked just as a gimmick and to make beautiful environments, which are indeed very beautiful though, I would much prefer something more ordinary or not this much wild variety at least. Even though the missions are built to be replayed many many times, it's no excuse for having a short and poor story line and I didn't feel like replaying them at all.

[b]Gameplay[/b] is pretty good. I like the opportunity system a lot even though sometimes they feel like they were just laid right in front of you. I still think the mechanics felt a little old but fine overall. I didn't like the level design much as I felt it didn't give enough room for some approaches.

[b]Optimization[/b] was not as good sadly, I had significant drops sometimes and it was generally incosistent, perhaps courtesy of the DRM as well.

[b]UI[/b] was not well done, the menu navigation is confusing, mission preparation is the same. Other things like hiding the quit button in the options for no reason.

[b]The Elusive Targets[/b] not being all available after the game's life cycle was over is an absolute joke.

I don't recommend this game at any price. Instead consider Hitman 2 Legacy edition which includes all missions from this game but slightly remastered as well and it's overall a far superior game in my opion.

-) Interface has gotten worse. Especially the menu. They added a lot and all those stacked categories, pictures, and sections; It's not easily distinguishable at first. It'll be confusing a bit.
-) When using items, such as keys, lock picks, poisons, etc. a menu will pop up taking control of your gameplay in order to ask you if you want to use it or not. There, you have to press either enter (far away from both of your hands) or click the enter sign. It's cumbersome.

The game is packed with plenty of filler such as waiting for targets to stand in the right spot and long dialogue that you have to listen to if you want to discover different ways to kill a target. I have 8.2 hours in the game and I think maybe 1 hour of that was actual fun. The rest was waiting and having to restart due to the absolutely unpredictable AI that have eyes on the back of their heads.

Not to mention how insultingly short the game is? You play the tutorial twice, then a generous 5 more missions, each mission lasting 20 minutes if you dont have to restart (which you will), and thats it. This does not go well with the cliffhanger the game leaves you on.

One would think with levels that are absolutely massive in size, NPCs everywhere, and at least  6 or 7 different scripted quest chains for taking out targets, there should be limitless options for the player, right? Well, wrong. First of all, note that I use the word scripted. None of those different methods of taking out targets are actually achieved by the player. Rather, the game has various ""opportunities,"" as they call it, whereby it will tell you exactly where to go and what to do there, usually involving standing still and listening to a painfully long and boring conversation (more on this later), before beating up (or killing if you prefer) a civilian and stealing his/her costume. With that costume on, some types of NPCs, those wearing other costumes, will generally let you pass, whereas those of the same costume sometimes recognize you're not one of them. Anyway, these opportunities deprive the player of freedom, because you never actually do any of the steps yourself. There is no fun in playing a game where you blindly repeat what a walkthrough tells you to do.

But, you can turn the opportunities off. Okay, fine, so try that out. However, the levels are so ridiculously massive and any one small mistake will trigger the ai to come and kill you, that the game punishes you for trying out anything. I can't tell you how many times I spent probably 30-40 minutes or over an hour on a single level, executing everything flawlessly, only for one idiot guard to recognize me when he shouldn't have, and now all my time was wasted.

Wasted, because the game won't let you save. On the professional difficulty, you literally have just one save, so that involves a ridiculous amount of blind repetition till you figure out just how to game the system and trick the poorly programmed ai (or of course just read how to do it online, which is what most people do, but again, there's no fun in copying a walkthrough). But even on the lower difficulty, the game won't let you save if you're in combat, which since you're about to die would probably be the one time you want to save the most. There are ""autosaves,"" but the game doesn't autosave after killing a target. You would think achieving the primary objective would grant you a save, but no. However you choose to play, there's no getting around the fact that you'll keep getting frustrated, losing a lot of progress, and having to repeat it all over again till you get just a tiny bit further by figuring out how to abuse the ai.

So, inevitably, I get so sick of putting up with all of this bullshit that I say, fuck it, I'm just going to go and play this like an action game, i.e. guns ablazing, kill 'em all! That doesn't work either, because you have next to no health (and especially on professional one hit kills you), and there's endless waves after waves of guards. Of course, the a.i. are so poorly programmed that you can hide in one spot behind cover and they won't even shoot at you, yet even dropping hundreds upon hundreds of bodies, the game won't save or let you save because you're in ""combat"" mode.

So, to recap, you are punished for exploring and experimenting in this world because any slight mistake will send waves of enemies after you and/or undo a lot of your time and progress up to that point. You are forced to game the system or blindly follow the scripted events the way the game tells you to, or read how to do it online. And you can't even just run in and shoot 'em all, because apart from the tutorial level and the sapienza (Spain) level, that won't work.

Even if you remove your brain and blindly follow the opportunities as told, most of the gameplay involves standing around for minutes on end, either waiting for the a.i. to walk to the right position, or waiting for a lengthy conversation to finish. This is intolerably bad because there's about 3 or 4 voice actors in the entire game, and the only way I can adequately describe their voices is they sound bitchy. That uptight, holier-than-thou, upper class sound. The kind of people who whine about the first world of first world problems. And no matter where you are in the world--Japan, Thailand, France, the Middle East, etc.--they will always speak in the same American and British accents. This is massively immersion breaking. Hell, even in the level set in America, they don't sound like who they're supposed to be (terrorists). The voice acting, and the dialogue the actors recite, is simply horrendous, and you can't play the game well until you've heard every piece of dialogue so many times that you know what they'll say before they say it. 

Speaking of immersion breaking, none of the ""characters"" behave like real people. They are like a roller coaster on rails. They are programmed to walk from point A, to point B, and perhaps to point C. Rinse and repeat. Many times you will listen to a conversation, and not only will the dialog repeat after finishing, which is understandable in a game, but the action of the NPC itself will repeat, where he finishes talking and gets up, only to sit right back down and say the same line again. The head administrator of a hospital is never in his office, where you'd think he'd be working, because he's only programmed to walk into the garden and restaurant. If a target's point C is to sit down at a table,  no other NPC will occupy that table once he leaves, because your target is programmed to come back there, and that's not possible if somebody else has taken his seat. This is part of the reason I say ""playing the game"" is just gaming the system or abusing the a.i. mechanics. You have to memorize where each NPC will be (because it's exactly the same every playthrough), by endless repetition, and try to trick the a.i.. I don't feel like I'm some badass killer evading enemies' notice; even when I do succeed it's only by abusing just how broken the a.i. are.

The enemy guards in this game are like the enemies in the first (and by far worst) Assassin's Creed game. If you accidentally bump into them while walking, they want to kill you. If you so much as look at them the wrong way, they'll come at you. There is little predictability to what you must to do in order to trigger the enemies' coming after you. Anything and everything you do leads to being chased by guards (and sooner or later failing the mission), which is why I said the game punishes exploration and experimentation.

Believe it or not, the ""opportunities"" (in-game walkthroughs) are not the only form of cheating the game encourages. Batman Arkham games have detective mode. Assassin's Creed has eagle eye vision. Hitman has a similar mode called ""Instinct,"" which lets you see through walls. This is so broken that I actually completed the Colorado mission just by sniping all my targets from across the map, often when they were obscured behind objects. Realistically, no one can look through walls, and you're just an ordinary human, so this feels like cheating. The game also tells you which NPC's can recognize you through the disguise, and their location appears on map, as does the target. Again, this feels like cheating because realistically, how would Hitman know magically where the enemy is at all times? Or if there's a guard behind a wall I've never gone past before? Other games usually show maps for areas you've been to, not before you've been there, or if they do, it won't tell you where enemies are. But like other cheats, the game wasn't intended to be played with them turned off, so doing so will only make your experience more of a living hell.

Finally, the maps are way too large. This may seem good as there's only 6 in the entire game, each of which are intended to be repeated numerous times, but it's not. It just means that each map takes hours (not hyperbole) to finish, you miss out on most of the level's content each time (you can only kill a man once even if there's 10 different ways), and there's many more ways to fail"

Cons: Pretends to be open world sandbox by combining rigid, linear level design with ""waiting simulator 2016"", consistently buggy AI, frames plummet during gunfights, and deliberate sections of the game deigned to limit creative play in favor of forcing the player down rigid routes. They actively and deliberately prevent the game's main selling points in favor of artificial difficulty in the form of forced waiting and scripted AI designed to limit mechanics without broadcasting it ahead of time; forcing the player to start over constantly to give the illusion of difficulty.

This should've been a good experience but the engine, level design, and route progression were haphazardly tossed into what might be the best world building and mechanics the industry has ever seen. The developers responsible for the cons seem content to lay out great concepts without following through. Not worth full price for most and not worth any amount of money.

TLDR: Get it when it's 80% off or it's not worth it. There is not enough content for the money unless you like replaying the same 6 maps over and over.

Technical/Bugs
- Firstly, I could not get more than 30fps. Low GPU utilisation is a known issue that's never been fixed. Being stuck on 20-30 fps affected my aim a lot when I was in combat, but I mostly sneak around, so I put up with it.
- Always online DRM/Software as a service. (personally doesn't bother me, but does bother others)
- Encountered some bugs when trying to kill targets with certain 'accidents' had to take them out in other ways.

Content
- There are 8 levels, if you exclude the training levels, there are only 6. The least of any Hitman game. With that said, the levels are big with many ways to take out your targets. The idea here is for you to replay the levels killing both the same or different targets.
- Personally I think an extra couple of levels were needed, if you are playing for the story it feels like you only get the first quarter of one before they ask you to buy Hitman 2 for the rest.
- Plenty of ways to take out targets. Multiple 'accidents' that can happen, usually a way to snipe your target.
- Speaking of sniping, it's something you have to unlock on each map by doing multiple play throughs first. So if that's your preferred style you'll have to play sneaky first.

Gameplay
- Everything is generally pretty good when it comes to gameplay. 
- There are some maps like Colorado where the AI will spot you doing things through bushes, boxes, clutter, etc.
- There a lot of small things that make the game feel good. Being escorted out of areas you're not supposed to be in, targets going into lockdown if they get alerted, throwing melee weapons to knock out people, securing camera surveillance footage.
- Unfortunately it feels very formulaic if you are doing things the 'right way.' Missions are typically: get disguise, setup 'accidents' for your 2 targets, get camera footage, leave.

Some people say this is to ""prevent hacking"" but a quick look at the global highscores shows people finishing missions in 0 seconds with a perfect score, and IOI doesn't seem to care about that.

I'll give this a thumbs up if they remove the shit DRM, or at least make it less restrictive (why can't I play my online saves after going offline??)."

This is such huge improvement over the older games. Better stealth mechanics, story(what little there is), and, above all, much better experimentation in stealth killing. Listing out the opportunities and the large amount of challenges for each mission as well as being able to achieve them without having to reach the end of the level increases the ease of experimentation. It was so nice to be able to simply load a previous save and change my tactic to go for different challenges and still earn the rewards for previous kills that were no longer possible in the later changed tactic. The challenge system gave this game SO MUCH value despite it only being 6 levels.

As for the cons, most of this game's value is tied to an always-online system. All progression, unlocks, challenges, and achievements(EVEN ACHIEVEMENTS?? WTF!!!). If you dont have a reliable connection or any internet this game could be considered a terrible Hitman game of the modern age.

Im at the extremists compound, and theres only a little bit of story between each mission, but it feels like little more than just being sent on contracts. I know, I know, Im a Hitman. but I have to say, i liked Absolution FAR more!  This just feels like trial and error. And while I appreciate the multiple paths, its almost TOO much! the levels feel much larger than needed for comlpetion, and the opportunities are given to you at the beginning. Its like just going and following the marks on the map! they can be turned off, but then youre kindve left clueless, because the areas are so large.

I dont know. at first glance, it seems great. but, its just not. I find myself just wanting to get through it, to see the story. Completely bogged down by the mundane missions. 

Its also online at all times.. For a single player game.. I have no interest in creating, yet another, account for a single player game, the password to which ill forget the next game I purchase from this developer! So i dont get any of the added goodies, if there are any...

If you enjoy replaying each mission over and over again, just to try different ways to kill, or if you care about a leaderboard, then you MIGHT enjoy it. But, I just dont see it. Otherwise, I do not recommend. Its just very bland, and repetitive. Thankfully, I bought it on sale, and went with my gut. Not purchasing Hitman 2!  Plus, 47 looks a bit strange...

Edit: The counter on the store page says Ive played 24.7hrs in total, and 15hrs in the last 2 weeks.. Ive never had this game before yesterday, so i dont understand how its claiming I have almost 10hrs more playtime, from a period before it was ever installed on my PC/account"

I have not only played but worked to get the Silent Assassin rating on every Hitman game since Blood Money. I'm at the point now where I simply cannot recommend these games anymore. Not because they are bad, but because they are so stupidly expensive and monetized for how little you get.

Blood Money had 13 missions (about the same as Hitman 1 and 2 combined) and, even at release, costed a mere fraction of what these games do. This is the better game of HItman 1 and 2 so if you have to get one, get this one. The story took me significantly longer to finish than Hitman 2 (7 hours).

If you bought everything for both games at retail with all DLC, my quick math tells me that'd be roughly $180. Let's be clear, this is not a $180 game. Not even close.

It's disgusting what IOI has done to this franchise and I simply can't support it anymore.

It's super short (took me only 16 hours taking my sweet time and beating most missions without changing my suit) and it's sad excuse for a story ends before it really even gets interesting.

I will say that this game was better than I expected. My favorite Hitman game was Hitman: Absolution, so I wasn't crazy about the many little ways in which this game departs from that formula, which I thought was perfect: the disguise system, the combat, blending in, pre-targeted shots, etc. Still, a lot of the classic elements are there and many are done very well. It's pretty fun to play, and I like the fact that it gives you hints along the way for completing specific challenges/kills, which makes it flow more smoothly. Still, it's lame that there's too little indication about whether you are still on-track to finish challenges about remaining unseen, etc.; this can lead to finishing a long level thinking you're going to get the challenge and then being sadly disappointed with no real explanation.

I think the worst part about this game, however, is really the story. Hitman games can have odd and somewhat stupid stories, but still somehow Hitman: Absolution's ridiculous and over-the-top characters were far more interesting than the small amount of story given in this game. This game takes place earlier, though still a good 20 years after 47 started his career. When the game gets to hinting about 47's origin it's half interesting, but otherwise the story is sparse and mostly uninteresting. While it's nice that each level takes place in an exotic location, there's no fluid movement between missions, so you don't get those interesting missions where 47 is being hunted down and has to either switch to more violent tactics or else get even more sneaky.

In conclusion: not a bad game, but nowhere near worth the asking price of all of the DLC levels."

482,0,0.548,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","[b]Hitman(2016) is a game about the professional assassination of high value targets using a wide array of tools in a variety of locales across the globe. It boasts intricate level design, many different abilities and interactions, and tons of NPCs. It's fairly dark, touting a more realistic and sober tone when it comes to violence. It's greatly hindered by its invasive DRM, which requires you to always be online, and greatly increases the game's loading times. It's great for what it is, but it's hard to recommend it to anyone other than fans. At the most, get it an episode at a time, and be sure you have a lot of bandwidth to offset the load times.[/b]


Hitman(2016) is split into several episodes, each revolving around one destination and a slew of important targets. You play as Agent 47, a contract killer who infiltrates secure locations and assassinates high profile targets. You use a variety of tools and disguises to inch your way closer to your prey, ultimately silencing the target with varying degrees of subtlety.

Each location is massive, with many items, npcs, and various pathways and side routes. It's quite impressive how dense and complex these locales are. Tools, switches, explosives, and even poisonable foods are present in abundance, just waiting to be tinkered with. The game can also handle hundreds of NPCs on screen at any given time, making locations feel vibrant and bustling.

A large portion of the game can be boiled down to learning the environment. The actual assassination is usually quick and simple, but the setup can take hours to jimmy into place. Expect plenty of reloading because of tiny mistakes as you plot out your mission strategy.


Alongside the core assassinations, the game features a lot of extra playtime in the form of challenges, escalations, and contracts. 

Challenges are fairly simple, being something akin to mini-achievements for each level. Some challenges are unique assassinations you wouldn't have thought of. Others are exploring odd locations or trying out unique infiltrations.

Escalations are tiered assassinations, that raise in difficulty as you complete them, and are usually focused on killing specific NPCs in a stock level. 

Contracts are user-generated assassinations, created by another player using the in-game contract creator, usually in the form of assassinating random NPCs in a stock level.

It's tough to say whether or not these features are entertaining. If you're the kind of person that wants a ton of replayability, you're likely to enjoy the challenge and escalation system. If you want user-generated content, you might enjoy the contract system. If you care for none of those things, then the game might end up being a bit short.

To put it into perspective, if you simply do each assassination once and don't bother with challenges or escalations, it'll likely take you 5-6 hours to complete. With challenges and escalations, it's probably closer to a hundred or so.

Some might see the glut of content as more of a good thing, others might feel cheated by a ton of padding and asset reuse. These extra features amount for 95% of the playtime.


Predictably, the game can be quite dark and violent at times. Hitman's atmosphere is very sterile, with a tone that feels very blunt or even relatable. This is a stark contrast to other shooters or violent games in general. Most shooters display a degree of hyper-reality, which helps detach from the nature of killing something. Team Fortress 2, Borderlands, Wolfenstein, GTA, Fortnite, etc. Even realistic games have a degree of separation, as you never really get to know the person you're shooting, or see their reaction to being shot. They are just faceless targets.

Killing someone in Hitman feels very real, and by extension makes the combat feel very blunt. It makes little attempt to glorify, moralize, or soften the grim nature of what Agent 47 is doing. You might pull a gun on someone, only to have them start pleading for their life, or panic and run away. It's not presented as comical, it's more frantic and unnerving.

There is something about watching a target interact with their friends or colleagues on their normal routine, luring said target to a remote location using a simple deception, watching in horror as they realize they are about to die, and then slowly strangling them to death with fiber wire. It's not glorious or righteous, it's just business.

If you have any kind of empathy for others, you're likely to feel a unsettled by some of the interactions. Throwing people in a fridge, stealing people's clothing, inducing vomiting, killing civilians, and chipping live people in a wood chipper. I'm not saying Hitman is wrong for its portrayal of the subject, or that people should be outraged or appalled, but it's worth pointing it out because it might affect one's enjoyment of the game. 

It is quite surprising to see a game that's a violent power fantasy, but also isn't trying to romanticize the sobering reality of contract wetwork.


Despite being an impressive piece of game design, it has a particularly huge fatal flaw.

[b]The DRM system in this game is incredibly aggressive, and agonizingly slow.[/b]

The game requires a constant internet connection, and constantly syncs your data with the Hitman servers. All challenges, unlocks, and progress requires contact with their servers. If you're offline for whatever reason, you can still play, but none of your accomplishments will be saved.

To make matters worse, the game interacts with the DRM every time you transition between menus, load a game, or load a level. These processes are extremely slow, meaning you're likely to spend a lot of time just waiting for icons to load on the level select menu, or for loading a quick save, or starting a new level, or restarting a level because you took the wrong gear. To give you an idea, a level load takes about 40-60 seconds. Menus take 3-7 seconds per transition.

Confusingly, your load time is based on your internet connection. I happened to test the game on multiple connections at different speeds. On a 50mb/s connection? 60 second load times. On a 1gb/s connection? 15 seconds. I toggled between them multiple times, and on a slow connection, the level would be loaded from my SSD long before the server finished validating. On a 1gb connection, the validation finished almost instantly, leaving a 12 second window for my SSD to finish up the level load.

If you don't have a good internet connection, the DRM could ultimately make this game unplayable, or at the very least, painful. For every little mistake, you've got a 60 second quick load to look forward to. This is a single player game, you shouldn't need a 500mb/s+ internet connection. It's just unacceptable.


I can't say if this is necessarily a game that most people will enjoy. I'm reminded of the Batman Arkham games. If you already enjoy Hitman, then this is a obvious buy. If you don't know anything about Hitman, or don't care for the concept, then you may not enjoy this. The best I can recommend is just trying an episode at a time. For the record, I struggled to finish this game due to boredom at the halfway point.


Hitman(2016) is a simple yet interesting concept that's executed extremely well. It's world is densely populated and surprisingly complex. It's tone is a stark contrast to the usual violence in video gaming, favoring something that is more realistic and stoic, than extravagant and detached. It's weighed down by an oppressive DRM system that constantly impacts one's ability to enjoy the game. If you're a fan, it's an no-brainer. Otherwise, pick it up an episode at a time, and get a faster internet to improve the load times.

It's best to just forget about the developer at this point since it appears after ticking off a large number of purchasers with this kind of backstabbing they didn't care to listen and only minimally removed some of the online-only, not all of it, which they should have done.

Hitman was a great series. A single-person stealth shooter that set a standard. It has become nothing but a joke now.

If you like having half your game unavailable because you don't want to be online and give IO unfettered access to your system, then this game has you covered all the way.

If you like your purchased, single-player game to be controlled by IO, they're your best buddy.

If you like to purchase something, whatever it is, and not have to worry that your missing something, this isn't a game you should buy or a company you should trust.

When I buy something, I like to know up front what I'm getting. It should be everything advertised. If it's not, it's a lie. That sums up what IO has become as a company and what it's game has become. You only get half of what you bought, unless (yes, there is the FORCED requirement) you want to allow IO to control what you bought. Not acceptable in any fashion.

Do not buy this game if you think you're going to get everything with it. You don't. IO wants to control your play. The special missions provided by the live-service don't justify locking out so much of the game material. 

You've been warned.

[/list]
The most annoying one is when you literally did everything the challenge description tells you to, there's no check mark after you finish the round. Turns out you need to interpret the description in a very specific narrow way. For example, ""killing someone with a neck snap"" requires you to snap his neck while the target is being subdued. If you snap his neck after the target being subdued or being attacked silently with a blunt weapon, the challenge doesn't count as is completed. So this game's logic is if you don't complete these actions in one row, the target is killed through pacification or unknown forces. There are so many situations in this game where you need to pacify them in order to not disturb the NPCs before them. Straight up killing them from behind with certain weapons will let the target make some noise to attract attention from the surrounding NPCs. The game's implementation of its assassination concept is filled with loopholes. Can't believe this soft reboot is much much worse than absolution and blood money. Did the game developers ever have a clear vision to execute this game?

Online-multiplayer marketing strategy being put onto a single-player game leads to devs putting no efforts into making a solid single-player game. ""Internet connection is required, so we as developers can update game content more frequently."" Seriously? Did you really update your content at that frequency level through the whole life span of Hitman 2016? ""Contract Mode is online-only."" Then why do I need to connect to the Internet to play Campaign Mode? By the way, Contract Mode is so brilliant that developers can count on these user-generated content to keep this game alive as long as possible so they can spend less or even no effort to add more maps, more modes and more mechanics to the game itself."

You can even, apparently, mimic people's voices over the phone so perfectly that no-one suspects a thing. 

I also managed to knock a man out, steal his entire outfit, his weapons and drag him to a bin and hide his body in it, all the while the guy's aide had his back turned on me, just like, 10 ft away.

Hitman: How to milk people for as much money as possible, while screwing over the fans that coughed up hard cash for the preorder and then got a gutted version of the game.

Hitman is not an MMO. But it forces you to play always online like it is one and it has enough 'downloadable content' to be one (Some of which was supposed to be special for pre-order people and now can just be bought)

All in all the game locks way, way too much behind paygates. it wants to be a 100-200 dollar game, but it just doesn't provide it. It has fewer levels than a call of duty game, many times enemies aren't even reskined, they're just copy and pasted into each new level, and there's no diverse voice acting. 

Go play blood money. This game could have been blood money 2, but unforunately it's just not worth it's price tag. Maybe someday when the price drops it'll be worth it, when you can play offline and keep all your stuff. but until that day arrives, this game will be given a thumbs down. Save your money and go get some other games. That hurts to say as a hitman fan, but this game is not what it's supposed to be.

[h1]Quick Summary [/h1]
Overall this game could be good, I just can’t play a stealth game that doesn’t have quicksave. I need that feature to save time from experimenting, setting up missions and just screwing up. I didn’t play anything beyond the first 30 minutes of the first mission before getting frustrated by not having this one feature that would save me from enjoying this game. This is weird for me because usually the gameplay is what makes me not want to play a game, never technical issues, I guess I never had one till now. I will say it is because it’s a console port because quicksave is a STAPLE OF PC GAMES.

    [*]I didn’t play enough to really talk about the game, beyond skipping the boring story parts, and seeing that it had a lot of challenges for each mission to give a lot of different ways to do each mission that would be fun to see them all play out. 
    [*]I stopped playing after I felt like I was spending more time in the menus saving/loading. The autosave is so sparse and I swear doesn’t work. You can lose a lot of progress if you rely on it. The game is very trial and error for your first play through and I can’t waste time on just setting up saves in a limited number of slots. So other missions to replay after setting up multiple challenges will have to be erased and can be multiple columns over. This is really nitpicky but my time is precious and after playing Shadow Tactics they got it so perfect I can’t do it any other way.

The Hitman games are a series of assassination sandbox/simulations with an emphasis on stealth. Various iterations have added/removed/tweaked many aspects, but the core has remained the same for the most part (the only exception being Hitman: Absolution, from what I hear, the only game in the series I have yet to play).

You are given your target(s) some intel, a loadout of tools/weapons, and you are set free to bring about death in whichever way you prefer. This particular entry in the series provide really nice visuals (very interesting architecture, color palette, and good visual fidelity), very well designed maps (a lot of different entry points, well placed opportunities to disguise yourself, slip in and out of your enemies' view unnoticed) and interesting (if a bit too scripted and on the nose at time) ways to deal with your marks, making them appear like accidents, or making sure the bodies are never to be found again. The game has very good voice acting, in my opinion, although the script fails the acting quite a few times.

The game does have a few flaws: the UI is an obvious bad port from console, sometimes the guards seem to have eyes behind their backs, the number of missions might be considered a little too small (although I think the overall length of the complete version of the game is fine as it is, actually), combat was never a strong suit of the series, and this seems to be no exception, sometimes the time it takes to be found out when wearing a disguise feels a bit arbitrary. The ""opportunities"" (which can be seen as scripted series of events you can set in motion to guarantee a kill) are a bit too obvious in the standard setting (with map markers and everything) while a little too obtuse if you turn off the markers. For example, certain NPCs look indistinguishable from the rest, making it hard to know which one is the ""right"" one, and sometimes the sequence of events is a bit too convoluted and feels arbitrary (which makes it hard to follow without markers as a result).

For a fan of the series, none of these made a difference in how much I enjoyed the game overall. It's always nice to find more and more ways to complete the contract you didn't notice before, and it's nice to figure out how to accomplish certain specific kills, and the creativity and flexibility in most scenarios is a joy.

So, why the negative review? The game uses a form of online DRM which is bound to cripple the game should they ever shutdown the servers. Since most of the tacked on online functionalities could work offline just fine, the obvious reason to implement them in such a way is to prevent piracy. What this means is that in offline mode you can't unlock new gear, complete challenges and if I remember correctly, online and offline saves aren't compatible. I am perfectly fine with them using online features to add modes that wouldn't be easy to implement or feasible otherwise (see the contracts designed by other users you can share, for example), but all the things I have previously listed are important for the game design, and yet are arbitrarily tossed into the online mode.

I didn't know the game featured such systems when I got it. I don't feel too upset about this, since I actually got the game in a bundle (a nice surprise, since I was planning to buy it for more), but a game with a ticking bomb inside isn't one I'd recommend spending any significant amount of money for.

I can't condone the extension of ""games as a service"" practices to formats where it doesn't belong, so I have to give a thumbs down. If you are not bothered by such things, I'd say buy it, or get Hitman 2, which I think also has a DLC to add all the missions from this one to it. Then again, I hear that game has some performance issues, so make sure to investigate those before the purchase."

There's a higher difficulty in the game, but the default difficulty, which should be the most balanced and fun, is just too boring and unchallenging.
Besides, revealing opportunity is also very uninteresting. NPC will automatically start conversations when 47 approaches, you can stand right in front of them and they will keep talking, revealing the crucial, sometimes confidential information. This is not what an eardropping should be like. I dont feel much impact after knowing the secrets, since I got them too easily. There are also some information lying around the map. Looking at them wont cost you any efforts. In many occasions, after getting caught trespassing, you can still look at those information and trigger waypoints while the NPC escorting you to exit the area.
The game will also pinpoint the location where you can get the right disguise for the objective, the key for the door, the key objective item etc. . There is no reasons to really pay attention to the information, you just have to follow the waypoint on your screen and you will complete everything at ease.
The scoring system is also problematic, there is no punishment for pacifying an innocent (in order to get a disguise). This basically discouraging players on finding an unworn uniform, which makes the game boring.
The graphics itself is good. But the 3D models they use are underdevloped, and unthoughtful, NPCs are wearing mostly the same outfits in every locations. The environment doesnt feel alive as much as in HITMAN Absolution. The game feel so repetitive this way.
All in all, I think this game rips immersion away from players, which is a big mistake. The elements are forcefully glued together. This game wants you to enjoy freedom on how you kill your target, but the amount of choices dont mean much when the game couldnt make you to want to make these choices.  The open ended, mission based approach detaches players from the game.


Pros
Big maps, non-linear level design structure
lots of opportunities  to explore, many ways to kill
less reliant on instinct (compare to Absolution)
has a feeling of cold blood assassin

Cons
Your actions dont matter in the game at all, since 47 cant be provoked, emotionally or logically. The only way to enjoy this game is to play it like you're writing computer codes.
The Cold blood type assassin is also a big downside. The main character is not interesting AT ALL. Compare to Absolution, 47 used to have a purpose, a mission, a goal that players can hold on to. But in this version, he feels like just another bold man with a barcode tatooed at the back of his neck.

Last mission at the Hospital:
There is a mission exit at the helicopter location, which is guarded by 3 high tier guards and the pilot. It is so RIDICULOUS that you can fly away with the helicopter without anyone stopping you. It takes at least a minute for a helicopter to take off isnt it? Why the helicopter could even be an exit? 
Many things to do in the game are such a nonsense. The game keeps reminding me that this is all PREPROGRAMMED rather than persuading me that this is an EXPERIENCE I would like to enjoy."

HITMAN was an interesting game for me to play because despite desperately trying to get into it, I did not like the gameplay. It features intensely complicated environments for you to complete your assassinations with a multitude of interactable items and methods for killing. The game really lost me because it felt so slow, and I mean painfully so. Not only do you need to complete the same mission over and over, albeit using different methods, sometimes you needed to wait up to 30 minutes in a mission for the correct events to unfold before making the assassination. I will not recommend this game unless you have a much higher patience level than I do."
549,4,0.4749,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go","It's a great game, but there are some serious downsides that need to be taken into consideration before buying it. First of all, there is not a lot of content, even with the GOTY edition. The game heavily relies on replayability, which doesn't actually exist here. After completing the main story, you just play the same levels over and over again, only doing something slightly different each time. You won't find anything new or refreshing by going back or playing the extra content.

Another major issue with Hitman (2016) is that the game requires internet access to play. This never affected me because I almost always have a steady connection to the internet. But why does a game that is purely singleplayer need a constant online connection to function? Unfortunately, this is now a growing trend in the gaming industry and it's absolutely ridiculous.

Lastly, you're better off buying Hitman 2 along with the Legacy Pack. This lets you play Hitman (2016) in Hitman 2. You'll get the remastered campaign and a more complete experience. However, Hitman 2 seems to be suffering from the same problems as this game, so spend wisely.

I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. Hitman (2016) is a fun, well put together experience that was ruined by a severe lack of content and an overpriced, episodic story. I'm just glad I got this game in a bundle for less than $15. Not recommended."
550,0,0.394,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","In 2016 I made a decision and it was to not buy this game until the full version was released. Here I am, 3 years later reviewing and sharing my experience after playing it for the past 4 weeks or so.

[u]Episodic content[/u]
This is the main reason I boycotted and waited this long to buy the full version at an 80% discount price.
If the episodes weren't done at the time of the release, then they should've taken their time to polish it as much as possible. You can see that the first mission in Paris, has lots of fun escalation contracts. As you go through the rest of the missions, escalation contracts and challenges become less frequent. 

[u]Replay value[/u]
This game relies heavily on replayability and I don't have a problem with that. In fact, I had a lot of fun completing the challenges and escalation contracts. But there's a problem which brings me to my next point...

[u]DRM (digital rights management)[/u]
As I said before, this game relies on replayability. Any casual player could go through all the missions in less than ten hours.
The only way to make the most of it is to complete the rest of the challenges. It turns out that the geniuses decided to save all the unlocks and challenges on their server so you have to be connected to the internet at all times in order to save progress.
If your game can't connect to the hitman servers, you're fucked. You can only play the main missions in offline mode. No unlocks and no challenges available.
Can anybody tell me why was this a good idea?
Saving them locally would've been nice but it looks like they weren't aiming for something good.

[u]Elusive targets[/u]
I guess they were aiming for something fresh with this one but it doesn't work for me. My time to play games is limited to a few hours a week because I have a job and bills to pay.
As you may know, I can't play them anymore because I bought the game ""too late"".
Again, what idiot thought this was a good idea?

[u]Soundtrack[/u]
The music and sound effects are forgettable. 
Previous hitman games had great soundtracks. This one sucks monkey butt. I'd rather stick my pointy nose up a rhino's ass than listen to this game's music. 
The sound effects also suck monkey butt. When you hide a body inside a closet, you can hear the same sounds as you would if you hide it in a big box. The collision of the body and the sound are completely out of sync.
Also, I miss that sound from Absolution when you snap somebody's neck. 

[u]Season 2[/u]
The first season is somewhat short.
Why create a separate game for season 2? Wouldn't it have been more convenient to make season 2 as DLC for this game instead?

It's not a bad game. but as a long time hitman fan it's not fun to me the same way the classics are. Missions in the classics felt so much more alive and personable. They were so much fun to explore and to mess around in. This games levels just feel like a check list, the feeling of discovery is destroyed by the game telling you everything. The feeling of play is destroyed by the game telling you to do everything and locking equepment behind grind/level progression. It's just moronic.

This just isn't how I would like other games to become so I doubt I can ever vote positively for the franchise while they keep doing this.

Pros: The game is beautiful. I started playing this long after release but I still loved the amazing environments we found ourselves in with each mission, it was very enjoyable and really pulled off this feeling that we/our character WAS at these awesome places.

The game is fun, there are many ways to go after something/the target and with player posted contracts, unlocks of new starting areas etc after leveling up, there is always more to do.

The main story was interesting, however little I saw of it.

Negatives: Now the main reasons I'm voting this down: it's because I don't agree with how it was done. After finishing the very short main story, I was left with feeling like the game was good and yet, extremely short and lacking in content for me because it relies too heavily on replay. 

Also, I liked the glimpses of the main story, but like the main campaign, it was cut short due to it being tied to the aforementioned.

Disappointingly, after finishing the main story, I tried one of the extra missions, the Paris christmas one, the targets were disappointing because they turned out to be a pair of thieves that walked carelessly everywhere - the difficulty was inexistent compared to the harder to access couple from the main mission. The cherry on top, when I reached the cellar in the basement, the game became very sluggish and unplayable, something that never happened through the entire main campaign - so I can only assume this is because it was an added extra mission made without much care.

This disappointing experience turned me off from trying the other extra missions or even replaying the main missions starting in a different area - replaying in general just isn't for me."

""I have a 1080ti and this game ran poorly""
Well, I have a 1080 and the graphics were cranked and average fps on a 1440p screen is 89fps....sooo sthap going to those adult sites, and downloading ram.
Graphics were good, and the large levels and intricate design were awesome.
Honestly the game itself ran fine, but there were tons of points when triggers wouldnt activate, targets would glitch into walls/floors ect. or would never even move anywhere just T-posed in their start location but their voices could be heard (wherever their bodyguards were).
The game baaaaarely kept me engaged, a good hook or tense moment and then an ass grinding halt to complete boredom waiting for some key point (made worse when the ai borked).
The ""point system"" and achivements were... a turn off for me... don't punish me for playing the way I want to play. Yes obviously turning this rouge game into an fps would kill the game, and that is not what I am asking for.
Speaking of AI, its a little too cheaky at times *shoot someone and run far away and hide in a locker without being seen* enter le random guard on the other side of the map ""found him"".
Replayability-..... none.... I just played nearly 20 hours (most of wich were spent taking care of my newborn while the game was paused) and realized that I played the SAME level reskined several times.

In the end I was left wanting more, yet I cannot even bother playing the game over again for the achievements.

Those are just things I wish I'd known before buying. It is worth saying, however, that if you do own this one, you will get the Legacy Pack for free in Hitman 2 (that's why I said that you should compare prices).
Happy hunting!

But the AI is just so damn buggy, unless you follow the scripted ""opportunities"" in which you perform actions in sequence to kill the targets via methods like tricking them into killing each other or having an accident with sabotaged equipment, then the game really falls apart. Every other time you take down a guard the others will psychically know what you did even if there are no witnesses. You can shoot someone in the head with a silenced pistol from a position where only the target had a clear line of sight although their back was turned to you, and so long as someone saw the person die then even if they didnt have a clear line of sight to you they will instantly know where you are and what disguise you are wearing

In short, this is meant to be played out like an adventure game. The game points out the line you have to follow to make the scripted deaths occur and if you try to step off the line it has drawn for you the whole thing falls apart because the AI is severely buggy and the scripted kills were designed to hide it"

But then comes the story, written by a 10 year old who read books they did not understand and the setting made up by a 6 year old that gets bullied in school. Both break any sense of immersion or reality.

You don't even play the actual story, which is supposed to play in the background in a cheap excuse for not coming up with a plot. You fight the Illumniati and they are utterly moronic. You fight science that is utterly moronic. You go on to assassinate high profile targest that just happen to walk under 10 pianos all secured flimsily and you just have to decide which piano should kill the target (the pianos DO get harder and harder to sabotage in a brilliant way though).

The whole premise is so childish it defies belief. It all hinges on you being Leon the Professional instead you are a sulky teenager in a world where everyone else is braindead.

A minor gripe (depending on the level it gets more important): the bystanders feel like zombies. Some NPCs are scripted, those are fine. The ones that are not feel like they came from two decades ago.

Over time I contemplated the feeling. I knew something was wrong, but what. I slept, and the question escaped me. I went days, months, years without thinking about it, but recently that changed. As I stepped on the stool, and put my head through the rope I thought back. Back on what all once was, and while remaniceing I thought of this game. I thought of fond memories, and of the fun I had while playing. It brought my joy. I removed my head from the rope, and thought about it more, but soon I remembred.

After the episode it was confirmed that over 100 had died by my hands, and thoughout the pain and suffering nothing changed. This game wasn't kirbys epic yarn, and it couldent be. This ate away at me. How could I remember enjoying something so much, and yet it had not kirby, or yarn. I realized it must be a spell put on my by the developers, and set off on my second journy. When I reached their HQ it was late, and everyone had left. I waited in a bush for my prey to return. Upon first sight I sprung, and retreated back in to my previous state of rage.

The mechanics work fine and the pace of the game feels overall good.

My biggest problem is that it is in no way a real Hitman game.
What i mean is that the feeling you get when you play the ""story"" aspect of  the game is more that the developers tried to build Hitman into a sort of awkward online PVE game.

Many of the previous games tried to establish 47 as almost human, but in the new game he honestly have less personality than the average silent protagonist.

Again - the gameplay is fine, but the story and the soul of previous Hitman games just isn't there.

The game also suffers from the atrocious ""Give us more money!"" syndrome - meaning you end up having to pay 3 times the normal retail price for what feels like 50% of a full game. The whole episodic release and ""play this map 6 times to unlock everything"" is not really what i think is fun and engaging gameplay.
Don't get me wrong! I don't personally mind grinding games, and played the bath hotel map in the oldest Hitman game over and over again, trying to find better ways to kill the target - but that was by my own choice and because the map itself back then offered so many options and felt alive.
The new maps in Hitman somehow fails to make the NPC feel alive.

The difficulty is also all over the place - from ""walk in the park""-mode where the enemies are both blind and deaf to the hivemind mentality of ants with wallhack.

Overall hitman core mechanics are good but the end result is a game riddled with more holes than the plot of the Hitman story so far."

When I imagine a next gen Hitman game I think of one with adaptive gameplay and dialogue trees that allow you to interact and manipulate NPCs to do certain actions.

Nowadays it's a comedy game.

Did you know that Hitman's NPC's lungs are in their feet?
Well, neither did I. Drag a body and accidentaly hit their feet in water instantly kills a non target. Whew!

Did you also know that Hitman NPC's are also all quantum entangled? Attack a target who doesn't utter a sound but sees you and you set off the collective mind with no visual contact with you. But throw a large object against the wall that result in a big bang renders no suspicion. Weird. Laughable.

Hide behind something with someone looking the other way but you are somewhere in the corner of their eyes and you're slowly becoming suspicious from 50 meters away without somebody actually looking at you. And then hide behind a box or similiar with your hair sticking up... Wait, something's wrong with that sentence... Anyway, they notice your from 25 meters away behind a box taller than you crouching... SUSPISCIOUS BOX!

Hokkaido. In target's bathroom. Drag a body in the toilet and drop it below the sink. Target sees the body through the wall from livingroom and ask's 'Why are you not wearing any clothes?' and then comes running in. Mission failed. Collective consciousness and clairvoyant! The game just switched genres from crime to sci-fi! Hot damn! Can games just STOP being broken?

And then the story is just crap compared to other games. No emotional impact. Nothing personal. Just business... I guess. Kill targets. Leave.

I will play it because all previous games have been great. Or maybe I just weren't aware of these petty details that actually break the experience altogether back when they were released? Refuse to think of it. La-la-la-la....

Pros : 
Gameplay is as enjoyable as all the previous parts.
Graphics are good for a game released in 2016.

The 'Patient Zero Campaign' DLC was quite interesting. I'm absolutely against buying DLCs of any game but this one was worth it.

Cons :
One thing which was not carried over from Hitman:Absolution to this game was the thrill, energy, and speed of the story. This series has always produced amazing stories(from Hitman 1 to 5) and that's what made it so enjoyable. However, this one has quite a slow story, even if interesting. The worst part is that the story is incomplete implying that the developers were trying to force customers of Hitman Season 1 to buy Hitman Season 2. It hasn't been left unfinished in a smooth and subtle way which would hint at a sequel. It's been left unfinished quite boldly almost as if the developers were trying to say,""Stay tuned.

The ridiculous, over-the top concept of this series which made it fun has mellowed and now these games take themselves far, far too seriously. The story is just too campy now; and I don't write that lightly, because we are talking about hitman, here. Every person you assassinate is some kind of super bad-ass, and all the NPCs are assholes, it makes you feel more like some kind of trite, ultra-virtuous vigilante than the anti-hero, ""do whatever I'm payed to do"" hitman of old.   It's an unfortunate carryover from the attitude that Absolution brought to the series, but I guess it entertains simpler minds. ""I'm a killer but I'm the good guy, always."" 

On the gameplay side, I really miss being able to customize and upgrade weapons. That was one of the most fun elements of Hitman: Blood Money. Now I guess you have to complete missions in a certain way to unlock new guns that still aren't customizable, which I haven't done because I don't give enough of a shit about these boring-ass levels to replay them. Why remove customization entirely?  I don't want to grind for different-looking guns that do the same fucking thing; I'm not playing COD. On that note, when the hell are you supposed to get a sniper rifle in this game? What stupid, boring task do you have to complete in which pre-paid level? Hitman should have a sniper rifle, end of story.

The gameplay heavily favors the stealth route, which scratches the puzzle solving itch, but that's only half the fun of these games. I feel like it's been made nearly impossible to just go in guns blazing; every single shot fired by an NPC, no matter how far away or from what angle, seems to hit you square in the face. It just seems like lazy programming. I'm afraid the devs have gotten a taste of what a market comprised of apathetic gamers can let them get away with, and now they're just polishing turds, cutting them up into pricey ""DLC"" packages and releasing them, piecemeal, for any screaming kid whose parents will buy them mature games. All of this combined with an increasingly intrusive and impractical privacy/online policy, and I think this game deserves a big, stinking thumbs down across the board.

Whether it's the result of executive meddling, poor design, or too much ganja, HITMAN has such a flaw.  It is perhaps best known as “online single-player” mode.

[h1]As for the game proper…[/h1]

Graphics:  The scenery is amazing, but I had to drop down to 720p to keep it at a playable framerate (though I'm pretty flexible in that regard, I was getting 20fps and lower at 1080p).  That could just be showing my system's age, though.  I'm sure on a newer rig it looks even better.

Sound:  No complaints.  (Well, except the blaring catwalk music at SANGUINE:ICE, but I'd probably complain about that in real life, too.)

Gameplay:  It's a little more guided than Hitman: Absolution, likely to help ease new players into the game (plenty of times in H:A I remember thinking, ""okay, [i]now[/i] what do I do?"" since I hadn't played the older entries) but you have the option to turn off hints and ""Opportunities"" for a purer experience.

639,0,0.5614,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I was hoping I would enjoy this game more than the linear Absolution. I do enjoy moments here and there, but the sandbox levels just make the main campaign missions more confusing. In previous games, the maps were tailor made for the campaign missions and so every item could be used to take out the target(s). In this game, items are just scattered around the map and you may never need them in any situation within the campaign (besides just goofing off). 

They should call this Hitman: Trial and Error. I end up saving every minute and retrying so many times it is no longer fun. Everything you do, someone seems to see you. Witnesses are around every corner. You start each mission with only the most basic items. You can't seem to customize any weapons and you don't even have the iconic dual Colt .45s. You have to replay each level to unlock items. By time you unlock everything, you won't even need it since you will have memorized the entire map and every scripted event. I paid for the game of the year edition and I have to replay each level 10 times to unlock something as simple as poison. In the older games you had a large assassin stash of weapons to the point of having too many items to choose from. 

For me the series peaked at Blood Money and has gone down hill since. I think I will pass on future installments if they are going to keep making these monster maps and force you to be ""connected"" to get all content."

647,0,0.8566,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","In my opinion, Hitman Absolution was better than this Hitman... in almost any shape and form.
I'm not saying this one's bad, it's just... meh. As an Hitman game, or simply as an infiltration game.

So, the good points are the graphics, and the large panel of possibilities you have access to. Some levels are also very nicely designed (the one in Paris for instance). I also liked the many small talks the npcs were having, as most of those foreshadow the coming events and I think it's a nice touch.

However, the AI is absolutly laughable, which often ruins the infiltration and the immersion, even on professional. There's also a huge difference in quality between levels. For instance, the aforementionned Paris level is great. There's a lot to do, it's huge, tons of costums/weapons and the ambiance is fantastic. Then you get Marrakesh. Stale, boring, repetitive. Hokkaido? Nice, an interesting game mecanic, great environnement, a cameo. But you had to go through Colorado before that. An uninspired farm/military compound.
The voice acting is good for the main characters/targets, however for the minor characters.... it's terrible. Why is a Thaï speaking with a british accent?
Why did they remove the old point system, which showed your score in real-time? At least I knew when i was discovered, or if a body was found, as it had an impact on my score, impact i could notice right away. Now i've to check that stupid feed on the top-right hand corner of my screen, and sometimes that won't even show up (it happened to me several times in Marrakech).
There's also no story. You cant call that a story. Go there, kill that dude, [spoiler] you're getting manipulated... no rly?	[/spoiler].
Finally, I think the gunfights are quite... underwhelming. good thing you're not supposed to fight, but I'd have loved, from time to time only ofc, to just pick up a gun and kill everyone in the level.
Moreover, there's no ""bullet time"" anymore. I guess it was to force us to avoid fighting multiple targets. Kinda dumb in my opinion. Honestly i do not like beeing told what to do, especially in a videogame. If i want to shoot my way through an infiltration game, let me do so. And obviously it's still doable, easily even. Yet it lacks those ""1v9"" moments when you shoot a whole room in a second.
And that's my last point. If the environnements are often majestic, 47 is never badass. I suppose they put the emphasis on the ""blank slate/no emotions"" part, and also on the fact he tries to be as discrete as possible. But I do not think having him be a little more charismatic, whether through his actions or his behaviour, would have hurt. The game lacks in the jaw-dropping moment departement.

If you're looking for one of the best infiltration game on PC, then play MGSV. It is a better game in every regards.
I also recommend the other Hitman games, and Splinter Cell."

656,4,0.5357,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go","Hitman has been one of my favourite series for a long time, this version of the series, however, I canNOT recommend. The main reason is that you can end up not being able to enjoy the full content of  the game and as a paying customer this is simply inacceptable. IO offers so-called ""Elusive Targets"" which are mainly different in two respects: 
1) They are available for a limited time only, then they're gone. Meaning if you have work or family commitments at that time, you may well miss out although you bought the game and paid for it.
2) If you fail those missions you cannot re-attempt them. As every game has its bugs and glitches, its inconsistencies and its list of little things that don't work properly this is not right. It can be a minor issue like a guard spotting you although he actually shoud not be able to see you from where he is or someone bumping into you and blowing your disguise without reason. As with the time issue, this can lead to you not being able to (re)play the mission although you paid for it.

Hitman is a product for which the developer, in this case IO, asks the customer to pay and that's fine. However, this means the developer shoud not include any features, possibilities or circumstances that lead or can lead to the player being locked-out of part of the game, not even out of a single contract for an elusive target. If you've paid for it, you should not be denied access.
Unless you have unlimited time every day and every week, every month, I recommend NOT buying this game as there's  a good chance you'll pay for content you cannot enjoy. No matter how good a game may be per se, if the developer potentially denied the customer parts of a game he/she bought, that's a No-Go."

662,0,0.6457,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","*update: i have bought and played the full game in less than 30 hours*

Game is basically easy hand holding maps and replay gimmicks. Nothing creative enough and player driven enough to be fun. I felt like i couldn't create my own kills. Only a handful of predefined kill points.

This has always been a weakness in the hitman series that needs to change. 

My old review still stands.

*Old review*:

I have played both the demo and the free colorado map. From what ive played, this game IS NOT worth 60 dollars. Basically they just take several maps and do the ""repeat the level w/ challenges"" gimmick to add hours to the game. The content is basically only the level missions and that's all. All the silly challenges, hard modes, unlocks, etc etc are just variations on each map that has you win in different ways. 

The map ""kill points"" are entirely set up for you when it comes to the creative kills. You just have to discover the way the devs  have set up the map for kills. Not very challenging beyond learning how the AI works. The enemies path the EXACT SAME path everytime, so its just a matter of choosing the technique and executing it. 

The opportunity points were terrible. All a handholding mechanic that has the devs doing it all for you. Im sure it might be harder in hard mode, but its still silly to say the least. Waypoints lead you to the exact locations you need to go to. You get there either via stealth or disguise. Same old same old. Rinse and repeat. Kill ""creatively"" via predifined kill strats, or do it manually. The formula becomes very easy to spot very quickly.

Not worth 60 bucks.

If you love doing this, pay 60.

If you dont, wait for the game to drop. How low? Im waiting for less than 10. But 20-30 may be ok too."

It's your typical Square Enix over-complicated buIIshit control scheme, which ruins the whole game process. 

This is a game about the master assassin, who, by definition, needs to be very precise; timely; surgical.

Instead of solving the missions, you're forced to battle with these controls. It will break your planning, spoil your experience, and ruin your day. This is like needing to run somewhere, and, on your own, being able to run, but there's a retaгded dog who jumps at your feet and jumbles your coordination.

Beautiful visuals. Every location feels like a real place, it's insanely detailed and carefully drawn.

682,0,0.6821,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I grew up playing the Hitman games, and have very fond memories of them. I've played all of them to date, and it is with a heavy heart that I do not recommend this particular installment. 

Superficially, the game is OK. However, the ""deeper"" you look into any one feature, the less impressed you become.

The graphics look pretty good until you start clipping through NPC's as you walk, notice the really weird way in which the character moves when performing certain actions, and that sometimes NPC's will talk without their faces moving at all. Your character will also ""float"" over to an interactive object when you're close enough to engage with it, but not in the precise position for the animation. Games fixed these problems a decade or more ago, but these people couldn't manage it. 

At least the game play seems pretty cool - at first glance. You have a fair amount of options to pick from, or so it seems at first blush. However, the way things are implemented leaves a lot to be desired. For one thing, 47 is apparently a GOD of non-lethal take-downs. Using a wrench, crowbar, brick, or any other number of implements he will either smack someone over the head such that they simply pass out, or unerringly throw said item at their heads as if they were heat seeking missiles, with the same result. Funny enough, if you lock on to an NPC for said head-shot, and they happen to walk around a corner, your projectile will still connect. You can pick up as many of these implements as your heart desires. It's not unusual for me to finish a mission with several crowbars, wrenches, and hammers - where the heck 47 fits them in his well tailored suit I'll never know.

How you deal with those poor unconscious bastards is annoying as all heck, however. For all that 47 is built like a Greek God, he will drag bodies noisily across the floor instead of say, picking them up and throwing them over a shoulder. A remarkable number of empty closets and bins are also available for you to hide said bodies in. This franchise is a decade old, are you seriously telling me you can't find a better way to deal with bodies?

But as ridiculous as all of the above is, I could pretty much live with it if it weren't for the terrible ""story"".

One very annoying fact that I could no longer ignore when I hit the fourth mission is that even though 47 is an unscrupulous killer working for an agency that will essentially take anyone's money, every target is somehow a despicable person. Not only is the world a better place without them, but you're actually saving the planet / delivering justice by taking their lives! We're playing an ASSASSIN FFS, we don't need a warm fuzzy reason to take down the target.

They also work the SJW agenda into the game in various ways, such as your target being a white guy who murdered a black actress, and getting away with it because the racist system found him innocent. Or a pair of evil masterminds, of whom the woman is - of course - the brains, while the guy is the silly side-kick who's blunders she has to fix. They're not even subtle about it.

On top of all this you can't customize your guns! The way you unlock new weapons and gadgets on any given level is by performing challenges (more on that later). Furthermore, anything other than the pistol shoots like cr@p. Assault rifles or SMGs are ALL OVER THE PLACE. You'd think that a clone literally bred for the job would be a better shot.

The final straw is that instead of creating complex, and lengthy levels, they try to pad the game by having you replay each level countless times, and simply killing the targets in different ways in order complete challenges. This in turn unlocks more options for future play throughs of that level. Excuse me if I don't waste my time listening to the same conversations, and waiting for targets to walk down the same old boring corridors for the 10th time.

All in all, the game reeks of mediocrity, and I'm not particularly impressed."

However, being online is necessary for most of the game to actually work. While this may not sound like a problem, it can result in it spitting you out of the game because your connection cuts out temporarily.
The real kick in the groin however, was after having spent an hour finishing a mission perfectly, only to have the debrief show that I had done so, but still not recieving the challanges or it.
Why? Because my internet had cut out at one point in the middle of the mission.

Hell even rating score locked behind online only BS. I don’t mind if I don’t get any unlockable weapons or gears or progression or starting location during a hard time in offline occurrence, but locking out rating system behind online is too much for consumers like me to handle.

yup, THE ENTIRE SCORING SYSTEM AND DIFFICULTY OPTIONS locked behind online only content is the worst of all in this new HiTMAN games since they go independent, (now they got new publisher; WB) I really don't mind if they lock items, gears, starting location, or fucking sniper rifle behind online only wall content but fecking ENTIRE SCORING RANK SYSTEM AND DIFFICULTY OPTIONS?!?! that's so restrictive on consumer base that buy your products, this is like EA game as a live service but worse than that, HiTMAN games shouldn't be live service product!!

Developers should have a Plan B in their mindset for the unforeseen future of HiTMAN franchise, with it server. still despite that, locking something that tell you whether what you achieve in mission, what rank did you get, is not cool at all, it's torturing people who own the game & pay them. single player game but game as live services? people pay those products but you never really ""own"" the product?! mind you maybe I'm just the minority here, I'm fine without not having weapons/ gears unlocks in offline, I JUST wish the difficulty options & what rank you get after level will work in offline mode, just like previous HiTMAN ever since.

My wishlist for HiTMAN 2, I hope IOI will make rating score rank & difficult option unlock for offline gameplay mode, since whenever my connection going flip flop, after finishing some level the game don't tell me what rank I got, is it silent assassins? is it hitman? is it murder spree? so yeah, just wish for the better experience of hitman no matter if where you want to play(due to work travel).

To summarize my review, if you play the game while offline/ or have low average internet connection/ server in maintenance, after you finish the level successful eliminate the target, you will not see what RANK you got!!!!! yes! offline mode mean no rating rank system like in previous games where in Blood Money you can see your score & what rank you got but in this modern HiTMAN games, nope fecking hell. I hope IOI devs read this so they can understand the frustration of a single player but with fecking restriction on the certain basic from previous games."

When I read that I thought the issue was barely noticeable. Boy, I was wrong.

I would've been fine by this, but IO themselves ruined it. Connecting to the server takes ages and even if it did, it'll give you errors(I even waited for more than 15 minutes and still got the error). Also did the Winsocket (all 3 of them) resets, still nothing. People say its a common problem but not even once I have seen a post that seemed to solve it.

Playing the game in offline mode felt like I didn't pay for the game at all. Missing out on events, challenges, different areas to start(w/ disguise), change starting loadouts, and saved weapon unlocks is very abhorrent, its locking out my creativity. I even bought this game solely for playing w/o internet.

The problem is that the game requires the player to be connected to the hitman server to be able to access most of the content. This shouldn't be the case in a single-player game. Even worse, the servers don't even work. I still haven't been able to connect even once.

the equipment you take in the mission is limited for some reason you cannot choose any suit or weapons you want and start with them. all non pistol weapons must be found within level for some reason and most disguises are locked off permanently.
disguise system is wonky as some random people with a cricle mark over their head are going to see through your disguise for some unknown reason
when you get spotted and things go sideways the amount of npcs that notice player is totally insane. They also magically home in on your position even if they never saw you.
all in all the game to me feels like the tech demo where they were testing how many npcs they can cram in every possible location with no rhyme or reason. every level I tried is littered with npcs not in a good way
its not a bad game its just very average from gameplay side polluted with always online to be able to play it at all and infuriating dlc practice."

The graphics are beautiful, there are many ways to assassinate your targets and the added challenges are a nice touch.
BUT and this is the main reason why I wouldn't recommend this game is the ridiculous attempt of an explanation for why the game requires a permanent internet connection. They claim in their EULA, which you have to accept before playing, that in order to provide the best experience for players and to prevent modders/cheaters from achieving impossible scores in the global rankings, the game needs a permanent connection. This is a straight out lie! If you look at the global rankings of mission scores, you'll see thousands of players with impossible to achieve scores. Those scores are that high because they include absurd time bonuses. A mission time of 00:00:09? Nine seconds? Yeah, right! Guess IOI's anti-cheating system is worthiless and they can revert the game to not require a permanent internet connection. Seriously, nothing, absolutely nothing in this game requires you to be always on! They just want to farm your data and they aren't even honest enough to tell you that. Instead they hide behind their lie of the necessity to have a permanent connection to prevent cheating/modding on the global rankings. Nobody cares about how good their scored was!

That's why I would NOT recommend this game to anyone! I got it during the last sale for little over 17 Euro and I still wouldn't recommend it, even at that price. It's one thing to choose an adequate DRM which requires you to register/activate your game ONCE online, and a totally different thing when you're forced to have a permanent internet connection just to enjoy the game, for which you paid good money, fully. 
IO Interactive please take a look at CDProject Red and their approach with The Witcher 3. That's how you treat your customers with respect!"

- Online at all time (or get a popup lol)
- Taken through everything like a baby, dumbs down the game to a long QTE
- Hand to hand is litteraly a QTE
- Just standing somewhere will make people suspicious up to the point where they might shoot you
- On the other hand you can come and go trespassing a restricted zone, in front of a guard, 50 times, and nothing will happen
- Shooting is hilarious, thanks to the 3rd person camera you can shoot while being entirely under cover, the gun will magically shoot behind walls and AI will just charge you
- Game gives you additional ""Challenges"" when the game itslef should already be a challenge
- Regeneration à la Call Of Duty, makes any combat encounter negligeable as you do not have any penalty for taking damage.
- Tutorial popup requires to press Enter to skip
- First missions are supposed to be fake assassinations / reconstitutions, yet you can murder everyone and escape in a wooden helicopter. Way to break any immersion / seriousness
- Graphics are somewhat unoptimized at some points, especially heavy aliasing (even with maxed AA) and drops framerates (60 fps dropping to 20). Also happens during cinematics, beautiful 20 fps cinematics
- The main menu is a _s h i t s h o w_, the only thing that should be dumbed down is now overloaded (also don't forget about that sweet microtransaction ad)
- Still have no idea how to boost difficulty
- Missions are sold as having a lot or replayability to excuse their pitiful number


Pros:
- You can tweek the HUD and disable all help, virtually increasing difficulty (just makes missions longer, not really harder)
- The item throwing is fun
- Melee animations are fun

----------------------------------
EDIT: After playing some more, here are additional points:

Cons:
- The key to silently incapacitate someone is the same snapping an unconscious person's neck. Hence, hitting the key several time in the midst of a fight will probably snap an innocent's neck (gotta commend 47 on that impressive skill) and ruin your no save + no innocent kill run.
- I have yet to see a mission where being compromised has a bigger consequence than the VIP hiding in a predefined spot. idk, after I killed 300 civilians and 100 security details, escaping would seem like a great idea...


Pros:
- Throwing axes and swords into people is really fun
- Bashing people with axes and swords is really fun
- Hearing NPCs reactions to you ridiculously murdering people with axes and swords is really fun
- Some challenges will unlock new gear, some of them being ridiculous which is fun."

Graphically I don't mind this game. I think it's well balanced. I dont know where performance issues that everyone are having are coming from though, so the devs didn't do a very good job there, which is annoying.

----- The main problem I have with this game (even with more than 240 hours played) ----- 
Is that  this game constantly wants to hold your hand through events called Opportunities... Hit F1 to start an opportunity. You can't just kill people a certain way if you know how. You actually have to go to a certain location, find some information about something - through overhearing a conversation or a note - and then go to the next step of this way of killing someone.

You then follow a very linear chain of events which link you very neatly to killing someone a certain way. Your agent or employer will even tell you all about it in the game, so you don't get to discover anything yourself. You can indeed turn this stuff off, but the opportunities are actually so linear and scripted, that you can mess it up or not even find it. You're much better off just letting the game take you, which is annoying. Why not just let there be many posibilities and you put together the ones you like the best?

Why make a sandbox assassination game feel THIS scripted? You're supposed to just have fun with it, but instead the game is about doing things the exact same way the devs wanted you to. Improvisation or being clever etc etc doesn't really matter. It mostly comes down to doing something that was meant to happen.

An example is in Paris where you can activate a fireworks display. Both targets will walk out to look at it, and you can snipe them from afar. The game tells you about the remote, the fireworks, and tells you where it is. But that's great isn't it? Being able to snipe someone because you're working as a professional killer and the sniper is a very popular weapon used by assassins? Well it doesn't happen often, I'll tell you that. And if you do, people turn crazy until they find you anyway. Suddenly everyone can see through your disguise and shoot you on site. This is NOT a game where you improvise anything.

----- Your game is scored -----
That's good in a way I suppose, you can brag about being really good or something. You can also with this score unlock things. Hitman Blood Money had money in it. You are now hired in that same company, but there's no cash, customization or any other fun thing(s) like that. A silenced rifle and a non-silenced rifle are not the same rifle... So if you just happen to do 5 hard ""challenges"" or achievements in a mission, you might get a rifle with a different color than the ridiculously awful purpleish blue you had from before. But... You never use these weapons anyway, because there are so many guards and civilians in the game that killing ANYONE means the whole army will be gunning for you, and the targets will be escorted to a safe place.
- Another horrible thing about the game being scored is that you might do a certain thing in the game like killing someone a certain way or finding a weapon SIMPLY for the score, and not for the fun of it.
- Another bad thing about that is that you're so caught up in your score that if someone spots you doing something bad, you're likely to restart the mission. People do spot you quite easily in this game, mostly because there are simply so many people around crammed together in almost any room. This again makes you really scared of being spotted, making you save the game regularly so that if some idiot sees you and alerts almost everyone around you in 1.5 seconds, you wont have to restart. This ruins the exploration and immersiveness of the game, and instead adds frustration.

The UI is ridiculous in the game. It's about the same as the start menu in Windows 8. Windows then got updated to Windows 10. Hitman stayed the same.

Another chain of horrible, outdated stuff, is that if you wanna climb something you hit X... WHEN PROMPTED TO and he will get into a climbing position. You are then in ""climbing mode"" and can climb up and down. You then reach a ledge, and will have to enter ""ledge mode"" by hitting a certain button WHEN PROMPTED TO. You then walk this ledge and maybe you want to jump up to the ledge above you? Simply hold upwards and then hit a certain button WHEN PROMPTED TO. You then go to the end of the ledge, and you hit a certain button when prompted to YET AGAIN, to end ledge-climbing mode. The game is simply horribly stiff and not very smooth in that sense. Yet the game was released in 2016. If you're on a roof, it's the same thing. You're not allowed to jump down from the roof. You can only move about where the devs say is ok. But... I wanna jump down from here, why can't I? Why am I not allowed to do things the way I want to do them? Very outdated and annoying mechanics that remove a lot of immersiveness, yet the game is trying to be realistic.

What pulled me into the game, was how much content and how alive each level feels. This is mostly the first and second mission to be honest. (By content I do not mean escalations, because they suck and feel like a chore). But over time, I realized more and more that this game should have been more fun, more open, purer, less demanding, and generally better made technologically.

Now its finally free to play and I'm glad I stayed away. 

first things first. What a total fucking unacceptably bad options menu. You got 1-0 keys available. But can you use them to select weapons faster? NO. WHY ? Because idiots that downgrade their games. No weapon wheel, just gotta hit I for inventory EVERY fucking weapon or gear swap. Freezing your game, having you lose TOTAL control of your character and drag your hand to the right. fucking why?? Blood Money and Absolution didn't fucking have this problem? Honestly. How the fuck did this miss quality assessment? So Clunky

It gets even more retarded when you try to exit the game. Hitting escape button. Nothing happens. Enters main menu, then looks at corners for exit game option. Not there. No
To exit a game now, you gotta go into options menu ???????????
Fucking serious? 

What an annoying beginning to this. How about the game itself ? 
Well the way missions are selected is outright borderline. Idk if I'm fucking playing a game or doing shopping on an Ipad. Option after option as I browse content instead of just hitting fucking campaign, singleplayer, go, lets play and enjoy the game. 

Instead I'm stuck with these weird choices. Cutscene- cinematic- cutscene- mission season 1, cutscene, Like what the fuck... this is so BETA. Like the devs trying to keep an overview of their content. You dont make a game like that. You hit singleplayer and if the player wants to SELECT missions make a tab called "" Mission Select"" Boom. 

This is a terrible interface. So unimmersive. 

And now to what really kills it for me. The fact that the tutorial treating us like a complete idiot is forced upon us. Easy, boring, shit level design missions in a fucking huge bunker/hole with a house or boat that just stands there. And we're supposed to take this crap seriously. How everyone is just there to party or do guard duty, and Im going in to kill them
You're in a fucking huge hole in the ground. Straight out of Metro. 

So fucking weird and immersion killing. They've done this better before. Blood Money, last hitman game I liked had a cool intro. Long, fun mission that introduces us to 47's line of work, ways of killing etc. 
Not some fucking boat in the middle of a bunker that you complete in literally 120 seconds MAX taking 2 uniforms and killing 1 guy then walking 20 yards, Done. The End. Or just 1 uniform, shoot the guy, run and hit and hold G to exit mission ( Why hold G ? Is this a fucking console game?) 

Jesus fucking christ. We've We've had far better in the past. When 47 wasn't just some clueless jackass that has to prove himself because reasons I wont even bother googling to figure out. 

Horrible way to start the game. And especially since its not even remotely the first game in the series. People fucking know these games so make these shit ass low effort tutorials optional.... -_-. I can't even be bothered to complete the 3rd one because its LITERALLY the same damn mission 3 times in a fucking row, in the same hole, with the same strategy. 

Honestly. What the fuck. The tutorial of Blood Money was so good and made you feel like you were on a real mission. Real contract because you WERE. 
1st real mission of Blood Money was the columbian drug lords mansion. SO MANY WAYs of getting in. Of doing stuff and guards that weren't total fucking idiots. 

Apparently shooting civillians take 5 fucking bullets now unless you headshot them too.... is this meant to disencourage killing civillians? Why are you telling me how to play the game when you LITERALLY FUCKING GIVE ME AN ASSAULT RIFLE IN PROLOGUE MISSION 2. 

And oh yeah. About that assault rifle. Wanna feel the worst fucking recoil EVER... play this game using that. You cannot fucking select any other firing mode as far as I know so its MEGA RECOIL with Burst Firing. 

Good fucking luck aiming and killing consistently with that.
Best course of action when going loud is to get your pistol and headshot. 

DO ANYTHING ELSE = You'll wanna kill yourself in 2 minutes. I can't fucking believe this is so badly done. Absolution fixed that issue. Civillians died easily too as you'd expect when shooting them in the torso whenever going crazy because stealth got too annoying. 

I'm not even gonna continue ranting about how weird as hell 47's face looks. Not at all the one we know. And the way they talk about him too. Its like he's some abandoned psycho 25 year old guy who's looking to murder people.
I dont feel like an assassin AT ALL from this prologue. I feel like a psychopath. And thats me KNOWING the franchise. I can't even imagine what a newcommer would feel like trying this. Let alone how stiff he is when he walks and stands. Nobody walks like that. Nobody stands like that. 


Go play Blood Money. hell, even absolution. 
This piece of shit was crap when it was episodic and weird as fuck in its development. Its options menu is retarded and lackluster. So many of my options (4-5 of them) are greyed out because its apparently ONLY supported with Direct X12??? presumably.  Played tripple A games from 2017 and 2018 that doesn't have this issue.
Wtf developer.... 

And yeah. Its not really that different in terms of killing and such. Its a weak, beta version of Blood Money in my opinion. Feels super unfinished which is not a fucking surprise considering that this whole damn game was episodic.... As if they had NO fucking clue what to do during development so they just yoloed it and made this thing. 

God. 

And now to the big deal that just makes me utterly uninterested in progressing through this horrible introduction.
Hold control = X-ray vision. 

Are you actually fucking serious? Why not use a tech pad to get a radar scan of the building, or some topside down tech reading of everyone inside. Something REALISTIC and cool, gadget like like in Blood Money?

Nope. Fuck that. 47 can see through FUCKING walls now. How? why? WHY NOT! 

This is so retarded and weird and casual. Its lazy and silly and makes the character boring. He used to have cool gadgets with him. Which you'd expect being a super assassin. 
Why dumb him down? 

Jesus christ. Want a focus mode? FINE. have the screen lit up who's watching who and where they look and such. Thats FINE. 

But this X ray dogshit? That doesn't even register visual cones either? 
This intro and baseline mechanics introduced just magnifies how fucking lazy they were with this game. And I've no interested in progressing on to larger maps with fancy buildings and crap that'll be weird and episodic of nature as well, because its just more generic beta crap. 

I've had enough. I'm not gonna ruin my lasting positive impressions of the Hitman franchise after Blood Money by playing dogshit like this. 
This game was weird from day 1. And now that its complete and times has passed I'm glad I stayed away. 

Long live the old games that were actually authentic, cool, expansive and portrayed 47 as a cool assassin. 

Not this weird ass person he is in this game as far as I've seen.

I felt more like a terrible assassin than a good one. The shooting is pretty much an afterthough and if you use weapons in the game it is designed to punish you like crazy! I wish the game was more like splinter cell where you actually have a gun that you can use. There is too much people in this game to do anything without being detected which sucks and the maps are too huge to be fun!"

With this game I finally realized it was the character animations. They are stiff and the transitions between people standing and running in fear look glitchy and unnatural. This would be a great series if they got a better character animator or did motion capture. But ultimately it just ends up feeling like low budget Playstation 2 era game to me. I feel like the people are expressionless puppets with pathing that is much too obvious.

In Absolution, we lost the more tactical game that Blood Money provided. Absolution was very cinematic, but I found it a little hard to adjust at first. This game goes back to the Blood Money style, so if you like that, then that's a positive.

However, this game was incredibly short. I completed it in about 8 hours, and that was taking my time. The AI don't seem to be very smart, the look and feel is nowhere near Absolution, and I found the progression system annoying. In order to play a contract on a harder difficulty or use various weapons or locations, you have to have already beaten the mission several times. I like my first playthrough to be the way I want to play, so I found that frustrating.

The ESP instinct felt way overpowered, as you could see your targets through walls from across the map. Granted, you can turn in completely off, but you can't turn it down.

A lot of the gameplay mechanics, like getting frisked, seem to be things that were added last minute. You can conceal weapons in trash cans to avoid them being dectected in a frisk, but, in my playthrough, I got frisked all of one time. A lot of mechanics feel this way where they go largely unutilized.

Unfortunantly, this game just makes me want to play Blood Money."

Episodic is weird too, but playing it after all the episodes are out it isn't as noticable, but I feel like I'm blowing through the campaign when compared to other Hitman games.

CONS: Gameplay is pretty repetitive, AI is dumb, Does not have a lot of replay value

GAMEPLAY:  You will find yourself getting bored of the gameplay.  It lacks the intricate skills required of other sandbox games like Metal Gear Solid or GTAV.  They market the game as having a lot of options for how to accomplish a mission but it all feels largely the same, or heavily curated by the game designers. You could choose to kill your target with poisoned drink, throw a wrench in the elevator, or you could strangle them - but all of these actions only require the press of a similar action button and require you to tediously navigate the level for a path ahead.  Its not fun or particularly fluid. Characters don't die in exciting and unique ways, but rather predictibly by always falling flat.  I remember other verisions of Hitman having more emergent gameplay which made it exciting.  This game lacks a soul in terms of gameplay.

AI:
The AI is crappy, and very predictable.  You can't really mess with the NPCs other than killing them.  They didn't put  a lot of though into crowd interactions or the breadth of how NPCs can change a game - other than to fill the space.  Also, all of the NPCs in the game have english accents regardless of what country your in.  This amounts to a Thai hotel security guard that sounds like Mr. Rogers from PBS.  Its really distracting and cheap.

Replay Value:  The game is ""peppered"" with different ways to do things, and new guns and objects to unlock for each level, but after a few tries at a mission, its not really worth playing again.  This is a function of the limited AI and heavily curated ways to conduct each mission.  There's not a lot of exciting possiblities that keep you coming back.

760,0,0.5417,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","As a Hitman fan, it's a relief to see the series return to form in terms of exploration. There are a few things keeping me from recommending it at its current price.

The price point at $60 is common for games with strong multiplayer function and blockbuster titles, like GTA V, CoD, and Battlefield (for some) but not Hitman. Many will be quick to rationalize the larger levels necessitate the minimum amount of levels (8), which is indeed the least in the Hitman series. However, the amount of opportunities in each level makes up for this shortcoming.

The always online aspect will also neuter your gaming experience if you so much as decide to play offline. No mastery starting locations, no freebie unlocks, no rewards. It's such a shame considering Contracts and Leaderboards are the only two reasons why one should need an internet connection, and Absolution found the perfect compromise in implementing this.

The current version of the game will crash if you play using DirectX 12 at random intervals. It doesn't just CTD, it's crash and I must reboot, since my keyboard and mouse somehow get disabled.

The story is weak, but it tries once again (like Blood Money, like Contracts, like Codename 47) to fill in the blanks of the prior games. The series achieves this by time skipping; first forward, then back, and forward again. Each cutscene occurs ""weeks earlier"" or ""weeks later"" and it happens so often that you begin to question the purpose of framing the storyline like this.

Now, let's discuss the good things, and why you should still try the game out.

Despite the episodic and online-only approach, which was probably pushed by Square Enix, you gotta give credit where its due for IO Interactive's response to series-long complaints. 

The AI, for the first time in the series, isn't telepathic. No longer will guards on the other side of the map know exactly what you look like in the span of two seconds. In other words, the civilians and guards alike act like humans and generally won't try to kill you unless you try to kill them. If you get caught doing a no-no, the person who saw you will identify you based on what you were wearing and what you did.

47's magical pockets from Absolution (letting you fit sniper rifles, and shotguns, and submachine guns, oh my) become just... deep pockets. If you play on normal difficulty, most objects you wield are no longer considered suspicious. This is very good, considering a carpenter using a nail gun shouldn't be considered a killable offense, just because you are bald.

Combat has vastly improved as well. Enemies will flank you with remarkable efficiency (also best in the series) and 47 will die in about 10 pistol shots. Earlier versions of the game give him even less health, forcing you to go stealth most of the time. While crowd cover, point shooting, and human shield abilities have been removed, evading enemy fire using cover remains effective, and you can easily elude danger by just running away. If they saw you, they'll remember what you look like, though."

Pros:
Voice acting

Cons:
*Everything besides voice acting. No one actually cared to put some entertaining and refreshing elements into this game. You have most likely already seen this kind of content in free shooters and puzzle games. You do not even plan hits in this game. It's just a puzzle to figure out. A real life hitman would probably feel out-of-place playing this game.

*Bad performance in every sense of the word. It wastes tons of resources only to produce mediocre results. I didn't even hear music in the game. I was supposed to listen to conversations, though they did not contain any information and were just excuses to get somewhere for a while and then go to a new place, repeat, pop and escape. It's like someone  hired their F-team to phone this game in and then put together an even worse G-team to quality-test the game. It has tons of bugs and the graphics glitch up pretty often.

*The low quality settings are a joke: the game looks much worse than The Witcher from 2007 and runs like garbage. Man, this stuff takes 17 gigs. You would think there would be a lot of great stuff, though the character models look worse than the ones in TF2.

*The controls are draggy and seem to be uplifted from some other genre game. Assassin's Creed? I cannot confirm as I do not play with crap. E.g. if I press up, the game moves where the character is looking towards or where the game feels like moving towards, not where I am looking at. These tank controls suck.

*Obstacle course game design. There is no incentive to do anything. It is all about ""we put these levels here for you, so play them and pay us"" fun-hating corporate game design.

*Laggy menus. What's the point of putting the game in the background if the menu still runs slow. It is like the menu makes the game run even slower. I don't think the developers knew how to use lightweight graphic objects and instead just spammed heavy-duty objects everywhere to produce the current unoptimized, laggy mess.

*Constant loading and state saving, even in menus and during the boot-up. Those pirates must be shaking with their DRM-disabled cracked copies that actually work unlike legal copies once someone finally takes this game down. :D

*Always-online requirement in the true cancerous Ubisoft-like design. Guess what that adds? MORE. LOADING. Sweet. It's like the infernal mobile app experience plague ported to PCs. Yay. Welcome back to the terrible user experience of the 1990s.

*Hitman in name only. At least in the first game, you got your money from your hits. Here it just a waiting- and time-based puzzle game, with unrealistically conveniently-placed openings to shove down people to their death and huge boxes or drawers in otherwise lightly-equipped rooms to hide the corpses of that room or the guy patrolling the corridor close to it. For example, in a tutorial mission, there was a massive closet inside a TOILET and pretty much nothing else.

*Obvious memory leak issues. Every consecutive time I load a saved game, the game runs progressively laggier.

*No originality. The game adds no significant gameplay elements that weren't already there in Blood Money in 2006 when the series was not yet milked to death. Steal clothes, pop the targets in the head, go for the big red button. It feels eerily similar to the Hitman 2000 demo. Square Enix spent 18 years only to create less than nothing. Now the old suit disappears upon cloth-changing and cannot be found by enemies unlike in the original game. In other words, it is a blatant ""clear suspicion bar"" move. The old suits simply get deleted. That is some lazy hitman work.

*Worthless, me-too-motivated cutscenes that provide zero character development. Ooh, I am a blank slate professional killer. That is almost as deep as the TITLE OF THE FRANCHISE.

*Etc. ( I am not paid to write more, yet have have already demonstrated more care for this game than the seniority-based Square Enix exec hired to oversee it i.e. to resist all of the good ideas and to enforce a strict minimum quota for mediocrity.  )"

the tutorial level had one target, and was very easy, given that it was a tutorial. the next level was an extension of the tutorial, which also had only one target. the first real level had two targets. by the time I took one out, I had almost no way left to take out the other, and had to shoot them in broad daylight. I thought to myself ""okay, that's probably just a one time thing. the rest of the levels will surely only have a single target."" boy, was I wrong!

the next level had THREE targets. I decided to use poison for the first one, since it was listed under challenges. I completed that oppertunity, and moved on to the next target. it appears I only had a single way of reaching this target at this point, since another opertunity had become unavalible. I took care of that target, and decided to move onto the third, already growing weary of this map. that's when I found out, my first target was still alive. turns out, the only way to get lethal poison was to do a repeat playthrough of the level. that made me wonder, why in the world was it listed as an avalible challenge then?

SUMMERY

overall, I was promised a sandbox to take out my target anyway I want, and that is not what I got. the in-game time constraints means more then one target is too much, which is what you get all too often. the game also tells you ways to take out a target that are impossible to complete until you complete them using a much narrower selection of ways; without even telling you it's impossible.

if they gave us a single target per level, more ways to take them out on the first play through, and did not tell us about methods we can't use yet, I would have easily recommended this game."

This will be the final amendment to this review.
Servers eventually went back up and I was able to finally play the game. Now if you are considering on buying this product in 2018 moving forward, here is what you are getting:
GOOD
- a great Hitman game with six huge locations littered with content that would give you hundreds of hours of gameplay.
- thousands of custom contracts that already add to the replayability of the game.
BAD
- Frequent connection issues to IOI servers.
- Locked out content when said servers go down.
- The pros of the game are lost when you can't connect to the servers.
- Elusive Targets that don't reappear (except for special events) which keeps anyone who bought this game too late from getting extra suits (not a huge deal really)
- Eventually IOI servers will be shutdown, which will eventually reduce the value of this game by 90%. Without servers, escalation contracts are gone, custom contracts are gone, which in turn leads to no sandbox contracts. This is specially annoying in Colorado, where you only have one EXIT in story mode, so the potential of the map is severely limited. Because of the nonesense always online feature, this game will eventually become unreplayable. In 10 years, if you want to load this up and make a roulette challenge that isn't bounded by story mode, you are limited in what you can do.
What IOI can do to remedy this is very simple: make a patch that would do the following:
- Make unlocks offline.
- Make escalations offline.
- Make an offline custom contracts, or atleast a way to disable story mode.
But IOI will not do this, they don't have to because once Hitman 2 comes out, season 2 for this game will never be released, support will stop and we will go around the same story for the sequel. Always online BS which limits gameplay, which in turn will make the game a shell of what it could be.
Conclusion: Do not buy this game now at FULL price, or at all, especially since you won't get the most of your money when IOI stops supporting this game when Hitman 2 comes out.
EDIT 2:
Steam denied my refund, so I decided to suck it up and give the game another try. If I could just finish one level where it won't take me ten years to load a save, I might just let this go, but after a fresh reinstall, I tweeked my internet settings as well, I booted up the game only to wait a whole 10 minutes to get to the main menu. When I did, I had to retry twice to load my save. And when I tried to reload after a mistake, another 5 minutes.

Asian servers are just bad. And there is obviously no support from IOI because no news about server maintenance or anything.

Again, don't bother buying this game if you are from this region, and don't buy anything from this developer because you are just throwing your money away.

EDIT 1:
After several days of server connection issues, I just gave up and requested a refund for this game. Despite having so many hours on the game, Steam doesn't show the time I spent waiting on the ""connecting"" window, which would amount to a couple hours in total, because I would play several rounds of Team Fortress 2 while waiting for it to just connect..

So I'm speaking with my wallet here. I'm not supporting a game developer that has a terrible way of handling their games.
- - -
I bought the game a few days ago and was enjoying it including the online content, and I was in the middle of an escalation when the game just went boop. So I started some troubleshooting and restarted Steam, Internet Connection...etc. But then when I loaded up the game, it would be stuck in loading/fetching limbo and I couldn't access any part of the game at all. After 2 days, I managed to load up a menu, but every time I open up my saves, or browse a contract, or just simply check on the Career tabs, the game disconnects and a prompt to retry pops up.

I know it isn't my internet because every thing else connects except for this game.

This is just annoying because the only reason I didn't touch this game for two years is because of all the nonesense with the online features and I wasn't paying full price for a game that locked content for no good reason, and I had hoped things would be patched up by now. Sadly, I was wrong, and having to ""reconnect"" everytime I load up a menu is seriously frustrating.

Now don't get me wrong, this is a great game ruined by a terrible online policy that does not make sense for a single player experience. Unlocks should be unlocked offline, Escalations should be playable offline, Challenges should be offline. Unless IOI servers don't crash for days on end, nothing except Contracts should be online.

Don't buy this game full price, don't buy the sequel for full price (or at all) if these practices continue."

Performance: The game looks great, but it suffers minor frame drops to about 40FPS when dozens of characters are on screen at once. I have a 1080TI and i7 7700k. The Sapienza mission is especially stunning.

Gamplay: It's brilliant, there are so many options to complete missions. It's a euphoric experience to complete a level with perfect stealth. The AI is a challenge. Replay value is very strong. Players can create their own missions within the levels too like in HItman Absolution. It controls very well.

The Fatal Flaw: Hitman is always online. You can play offline, but you will be playing a severely gimped experience. Alright, so you can't play Hitman in a quality state on a plane. So what? Like most online games, the servers will be shut down eventually and Hitman 2 is coming out in November. I strongly believe the developer will shut down HItman's servers leaving the game in a serverely poor state. For that reason, I see no reason to purchase this game. The sequel seems like this game, but expanded on. It won't be episodic and it's unlikely for it to be always online. 

Visuals: 9/10
Gameplay 10/10

811,0,0.7904,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I'll just give reasons why I stopped playing after 16 hours spent in the game.

- Visual design. Though the locations and models look and act realistic, the overall style is lacking. The world (the surroundings, what npc's talk about and do, etc.) looks kind of too simple, even boring. Nothing stands out, nothing catches the eye. The previous game had somewhat exaggerated and even a little cartoony style, but it was very definite and it made me remember it.

- I never particularly liked being in the skin of a bald, coldblooded assassin, but when he is out of focus, so to speak, and more of a projectable rather than a relatable character I would prefer to have character creation and customization. And this is something I've been waiting for the developers to add a long time ago - ""Make your own Mr. (Ms.) 47"".

- Exploration, messing around with the levels, looking for ways to kill the target and other things that I liked doing on my own in previous games are now build into achievement and 'leveling-up' system, which it was in the previous game but it didn't feel so forced (e.g. I can't get a better scope for my rifle until I kill some character in a particular way. I don't want to do it just now. I just want the scope.) The game trailer says, ""experiment, explore"", but it forgets to add, ""We've made it certain that you'll do it the way we intended.""

- The story. After every mission there's a short cut scene involving characters I don't know (and don't care about), which end with a 'cliffhanger'. For me, there was no story. The first game held my attention just by being unique. The second game is a revenge story. The third one reused some levels from previous games but definitely had a story. The fourth and the fifth games are probably the most memorable to me. This game, I have no idea what it's about."

I remember when people were joking about gaming companies selling their games in kits in the form of DLCs.
But that's exaclty what they did.
When they offered the ""game"" for free on steam, I was very surprised. How nice of them to offer the game so we could play it and maybe buy the extra DLC to thank them for giving us an average to good assassination game.
Although I was completely wrong.
In the last event where they gave the gave for free.  They were actually giving us demos, as you need to still buy each independent episodes for full price.
I can buy the Game of The Year for 60 bucks. So nothing is free at all."

The graphics, the sounds, the voice acting and the story are all amazing but the game is too simple, and placing ""challenges""/achievements is not the way to fix this.

This is the way to play Hitman:

1 - Press F1
2 - Choose an opportunity and press track
3 - Follow the track icon in your face
4 - Profit! Kill all your targets like this with great score

In my opinion, to make the game great remove the ""opportunities"" or at least make them something you find by ""accident"", less tracking also, it is actually ridiculous to simply start a mission and have a full list of ""opportunities"" for you to track, i want to find the ""opportunities"" myself.

I wish i could recommend this game, because Hitman story is awesome.

The game also had random freezing, which then led to a crash. When the game crashed, it would not close no matter if I tried ending the process in task manager. After it wouldn't close, I had to restart my computer. During the restart my computer got a blue screen error due to the game not closing despite me efforts.

The game itself, first and second episodes were released free for a short time, sepratedly. Kudos to IO Interactive. Very glad of you.

Open world (kinda..)


Many possibilities of how to eliminate your target or plannings. Of course, it's hitman game and thats what makes it great.

The world maps are very rich made. 

Removed Denuvo. I'm very pleased that IO Interactive removed Denuvo after they bought Hitman IP rights from greedy Squeenix. And for that, I'm giving this review Recommended. Just for that.


CONS:


Episodes are expensive.. This is why I hate episodic games.

The character models look downright ugly. I don't know how to explain it but character models are so unnatural like agent 47 for example. Absolution character models look OK.

Unoptimized mess

Online-only huh... On a singleplayer game.

More to write soon


In the meantime, 7/10 for the game 
[strike]0/10 for developers for being pile of shit and sell our data. THAT'S why this was free
I bought the whole episodes now"
845,0,0.5488,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Pros: It's Blood Money with Absolution's amazing mechanics (kinda). 

Cons:
Wonky physics
Minor bugs that seem counter intuitive (such as failing an escalation due to being spotted by the target which head is being rapidly approaced by a meat cleaver)
The loadout system (is it too hard and/or realistic to smuggle in coins in addition to your poisons/guns/fiber wire etc?)
The whole elusive target system (mainly that you have to wait so long for them)
A little on the easy side (ESPECIALLY when it comes to distracting/stealth + the stupidity of the AI)

Overall a very positive experience, I do recommend it if you enjoyed Blood Money and Absolution's mechanics, 8/10

Why is this a negative review? You might as well wait for Season 2 coming out."
846,0,0.5147,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I picked this game up for the enhancements that I could play in Hitman 2. I have much more time with this set of missions in that game, so the low play time here is mostly from free weekends and give away missions. I did not particularly care for this version of Hitman, despite a lot of praise being thrown around for it. The game feels really overly-scripted and hollow compared to what I will call the 'active stealth' of its predecessors. I sat around waiting to complete one of the mission objectives for what felt like 10 minutes. That's a long time to be sitting there, just waiting for the AI to finish gallivanting around so that I could push a button for a scripted event. The levels are really huge, but that's not a good thing - it just seems to have led to massive, senseless bloat. Like many games, I have to wonder if this aspect of Hitman was ruined because the developers decided to make some grand story play out instead of focusing on tight gameplay like the previous titles. I really don't care about some kind of grand story in a game series about a contract killer. Also, the always online component for unlocks is unnecessary and draconian. It really ended up tanking my performance by adding all the extra server connection time to update my progress with the game servers, defeating many of the advantages I've enjoyed for years now with SSDs more or less eliminating level load time.

I regret picking this game and the sequel up, even though I paid less than $20 for both. It's still money wasted on games that pain me to play.

Second try update: I've completed nearly all of the missions in this season and replayed one of the missions multiple times, as it was intended by the developers. This set of missions/maps is just terrible, regardless of enhancements in Hitman 2 or not. The experience has been completely sterilized. It's like they tried to make Hitman into Assassin's Creed with all the set pieces and over-reliance on scripted events."

850,0,0.6567,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I forced myself to continue assuming it would get better. But this is one of the most disappointing games I've ever played. It feels chintzy and over designed at the same time.

The AI remains as dumb as ever. The FOV is probably less than 70 and you can't change. The mouse speed even at its highest is ponderously slow. (Edit: Recently beat this on another launcher with different specs, and it still has all these same issues. It's not a hardware issue.) 

You can't jump, vault small obstacles, or climb unless specifically prompted (stop doing this, developers). There are invisible walls & arbitrary blockages randomly thrown around. Then to complicate matters, there's conveniently accessible ledges other places just to confuse you as to what your platforming capabilities actually entail. 47 runs like an old lady, the hand-to-hand fights are surprisingly lame and trap you into QTEs, and the x-ray vision feature is laughably out of place. I'm guessing the devs saw old Batman and Deus Ex games and just thought they would borrow the thermal-vision fad even if it makes no sense. The design feels ten years out of date. But refuse to use it and you'll be aimlessly searching for the target for half an hour.

Everything about this game feels contrived and hamfisted compared to other games. The environment feels lifeless. In other games when you shoot someone you can't take their clothes as they are soaked in blood, a punishment for playing sloppy.  When you run into people the pedestrians don't even respond or move accordingly to your momentum. Hell, Vice City had that figured out in 2002. In GTA IV, you could bump people and knock cigarettes out of people's mouths and pick them up and throw them at the owner, starting a small riot to distract nearby cops. In Sleeping Dogs, you could knock items out of strangers' hands and use them as weapons, not to mention dozens of organic contextual kills possible throughout the map instead of stagey-looking setpieces. Remember in The Saboteur when you could plant bombs on a car, crash it into a guard post, wait until a crowd formed and then detonate it, killing survivors with the falling debris, as you slipped away quietly? Neither does Hitman. Truth is, this is one of the least interesting assassin games I've ever played. Hitman fails precisely because it is trying to compete with better open-world games with actual freedom. When Gamespot calls this ""brilliant"" you might reasonably confuse it for sarcasm. 

The weird thing is that the developers designed the game to force a cautious, experimental, and patient playing style. There really is nothing ""emergent""--a term the same journalists who love this game like to throw around--about the gameplay when all the cinematic assassination methods are rigidly scripted, requiring no imagination on your part. They're designed to look cool, but are placed there for you to find, not for you to improvise. If Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is the Maserati of strategic combat, Hitman is more like the short bus. You replay the same mission countless times, rehearsing it until you pull off the perfect hit, getting all the pointless achievements in six measly locales you can beat in under 8 hours. But the enemy AI is so inconsistent, and disguises so dodgy a bet, it is often more fun to break the game's rules and just recklessly speedrun a mission, racking up big body counts John Wick style, moving onto the next map. Because you will get sick of replaying these maps pretty quickly."

Besides being a sandbox Hitman game which you can alert the difficulty at any time. 
It is impossible to get 100% completion as either challenges are made react (not doable anymore) or exclusive target mode where for limited times (if you buy the game now you've missed out of 99% of these targerts) a target was made availabe and if you died,pc crash/restart you lost the target and are unable to unlock the rewards offered. For Challenges I spent most of my time youtubing them as they are a grind to do or hardly very little details.

There seems to be no way to play this without looking up a walkthrough on the internet or using opportunities (which are essentially in-game walkthroughs). The missions are so ridiculously hard that there's no point in trying anything on your own. For a game marketed as ""sandbox"" the game is very quick to punish you if you ever try something out.

Some of the challenges are desiged really poorly. The ""Sharp Shooter"" gives you ca. 10000 mastery points (together with Master Sniper completion) but requires one rifle that can be only be obtained by maxing out mastery points on that map. In other words, the mastery points for that mission are completely pointless.

Same goes for escalations. The ""No-Save"" rule and the unfair conditions create one of the most boring and repetitive gameplays one can imagine."
885,0,0.7366,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","How to start on this? The game was prized by many and ain´t a bad game in a broader perspective. So I have to go against an army of fanboys. Still I frown upon it, since I do not think it´s a good Hitman game (in my opinion).

Why that? Well the puzzles(how you can take out your targets) are nice and creative. But the gunplay is just plain BS. You shoot someone in the head with a random pistol and that damn NPC survives. That is just stupid and makes no sense in and out universe. A headshot is a lethal takedown or the game is shit. I´m fine with troops wearing special helmets to circumvent this, but here this it not the case. No matter if it´s a guard or a civillian, a headshot from 50m away is like shooting with a paintball gun. They fall down and get back up - WTF?! You´re better of throwing sharp melee stuff. What a joke!
In addition to this Agent 47 can soak up bullets like a mega sponge - regenarate health like in fuccboi games. What a big fuccing ton of garbage. This is a complete joke. Was this game developed for degenerated console casuals?
To complete the stupidness 47 can´t handle a gun. He sprays harder than a rookie. Even short controled bursts are useless. 47 is more than a regular human beeing in terms of combat. He is a master of every gun - he was literally made for this. So I expect and demand superior control over every gun that he wields. This game seems to be made by people who never played a hitman game...

See - the Hitman series were never a FPS. The best ranking is in almost all cases archieved without any gunfire. But when things escalated the gunfight was lethal and unforgiving but with a bit of skill and tactic you could go rambo. I like to play my missions without saving. So when I mess up I have to face the consequences, loose my chance of a SA rating and have to blast through it or die trying. Rinse and repeat until I´ve mastered it. This game messes up what I always liked about the Hitman francise. 
Also there is no customization of your arsenal or stuff you can buy whith money earned. I could have overlooked this but since I´m unsatified I toss that in, too.

All in all a good puzzle game but a disgrace for the Hitman francise(imho)."

The plot is a bit ridiculous and there doesn't seem to be any progression in it. The original Hitman game (and even the couple after it) had a lot more soul. Here it's just: ""here's the mission list, pick any and repeat it many many times so as to gain XP and level up"" (who the hell had the idea to turn Hitman into some kind of RPG ffs :s).
You also have way too much assistance in the missions. I guess it makes them a lot less frustrating (unlike the original Hitman games, it's really easy to find out good action paths without using a guide), but this also completely breaks the immersion.

It's graphically beautiful, has some really nice mechanics, lots of diversity on how to play a mission, the challenges and unlocks add more replayablity, easter eggs are fun, and overall it's a good game to just mess about on too. I have no issues whatsoever with the base game at all.

HOWEVER

The devs are a little bit greedy. I know that from having this game on the Xbox One, you can buy all of the missions separately; albeit for a higher price than all of them bundled together, the option is still there. This is apparently not the case on Steam. In order for me to just play say one of the missions I really enjoy, I'd have to fork out between £35 - £50 to unlock them all. Maybe I don't want to unlock them all, but yet, if I am to fully enjoy this game, I have to pay the price. I liked the system on Xbox where you could just individually buy missions. It meant that I could buy them whenever I had money and play when I wanted. But with this, I feel as if I've got a gun held to my head as I'm deciding whether it is worth getting any more missions on Steam seeing as it's quite a hefty price. Yes I know, this is a triple-a game, yes I know this will obviously have a large price tag along with it because of this. However, this game had a different approach to how you accessed its content which at first confused me a bit, but now I actually quite like it. And to offer this service on one platform but remove it from another baffles me. It has obviously worked on console being able to sell the missions separately, I know this cos I bought the missions separately and it was a much easier way to go about things.

Overall, this is an excellent game, it's very enjoyable, but I am disappointed at the inability to purchase missions separately meaning currently I am not able to access the rest of its content. Therefore, I'm going to have to give this a thumbs down."

The online DRM is nonense, this game is entirely single player. The online aspect is included only to discourage piracy. My internet connection basically never goes down, but Hitmans servers do, sometimes at the worst of times or for no reason at all. 

When this happens all progress is lost, and the game kicks me out. This is a single player game, they're ruining the experince in the hope some pirate will be forced to buy it. The game does have a solid autosave and manual save system which helps, but I still don't like this. 

Gameplay wise, the game is great, it's a return to the open ended style of the older Pre-absolution games.. Blood money namely, where there is a focus on non-linear creative assasinations. 

Pros:Graphics are good, not ground breaking but they work. 
Enviroments are well designed,very detailed and ""lived in"" and the amount of NPCs in some of the levels is very impressive. 

Each level has many many ways to solve it, and there's always a way to get out of trouble if you haven't gotten yourself into truly unrecoverble situations. The ways vary from straight up murder with a sniper rifle, pistol or any number of direct assault methods, to more elebatorate accidents. Among other things. Unlike Absolution you will die if you try and shoot your way out, gun fights are dangerous. 

The AI is, accetable. They will work together and are fairly observant compared to some stealth games, but as always they are easily defeatable when you learn the patterns. 


Cons: The voice acting has almost zero vartiation. The Asian guards in Thailand sound like some Marines from America. This is a small thing, but for some reason it is noticable to me because of the detail of the enviroemtns, it sticks out as odd. They could do with some accents and variation. 

Online DRM, it is useless, locks you out of content if you happen to want to play online and is a failure point for the game when the publishers decide to drop it. It is a terrible practice that needs to be shamed out of existence.

The game doesn't run very well. I have aging but still competent hardware and while it's accetable it runs fairly poorly with frequent frame dips. It is playable for me on near max settings, but it could be better, and the sheer amount of NPCs rendered makes up for that slightly. 

The music is average, it just seems there to fill the silence, rather than to add to the game atmosphere for the most part. It's alright, generic. That's fairly subjective though. 

I have enjoyed my time with the game, the gameplay is good, and unlike Absolution, it's a good Hitman game, but I don't suggest buying it for these reasons unless you're really commited to the Hitman franchise. If you do buy it, make sure to be ok with always online.

base game was fun but the new dlc is a complete rip off and when it was first realsed you had to buy goty if you wanted to play it so wannting a refund after 10mins in the dlc goodluck as steam dosnt see you had the normal version of the game and they made the new dlc only obtainably through goty. there is 1 maybe 2 new maps the sinping mission is easy and if you want leader boards just save at the begain and then try to get your target as fast as you can save shoot everything until next target is hit then reload last save hit the target you just found and rinse and repeat no joke got top 15 by doing that sadly."

1. Always online requirement + you can't use items that were unlocked offline

955,0,0.75,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","It's not so much an action game as a puzzle game.  Hitman is based around scenarios and then completing them while performing certain objectives, the ultimate goal, ""kill the target"" isn't really the challenge.  The challenge comes from the increasingly tricky and nefarious ways to do so.

Hitman is much more of a sandbox game, the goals of killing in unusual manners revolve frequently around your ability to take on new disguises.  The elements of stealth aren't as much as hiding and creeping, as they are of seizing opportunity and hiding ""in plain sight.""  It's not the kind of stealth game where someone will spot you across a map, but rather spot you if you are someplace you shouldn't be.  As such I found it to be much more forgiving and sensical than other stealth games.  You won't be frustrated over someone spotting you through a wall or in a shadow at a hundred paces.

Ultimately, rather than the gameplay being driven by a narrative or play loop, it's driven largely by the player who is given a lot of freedom and encouragement to break systems and experiment.  As a result, it's a single player game that asks you to replay areas again and again, learning movements and moments in great detail, and to do so again and again and to manipulate the environment to encourage the same end goal (kill target ""x"") through wildly different means.

It can feel like purgatory at times.

If you're the sort of person who likes to sit down with a puzzle and isn't afraid of revisiting it again and again looking to beat your own time or score, then Hitman is a brain teaser worthy of dozens of hours.  Those looking for a linear action game can move on."

 I don't like that fact that if you want to unlock cool/efficient items that will allow you to properly do custom contracts or simply have fun, you must repeat the same mission with the sames targets over and over, not necessarily judged by your efficiency, but just by how many pre-chosen paths/solutions were used, and I'm not having fun figuring these out. I think Blood Money had a greater system.

Also too much of the stealth aspect consists on glitching your way through the AI, by which I mean throwing a coin from around the corner in an empty room with a guard, so he can turn his back from his only task and mindlessly walk up to it so you can sneak. I don't like that.

If you don't have it, get the GOTY version, sure. I personally already paid more for a promised full game when it wasn't even fully released yet to support it, and now they **** me over by tricking me into paying even more for very few content at an expensive price. F You."

1) Time. The online-only requirement has been unreliable in the past and will be disconnected some time in the future. So it is not just the ""elusive targets"" that are subject to limited gameplay duration. Moreover several times (such as the lighting and shadow updates with Marrakesh) during Season One the *new features/improvements* introduced horrible bugs that the community had to track down and provide solutions for the developers to implement. The players were used as Quality Control. So, the time-sensitive content ensured the worst possible experience for dedicated players. Anyone purchasing the GOTY version now has (i assume) missed all the ""elusive targets"" and are paying money for the rewards without the opportunity for the gameplay included in those elusive targets - so pay to not play.
2) Trend. The corporate decision to charge extra for ""bonus content"" even for customers who purchased the season pass in advance. I'm not upset that they're asking $25 for DLC that reuses existing maps for *new* missions. I am concerned by the clear corporate decision to charge as much as they think they can get away with for whatever they think fans will buy; at the expense of their reputation. They can't be trusted to deliver on a Season Two Season Pass, and the ""outfit bundle"" clearly indicates that item (outfits/items/weapons/etc) microtransactions will be coming soon."

Yes the game is way better than Absolution. You have more freedom and more ways to eliminate your target and overall it is a great game BUT the game isn't optimized well and does not look good. Seriously Absolution (2012) looked better than this. The real Problem with this game is/was the marketing and content. That episodic cancer and this terrible Elusive Targets. Elusive Targets itself is a neat idea IF it wasn't timed exclusive. Once you missed it it is gone with the unlockable outfits especially the old outfits from Blood Money and Contracts otherwise if you bought the ""FuLl eXpErieNcE"" you missed your chance, they punish everyone who wanted to wait for the full release. But don't worry they are bringing them back in November along with the ""GOTY"" version BUT if you already failed a elusive target before you are not allowed to try again because...

When i heard they went seperate way with Square Enix, i got my hopes up thinking the devs will remove the absurd features that Square Enix forced (ex. ALWAYS ONLINE IN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME) but rather than that they try to sell 4 reskinned maps for 20$ in the name of GOTY Edition.

Pros:
+Great Graphics.
+Sandbox
+Replay value

-6 maps (rest is just a reskin)
-Meh. AI
-Guards can shoot through people
-ALWAYS ONLINE

1015,0,0.7726,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","If you like replaying the same six missions, then, I suppose, this game is for you. Other than that, HITMAN doesn't bring a lot to the table.

Whats good:
-It's a very visualling stunning game. It's absolute beautiful.
-For the six maps (or 7 if you count a shift daylight to be a seperate map) are detailed and, in classic Hitman fashion, allow missions to be completed in a number of ways.
-There's more whimsical gadgets/items, like explosive rubber duckies.
-Addition of mini map is helpful for close quaters.

Whats not:
-The AI. I believe this is the first Hitman game to feature international missions and everyone has either an American or British accent. Every Hitman game has had proper accents on the NPCs, except this one. The AI doesn't react to the sight of blood stains, and their reaction to 47 is laughable. You can stand 20 meter away with a gun held out and it will take the AI 3-5 seconds to react.
- Agent 47 now has super powers. Instead of giving us a map to look at (circa Hitman 1, Contracts, Silent Assasin, Blood Money), Agent 47 can now look through walls. Just because other games like Farcry and Assasins Creed has this mechanic, doesn't mean that Hitman should. In my opinion, it severely dumbs down any strategy in this game. Also, Agent 47 can throw a mutlitude of items as if they're magnetized to peoples' heads. I've thrown a hammer at someone around a corner, and yet it still hits them.
-6 missions. For a $60 game, you get six missions. 
-They're trying to cash in using the Blood Money name with their brand new DLC that adds a suit, a chrome gun, and a white duck...

Unless you're a completionist, I don't see any way someone gets the advertised ""100+ hoursof gameplay will challenge the creativity of all assassins"". Yes, it is a very beautiful game, however, the fact the AI quality has reverted back to the likes of Hitman: Codename 47 ( a game that came out in 2000!) is shameful. 
In my opinion, to improve the game: get rid of the seeing-through-walls and bring back the map screen, rework Agent 47's throwing mechanic, drastically improve the AI's responsiveness, and add two more missions."

1017,0,0.8259,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","This is my first HITMAN game ever and I got to say I'm really disappointed. The mood and graphics are brilliant, but otherwise the gameplay is bland.

My main problems are the AI, scoreboard and absence of difficulty levels. This game promises large open sandboxes and that is somewhat what you get, but all the ways to assasinate the targets are predetermined by the developers and it is up to you if you want to find all the opportunities and if you enjoy executing them.

For me having direct paths on how you should approach the target is just plain boring and there is no difficulty doing so with AI that spots you only after about 3 full seconds before getting suspicious. That is plain casual gaming in practice if you ask me. 

In Paris level I went unauthorized to a closet as many times I liked, even though there was a guard looking directly at me about 10 meters away. No distraction was required. I killed the second target who had a bodyguard following her in a bathroom, when before the kill the target and her guard were in the next room: I opened the bathroom door, which they saw, threw a coin on the bathroom floor and the target came in to investigate. Then I visibly closed the door from the guard and killed the lady. A moment after that the guard came in to follow and I easily dealt with him. Why the guard didn't follow her into the bathroom instantly? Why the target investigates suspicious threats and not the guard? I also dropped a gun into a trash bin before this when there was a guard staring at me like 7 or 8 meters away with no one else in the room watch for.

After every level you get a score, but how it's constructed is very limited. Everything is just about not being detected and not killing innocents and that's basically it. Nothing about how you did it or anything that supports self-reliant creativity or challenge.

Lastly I'd like to mention that wherever you are on the globe in this game, every person speaks fluent American English, which is really off putting if you like to breathe in the atmosphere. The decision not to use local language and English subtitles is far beyond me.

In the end this game has pretty much nothing going for it other than just exploring the levels to find new ways to kill the targets and then tediously executing those - yay. I got to stress that incompetent AI in a stealthy assasination game is a huge bummer. Don't buy this game!"

1021,0,0.446,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","What I always liked about the Hitman games was that the developers tried out new things in every new release. Some worked out well, some didn't, and I think often times whats good or bad is a matter of personal taste. Nearly every title had some flaws for my taste (the one with the least amount for me was ""Blood Money""), but I always liked and recommended them.

This one is different. Although the levels are beautiful designed, the missions are diverse and the voice work is fine as always (exception below), there are some really annoying flaws that prevent me from giving a thumbs up, and, since thumb sideways is still not an option, i have to go for the negative one.

- The ""always online"" function is bu*****t, at least for the SP mode. I get that there are people who want to compete with others around the world and upload their personal records and create and share challenges. I am not one of them, but I‘m fine with that. These are MP functions and can be handled separately like in countless other games. But why the hell are my personal level statistics only saved as long as I play online? I played the game roughly ten hours before the first ""can not connect to server"" message came, so it asked me if I wanted to continue offline. So, the savegame becomes an offline one and i won‘t be able to upload my statistics for competition, fine. Don‘t care. But this is a g****mn single player game, one where my character gains experience based on my performance! That means an offline SP can not unlock more items to make new playthroughs interesting. You may start a level in online, but as soon as you switch to offline it erases all score and data you collected in this level. Thats a no-go, and don‘t tell me that it‘s a technical problem to store my level data offline or something.

- All unlocking functions of items and weapons are tied to this levelling system. So, if you want to play and gain more stuff for future playthroughs, you have to see that the server is online. If it‘s not, you‘re out of luck. Which also means that if the developer closes down sometime in the future (a thing that sadly happens from time to time) the game is gone for everybody. 

- Statistics are massivly reduced compared to earlier games. Just the numbers for target kills, innocent kills, being seen and time are given. No detailed listing of weapon use, cause of death, etc. Sad! 

- One storytelling thing that bothers me is that no matter where you eavesdrop, be it on servants in Bangkok, streetfolk in Italy, Marrakesh or Paris they all talk in perfect american or british english.
Why? They used native speakers in the previous games. I get that you need to understand the dialogues. Make 47 understand every language and give subtitles! This game is already over the top, but the exotic flair is part of the charme. If everyone sounds the same (and they use just a handful of actors that don‘t use any variation in their voices), it becomes dull.

- Some mission clue was misleading and made me search about 3 hours for a person at a specific place (""dongle"" in Sapienza), not giving me a clue to realize that this person had already left. A case of very bad mission design.

- The inventory system is worse than in previous games. You basically have a scroll wheel you have to open and scroll through for every single item (even lockpicks are not automatic anymore). No quick slots, no ""next item"" key, nothing. Very impractical. 

In conlusion I have to say it‘s not a bad game per se. 
It is actually quite good. But compared to the previous hitman games and their high standard, for me it is clearly a step down in quality."

The game itself is fantastic, but we the community need to communicate that the following issues are not acceptable and should be corrected, ESPECIALLY now that IOI is independent. 

1. Online Mode, and locking progression behind it. This needs to be removed. It just punishes the players and is a bad idea. If you want to collect AI pathing data, keep a log and upload when the game closes like steam sync.

2. Selling people the ""full season"" or ""full experience"" and then asking 20 bucks for lets be honest, what is not a lot of content for the price. Perhaps the initial blame lies on the publisher for marketing it that way, but you need to be straight and fair to us when selling additional content.

Rather than having a lot of short missions, they have very few, long missions. They do have interesting ways of killing people, but a lot of them are extermely linear: go to the icon on your screen, grab this item, go to the next lightbulb on your screen, etc. They set up a lot of these paths for you to choose from, but it becomes boring quickly. I've played a few missions twice, but didn't really enjoy them the second time. The missions are just way too long... I don't want to spend 2 hours killing one person.

Game started out great with Paris and Sapienza both being fantastic, but quickly went south. Marrakesh was mediocre, while Bangkok was just bad. Colorado sticks out for me as being one of the worst levels in the series, with horrible visuals, level design, and unbelievable decisions like 5 objectives and only one exit. Hokkaido was excellent, but for a 60 dollar game to have only 3 good levels is a joke. 

What I really want to bring up though is how IO Interactive has treated game balance. Fun things like the Lancer sniper being able to shoot through walls have been removed, while huge issues like not being able to choke on stairs are ignored. Bullet distractions and footsteps making noise were also removed (for no apparent reason), but retarded features like NPCs viewpoints being placed in their head (which randomly moves) is kept. I might understand why they would want to remove some features if they deemed them overpowered, but if that were the case, the ridiculously overpowered poison and explosion kills would be nerfed. Even then, who cares about some weapons being overpowered in a single player only game?

While I respect IO for monthly updates, these updates have started adding little to nothing such as weapon reskins, or fixing shit that shouldnt need to be fixed.  Speaking of weapons, with no weapon customization, almost 90% of guns are total shit. Only good pistols are silverballer and krugermeier, only good sniper is sieger and so on and so on. 

The icing on the crap cake though, is the total disregard of series classics. Jesper Kyd Soundtrack? Gone. Briefcase? Gone. Weapon Customization? Gone  Accents? Gone (enjoy hearing the same 4 voice actors speak the same way the entire game)

While I do think the game has the potential to be the best in the series and a fantastic game, it's clear that at the current rate it wont be taking that title any time soon.

My issues are with the gameplay. Basically you have to go through every mission by trial and error and spend a large amount of time just searching where the game expects you to go and/or just observe events play out without participating so you know what to do next time you play, a map would have been the least i expect.

In the mission Sapienza you come to a city where you have a safe house, however the game doesnt tell you where that save house is. Even in real life you could just get a map and directions, not here though. 

Then there is a random dectetive, as soon as you get spotted by this detective he becomes suspicious and starts hunting you, even though he is in a public area sleeping on a bench. You are expected to wake the detective up while he is sleeping and stay out of his line of sight so he receives a phonecall which you can then overhear.
This whole thing makes absolutely no sense and wouldnt even be remotely possible in reality. (i.e. you cant just accuse and arrest a random civilian just because he stands in front of you for half a second).

Then you can find a USB stick which is apparently carried by a guy who went to church. After finding the chuch (again there is no map because reasons..) naturally you have no idea who the guy carrying the USB stick actually is.

I've been playing Hitman games since 2002, with the release of 'Silent Assassin' and I have played through and beaten them all. Any game with a rating system for your missions, I would strive for dozens of hours to get the perfect and fastest Silent Assassin run one could get. This franchise stumbled heavily with Absolution, and cracked its skull on the pavement with this reboot. Where to begin?

The graphics, sound, voice acting, they are all absolutely fine. They got a very good VA to replace Diana, who sounds more like the original than the Absolution recast did. The level design is certainly a return to IO Interactive's clever origins. So if the game is graphically competant, the sound design is well implemented, and the voice acting is great, what is the issue?

I purchased this entire series for under $30, and for the amount of content, it was a somewhat justifiable purchase because I knew IO interactive was getting SOME of the money. IO Interactive is a great developer that has been held hostage by the horrible decisions of a corporate boardroom somewhere in Japan. I've yet to even finish the game, I feel it is just so over-developed in the levels and frankly boring. This was most likely done to try and justify purchasing individual levels. Some of the most memorable moments I've ever had in video games, nevermind in the Hitman franchise, were in levels developed by IO that were 1/20th the size of most HITMAN maps. Excess only succeeds if that excessiveness doesn't come at an excessive cost. I feel poor publishing decisions, anti-consumer practices, and bloated/artificial grind for particular play-styles ruins this. This is a great imitation of a Hitman game if marketed and published by a soulless, shifty demon. 

A) Episodic Content. You will never be able to convince me this is a good idea. See, I remember Gabe and Valve's promise of Episodic Content. 11 years later, it's the biggest elephant in the room. Selling a game piecemeal will never be a good business practice. Spending $60-80 on a game and not knowing if 90% of its content will be good in the future is a shady practice whether the content ends up good or not.

B) Because of episodic content being one level at a time, too much is packed into a single map.

C) All of the clever ways to eliminate people, all the combinations of weapon use and situational awareness- all the potentially hilarious scenarios and funny stories you can tell your mates about your original kill... They've all been listed as achievements you can easily see. Worse, you need to go around and meticulously do these things in order to unlock the weapons you'd like to use in the first place- so by the time you have your W2000 rifle, you are bored of the map. This is one of the worst changes to me. I will never understand the artificial pursuit of unlocking corporate-guidelined 'achievements.' and HITMAN has been built entirely around this psychological mindgame of rewarding you with XP or items for unoriginality. 

D) Always Online. Always connected to a corporate server. Anyone who thinks this is a good idea for a single player game needs to absolutely fuck off. Anyone who thinks building a single player game around constant micro-updates of content and DLC packs in a game already sold piecemeal is a corporate drone of the highest order. This entire game is the pure application of anti-consumerist practices. 

It's the same practices that killed Deus Ex: Mankind Divided- a self-immolating fireship of an idea to cut a game in half to sell later when the consumer-base knew it was done solely to boost profit during a time where they were already basking in a RECORD BREAKING FISCAL QUARTER. Instead of releasing a full game, they tried to fill it with DLC packs, Pre-Order packs, and split the game in half. As a result, most didn't buy it or pre-order and thusly they ended production of anymore Deus Ex. They shot themselves in the stomach and complained when they died of a gut wound. 

E) Too much item usage is locked behind problem C. This over-utilization of achievements locking gear/outfits instead of simply completing the level with a good rating stifles the flow of the game. I replayed Hitman 1, 2, Contracts, and Bloodmoney over and over again because it was immensely fun to do so, and to discover what the developers intended and did not intend in the levels. I feel, because of the reasons listed, this sense of discovery is now entirely artificial and fake. It's as if they built a strategy guide into the game. 


Square Enix, a Japanese Publisher, has been acquiring some of the greatest Western Franchises of all time and intentionally sabotaging them during a time of record-breaking profits in their Japanese games division. You, as a consumer, should not fiscally contribute to these practices."

There is no Human Shield feature in this game and they got rid of the marking and executing feature as well. Now I am ok with the instict modes marking and executing feature being taken out (made the game to easy) but the human shield feature I feel is essential in this type of game. Sure people may disagree but that is part of my playstyle and it gives further tactical opportunities. I do not care what the excuse is! this game should have had that feature! The game is really fun but I was expecting more. Sure the maps are large but I felt like the maps were already a decent size, and I am not on a mission to sight see im on a mission to kill my target. Why get rid of amazing gameplay features to add mapsize? I personally would have preferred more tactical manuevers such as the human shield or maybe some new manuevers rather then just more items to kill with and enviromental objects to interact with. I feel there was plenty of options already in that catagory in the previous games. Its not my place to say what manuevers should be added to the game but i feel that if one was added it should not be taken out unless it was ineffective or not realistic. Human Shield is essential for some of us. I understand it was not in the first game but hey there is a lot in this game that was not in the first game and back then they did not have the tools to do it effectivley. Now they do and they chose to take it out instead of improve it. Hate when devs do this in games because this tactic allows them to keep pumping out new games full price. They just take out something then re add it in the next game but take something else out to repeat the cycle."

-boring and basic missions compared to old games
-Everything is based on replaying the same mission over and over(who the fuck thought of that)
-You HAVE to play on easy mode until you play the same mission multiple times (wtf)

It's hitman bloodmoney reborn with some removed features. When devs went back to the roots i was expecting the good old menu to purchase equipment, attachments and intel. Instead we are greeted with silly progression unlocking that is literally forcing you to play the game differently everytime if you want little new gear or entry point. This is very unpleasant hastle for me personally.

With this new entry i was expecting more personality traits and waypoints for the AI's to create more immersive experience, but instead in these great looking levels we are greeted by mindless drones that repeat the exact same chores over and over again until you trigger enviromental effect that attracts the target to a secluded location like moth to a flame for that easy silent assassin score.

(It's technically a railshooter in open environment).

There is replayablity in these alternative missions that have you kill other people in the same levels. Escalation i think it was called and it's terrible for hardcore hitman players. On my first experience it was hellish time finding the target as there was no dossier to explain the character in question. Only by activating assist i was able to find out that well dressed target was some pointless bodyguard i wasted 30min looking for.

Then there is illusive targets that is hardcore mode that give you only 1 try to complete the mission without saves. It's easier then escalation as you actually get hints about the target. If you know the map from previous missions, you can use the ""railshooter"" feature to your advantage and lure the target easily to a trap. Played my first illusive target today and got best silent assassin ranking, as i knew the routines of the map from my play through from other missions.

Devs need to step up their game for season two, as focus on silly progression system to lenghten the games life span has left the innovation department completely underwhealming.

Hitman games live or die on their levels, and this entry has the most expansive and detailed levels yet.
They may even be too expansive, twice as many levels at half the size would still give plenty of different paths while significantly increasing variety.

Unfortunately its dragged down by the progression and always online model.
Unlocking gear, even playing on ""professional"" difficulty requires grinding the same level over and over again to earn experience points from challenges.
This means you can't use something as simple as a sniper rifle, triggered explosives, electronic lockpicks, or certain poisons until you've reached the right level by replaying missions over and over again.
Professional difficulty is the only right way to play a Hitman game, yet to unlock it here you need to play each level 10+ times. There's no way to play the real difficulty without wasting tens of hours grinding the same levels over and over. 

All of this progression is locked off in the offline version. Although you can use items you already unlocked, you can't earn any experience to unlock more without being online.
There isn't a single feature in this game which requires an always online connection. The few pieces of content which do require connecting to the internet could easily be designed to only connect when necessary (scoreboards and player made contracts).

As far as the game goes, I love it. The story is interesting enough and strings the missions together, and the sandbox levels are tons of fun. There is an attention to detail here rarely seen in other games. The challenge is fairly high, and you can't often brute force your way through problems. Still, the AI can have some funny behavior, and the HUD doesn't always reflect your actual alert status.

I cannot recommend this game, however. Several hours in, I bumped into a guard who said ""are you retarded or something?"" The term ""retard"" was fased out of the medical community years ago because of the negative connotations associated with the word. It is widely considered amongst disabled people to be a slur. This has been widely known and available information for decades. The devs at IOI apparently hate disabled people or somehing. I've since heard this dialogue again twice.

What it inadvertently brought to my attention was just how little time was spent on the guard speech. They use the same lines across every map, and none of the characters have the correct accents. Everyone in the first 3 episodes has an American accent, regardless of what country you are in. Then you get to the Colorado level, and they do a total cop-out. Instead of actually being about some sort of far-right militia compound in the mountains, it's a group of international super terrorists trying to invade America. Any opportunity to make a statement of substance is squandered in favor of a dull political thriller. The targets and soldiers don't all have American accents, which is super weird since this is the ONLY level in America. You'd think a detail as glaring as that wouldn't have made it to release, and you'd think someone would have said ""let's not have every npc use a slur when you do something wrong,"" but no.

I'm sympathetic to the fact that Square Enix forced a ship date on them, but including a slur in a modern video game is absolutely unacceptable.

Basically if you happen across an NPC that's looking down at a countertop chopping something up and you walk by in the same disguise from 5ft away behind a counter, there's a chance your cover will get insta-blown and you'll have to reload a save.

The levels are not at all reminiscent of Blood Money. If anything, they're more like Hitman 2, in the sense that they 100x the size they need to be. 80% of the map is useless as your targets will generally just patrol within a very small area, standing conveniently in the way of a few traps along the way. Every map repeats the same basic strategy of setting up a trap, usually just a chandelier or poisoning a drink, and waiting. 

Speaking of it NOT being like Blood Money at all, you can no longer shove people. Oh, and [b]accident kills will ruin your silent assassin rating[/b] because reasons. If you're totally undetected the whole level but your target's bodyguard died from the chandelier falling on them, no silent assassin. This basically railroads you into the ""opportunities"" which are just following linear checkpoints that tell you exactly what to do next. 

There's no mystery, there's no discovery, and don't you [b]dare[/b] try to think outside the box unless you want your cover blown because an NPC 30ft away turned his head to cough and saw you out of the corner of his eye.

This game is trash, and I say that as someone who doesn't care about always online DRM [i]and[/i] as someone who bought the ""full experience"" after the fact, meaning I didn't suffer from the episodic release. It's a bad Hitman game, it's a bad game, don't play it."

Hitman was Considered the most challenging Sniping/Stealth/Assasin Game of it's time.
Since Absolution, Hitman has become a sell out Franchise due to amount of cutsence, boring storyline, and Intel Voice in Your Ear (Telling You What You Need to Do next...)

The Graphics:
Environmets (Assassin's Creed Unity)

Crowd Density High (Better Than Absolution)

The Gameplay:

And still, it's hard to recommend the game to anyone.
The main problem is the complete absence of a story. We simply have 6-7 maps and numerous ways to eliminate the unfortunate victim. Personally, I find this approach very boring. In this regard, Absolution is far superior with its micro-missions.

Cons:
1. Bugs. I was going for 100% achievements, which meant restarting each mission several times. As a result, key and not-so-key characters simply stopped moving, apparently losing their script. The only way to fix it was to restart the mission.
2. Coins. In my opinion, a very stupid decision that makes the game 20 times easier. But without them, it is impossible to execute what was planned. What nonsense, why is everyone searching for coins? Whether it's a guard at an important post, a tourist, or even the target itself. It's too easy and unrealistic.
3. The most important thing for me, as I wrote above, is the lack of a story.

Pros:
1. Funny ways to kill.
2. Contracts are sometimes so hardcore that it's even interesting to play.

I don't know why everyone worships this part, Absolution is the true new Hitman in terms of presentation. I'm not even thinking about buying Season 2, it's identical to the first one."

tl;dr conclusion: Beautiful maps, mediocre Hitman game.

What I enjoyed most in other Hitman games was how each mission had this unique feeling. Maps each had places you had to explore to make sure you can plan and execute the kill. Finding rooms, figuring out how you could break the patterns, getting to isolate your target to dispose of it in sometimes gruesome and funny ways, or more subtle ones. In this one, it's simple: I beat EVERY - and I can't stress this enough - mission with the exact same thing. Find a bald guy the target has to meet, yet never saw before, go talk to the target, hence breaking his/her pattern, he/she takes me to an isolated place where I only have to press a button while he/she talks to me to get the kill, which won't be noticed ever as nobody else can/will come there. I found it funny the first time, but honestly, doing the same thing over 6 missions was painfully repetitive. It's like the game itself doesn't even care and taunts me about it, the 6th man whose identity I stole basically had surgery to look EXACTLY LIKE THE FIRST BALD GUY, he literally says it while having a phone conversation.

Repetition is key. And the big, beautiful, richly animated world that comes to life on these amazing big maps just makes it more obvious and sad. You literally get to travel ALL AROUND THE WORLD, yet you'll always be hunting for the same bald guy/items to complete it. There is nothing to remind you that each mission is different. And 50€ for a game I beat in 6 hours, while feeling how repetitive this short time was, is NOT good. Hell, I doubt I could even convince you to buy it for 20 bucks. I'm not even getting into how the episodic economic model shows how little SE cares about the customers, or how DRM is pushed down our throats while totally unecessary. 

""But wait! You have the escalation contracts! Or the community created contracts!""
I don't care. Hitman shouldn't be about community created stuff. I have nothing against mods, some games are DEFINITELY enhanced by mods or community made DLC. But not Hitman. Not with this price tag. When I pay SE 50€, I want a game THEY made. I want handcrafted missions that feel unique and get me to think about how to win and get the silent assassin rank. Not some stupid always online grind. 

""What about Elusive targets then?""
Do you mean the 20+ missions I've missed because I've been hesitating for quite some time before I bought the game? I like the concept, but it's basically a huge middle finger to all those who didn't support the bullshit preordering/day one buy. Plus I failed the first one I tried because as I spawned, guards came at me and killed me on the spot. Didn't have time to do shit, hope it's not a built-in feature, and still a bit salty I failed that because of some weird bug. But then I remember, I missed more than 20, so, eh, one more shouldn't be so bad.

Conclusion: The world is beautiful and alive, you can stop and listen to every NPC, the amount of dialogue written is pretty amazing but the unappropriate price-tag, bad and unjustified episodic release, uninspired gameplay and level design make for a lousy 6-to-8 hours tops grind.

PS: Notice how I didn't talk about how the story sucks? That's because there is no story told. Not that it mattered in previous games, but previous games were FUN."

Before I start, I would like to say that I enjoyed the game when it was being... Hitman.

A variety of ways to kill your targets. Through ""accidents"", through explosives, close quarters combat... There's a lot of ways you can take people out. The flexibility of the game is good sometimes.

However, when you fuck up, things will most definitely stay fucked. I know this is a hitman game. Your plans should be executed without error. You should not be making mistakes. But there should be some middle ground.


Also, the game isn't that well optimized. Played the tutorial mission fine. Paris, I had to drop my graphics and resolution to the lowest, and turn on an fps optimizer to get close to 60 fps. Crashed twice for me too.


One thing I didn't like was how the special events played out. For a Hitman game, the special events are essentially an easy way out. The game difficulty drops down and starts drooling on the floor when you find one.

I didn't quite finish it but somewhat enjotyed it so I bought the first installment of this one.

I generally like the game flow, the graphics is splendid, the settings are nice, the AI is more realistic (e.g. if you slip into a disguise, not every member of that group (e.g. ship stewarts) will recognize you as an outsider, as in real life not all stewarts would know all their colleagues, but e.g. the head stewart would).  There are also new ways of distracting them by letting weapons lie around in the open.

However, there is one thing that drives me mad, and that is the voice over of the AI.  They all have some kind of southern brawl and speak stupid pseudo military sentences, which completely kill the immersion. E.g. in the first installment (the fashion show), you throw a nickel as distraction, the bored french secuirty guard hears it, takes his radio and in some southern/western accent says ""Hearing something. Examining possible source of disturbance"" and then just walks 10 steps to pick up the coin.

It's possible that this is some kind of a ""Well, it's Hitman, it's always been like this."" thing, but not for me.  Without this, I would give the game 9/10 but it's driving me mad in no time, so I abandoned the game.

1132,0,0.5245,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Well first of all I'd like to say, that this Hitman game gotta be the first in the series where there is absolutely no story cohesion at all. The missions feel random, there is almost no connection between them and most importantly you have no desire to finish the damn thing. The game is filled with an absurd amount of these so called challenges that are optional, but it feels like they were addded because the devs knew the game has a very very small replay value. The game feels very shallow in the core. This is a completely diferent hitman game to what anyone is used to, especially after the fantastic absolution that had a great story and gameplay was even better. In this one, you're just doing mindless tasks, completing arbitrary objectives to push you to the next location. It's boring, gameplay is extremely unsatisfying and everything just feels incredibly shallow, as I said before, this is barebones Hitman experience. What irritates me is the business model square enix desided to push on this one. Episodic content with a Hitman game, that will surely go well with both the fans and the newcomers. What's worse is that some of the contracts can only be completed in a specified timeframe which means if you miss it, it's gone for good. I absolutely despise this kind of business practices and it pains me to say that this is probably the worst Hitman to date and it's not only based on the square enix business choiches, but on the fact that this Hitman has absolutely nothing going for it, unless you like mindless killing of specified targets.

Iam currently only halfway through the game, just finished sapienza and Iam so bored I don't even want to continue playing. It's just the game is incredibly easy and very short, I managed to go through 3 locations in a time span of just hour and 15 minutes. That's just not good, considering there are only 6 locations and 1 bonus one. Currently the overall rating is at 4/10, will update the rating when I finish the game, Iam not expecting it to change, unless the game surprises me with the upcoming locations. Also I wouldn't reccomend this game for a hitman fan, simply because it's not very good. The locations are massive and at times overwhelming, but there is no point to them, it's just filled with mindless tasks and these so called challenges that serve only one sole purpose, to fill the game with stuff for you to do. Incredibly disappointed so far.

So I just finished the game and I have to say this has to be one of the most boring Hitman experiences ever made, the story is not interesting, the gameplay is unsatisfying and most of all this doesn't feel like a Hitman game whatsoever. It feels rushed and most importantly the business model this game took is just a mess in itself. Overall rating 4/10"

NO i do NOT recommend this game!!!

Dont get me wrong, nice grafix, nice looking polished game. But they forgot to explain how this game work. I have no idea how this game actually works. They just trow you in a map and hey see for yourself how you kill the basterds. There are a 100 ways to do it but figure it out yourself! I just have no idea what i should be doing other than shoot the idiot through there heads. you get no help or headsup on how to do things and worst of all i just dont see any other way than comming into a map get a suit and go the guy that needs killing and shoot him? 

Why dont they give you more tips on how to do things, help you dicover secret paths, help you find other weapons?

This game is half baked to me. Nothing is leading you how it should be. 

Than the contracts, another thing that does not work. (optional) way of killing: Sniper
After walking arround a map for an hour try to find a sniper i just quit the mission.

Contract try to find: this man (photo)

Onother thing, mastery level. WHY!!? why do i need to play the same mission 10 times to gain excess to more weapons just to find out that i can than only use tham in that level!? WHY!? why cant i use my unlocked weapons in another mission!? This game is NOT worth it! total fail to me.

As an FPS guy myself, that is something new, so the game gets points just for that. It's a game where you sneak around the town killing the criminals & ne-er-do-wells...so... sort of like James Bond, if you think about it! There is a mean neighbor from the poor side of town that sort of ruins things out of spite. My interest petered out right around the time that I went out & bought DOOM4 from Target. Also Metro 2033 Redux, but that was later on. Anyways, it is ok but I guess it's nothing special in my opinion. I installed the game, tried out a level or two & then deleted it.

Rating: 2/5 stars, waste of $17, not as good as the games I would otherwise be playing. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 comes to mind. That being said, the multiplayer in CoD is annoying nowadays so maybe there's a chance for HITMAN to swoop in & take over my evening ""goof off time"" hours? I guess nowadays there is competition for my after work time because it is motorcycle season & the zx6r isn't getting much attention lately, so.. I dunno man, it's ok enough but I've seen better.

On another, even more specific note, I bought the game ""Max Payne 3"" a few days ago & it is basically HITMAN on steroids, with a sort of adventerous 'band of brothers' type of thing going on & a very very interesting storyline that touches on some contentious topics.

Where is the adjustable sneak speed like on console? they have a speed toggle for the analogue stick why not make an analogue toggle for the mouse wheel so you can fully support your game? This feature was present in blood money.

There are many animations that seem to skip. What I mean is they will play out an animation and finish it in a pose, then skip with no animation back to their original pose before the animation begins. This looks janky.

Always online features prevent the after mission breifing and dissables many features. having it on is data mining.

A castrated version of Hitman Blood Money for casual non-Hitman-fans.
No more dual-wielding Silverballers, no weapon-costumization, no more ""media-coverage"" of your killings at the end, less maps and allways online-DRM.


Handholding: The Game!

The game is designed around force-feeding you information everywhere you go. It shows you the state of enemies, sneaks X-Ray-Vision into the game and does handholding for even the smallest tasks.
Sure, all can be turned off, but some areas are so cramped that you'll be catching yourself doing the X-Ray just ""one more time"" (instead of letting the camera show you the position and make you figure out the best way of approach!)

The controls are dumbed down (again) and illogical at times (E for use but G for different actions).

The soundtrack is forgettable & can't come even close to 47s first game.

Are the huge maps beautiful and full of life?
Yes, they are.
But there are only 6 maps! (!!!)

And where Blood Money gave you replayability with your enhanced guns, that you could mod and upgrade with your earned money (none of that here!),
here its just some new ""tasks"" to do,
all of them right in your face.

No more figuring out different strategies for yourself, the game tells you nearly every way of kills!
Even with the handholding turned off, the ""online contracts"" are shoved into your throat, giving away all of the pre-planning!

The story tries to demystify 47 again, with painful dialogue and a plot thats written like bad fanfiction by a teenager (I saw it got even worse with HITMAN 2 !).

Like I said: Even with all the hand-holding deactivated, the game plays like on rails, and tries
to hang the carrot in front of your face like ""new weapons"" (Pistols shoot all the same btw!) or entry-points.



ALLWAYS ONLINE:
In case your internet-connection dies (like - who knows? Provider needs to fix the cables, slow internet, playing somewhere without internet),
your GAME DIES!

In Offline you can't change entry-points (you know? the whole point of the shitty ""reward""-systen in ""Hitman"" ?!) and your load-out-screen freezes!

When in Offline, you don't have any statistics after finishing the level. Great isn't it?
(the statistics suck anyway, since they don't come in the cool Blood-Money-Styled media-coverage!).

All in all its not a real Hitman-game.
Its more of a puzzle-game, that wants you to solve the puzzle in a specific order and punishes you if you try different ways (especially if these ways involve fire-arms!)"

1154,0,0.6331,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","If you enjoy stealth games just avoid this piece of garbage.

At first I was impressed by how huge the levels were and how deep inside each complex the targets were hidden.  Then as I got a few hours in I realized this game is much, much less open then it really seems.  It's extremely gimmicky for a stealth title because of all the ""opportunity events"" that happen around the map.  These are basically conversations that you can eavesdrop on that give you some insight into guard procedure or target habits.  This seems interesting at first but is near impossible to follow up on without the game being in ""full"" advice mode.  This mode simply points you to where you should go next in order to find your way to that next disguise or subterfuge.  

Without being in ""full advice"" mode you will be floundering around, wandering and wandering around looking for a keycard or badge that lets you complete the next step of the event.  This is more shoehorning than older Hitman titles that just rely on your observational skills when looking for an opening.

The levels are packed, I mean PACKED to the brim with guards.  Without using heavy amounts of disguises you will be saving and reloading over and over.  And this is really my main complaint about the game.  It simply was not designed as older stealth games that are extremely punishing when it comes to being discovered.  Instead of ever having to re-do a level you will simply be put back 40-50 seconds as the game is constantly auto-saving.  It's like they encourage save-scumming as much as possible.  Even if you are determined not to save I bet you will end up caving as the conversational events can last as long as 40+ seconds.

This makes the Silent Assassin, suit only playthrough (veterans know what I mean) extremely difficult compared to older Hitman games.  You will have to abuse the A.I. in ways you haven't had to before in order to get through totally unseen.

And there's the game length....FOURTEEN HOURS!  And that's taking my time!  Six levels that they expect you to playthrough over and over and over.  You don't unlock anything for the next level, you don't purchase any weapons and bring them into the next level.  There's a shallow unlock system after winning a mission that is only pertinant to each of the six levels.  All this does is it makes that level easier as you can spawn closer to the target with more weapons!!  WHY WOULD I WANT AN EASIER VERSION OF THE LEVEL I JUST BEAT!  I JUST BEAT IT FROM THE HARDEST POSSIBLE POSITION!  What a great reward, thank you oh so much!

TLDR -
Convulted level design
Extreme amounts of hand-holding with gimmicky events
Extremely short overall length, bad price value
Barebones story
Bad graphical optimization
Horrible replayability

If you spent more than $20 on all six episodes you were robbed."

This game tried to follow the path of Blood Money and failed. The spark just isn’t there, the game felt bland and easy. Instead of letting us choose the path, we are given something called “opportunities”  which makes the game too easy, the tension isn’t there. I was hoping for something similar to the dark gritty mature levels from older hitman games but that wasn’t there too. The game has good graphics and the “opportunities” even if it makes the game too easy is scripted well. Then their whole episodic fiasco makes the game even worse, each level is meant to be played again and again, finishing it different ways, using different opportunities until the next episode is released. The game felt short for me even after I bought the game with all episodes released.

However the game still has too many things unnecessarily bound to being online. You can't even check your career progress offline. The performance is absolutely atrocious, too. I'm talking less than 20ish FPS on a very strong computer when playing outdoor missions like Morocco and Italy

That's not to say the game is without merit. I think there's a lot of potential for this release but it has yet to be realised at the time of writing. Here's a list of things that I think should convince you to wait for season 2 to complete.


[olist]
    [*]Bad gunplay (the worst yet in the series)
    [*]No weapon customization
    [*]Extremely poor performance
    [*]No base/shooting practice
    [*]Cannot extract weapons
    [*]Heavy grind focus
    [*]Unintuitive, slow & accident-prone context-based controls
    [*]No first person view mode
    [*]No blood trails
    [*]Overdesign of everything (eg, ringing sound on kills)
    [*]Bad audio (enemies sound like they're in boxes when nearby)
    [*]Can't add/remove suppressors mid-mission
    [*]Control tutorial popups that never go away
    [*]Contract creation is astoundingly uncustomisable
    [*]No suitcase/gloves despite promotional art teasing it
    [*]Odd and frustrating witness/spotted conditions
    [*]Mini-map designed gameplay (it's not even disabled in ""Pro"" mode)
    [*]Episodic release hasn't borne any positives yet
    [*]No dual-wielding
    [*]Thrown weapons are auto-aimed, headshot only

First off, It's not hard. 
To make it hard you can adjust the options to your liking in the gameplay menu or get to level 20 to unlock professional mode. 

Level 20.

You level up in a hitman game, and until you've completed the mission in a limited fashion you do not get access to OTHER WAYS to complete the mission. You know what that was in every other goddamn hitman game? A level. It was all there from the start. Even in Absolution. You want to put on a mascot outfit and samurai sword your targets through the head? Go for it. You didn't have to unlock the starting point next to the bear costume on top of the samurai display museum to enjoy these options. 

You also get to compete in leaderboards. You know, all those hitman fans were just sitting around thinking that I was missing internet points to compete with my other friends in how many times I can get points in this game about points. That's why the first few hitman games had a giant point counter in the upper right corner of the screen. So, you knew you were getting them leet points. POINTS? Clearly someone missed the goddamn POINT of hitman. It's to be a HITMAN. Kill a target, get creative if you want, but you can just as easily use a sniper rifle to kill two targets with one bullet. 
It was an accomplishment to have an elaborate or efficient kill. There wasn’t even an achievement in the old games for it, and the absolution achievements weren’t imposing about it either, they were just there if you figured out how to, for example, kill your target with the harpoon.

But that's not even the reason I am writing this anger filled review. 

No. The reason I'm writing it is because of a thing called elusive targets.
So, when I heard that hitman was going episodic, I hated it. The first thought that came to mind is “you literally just finished one level, didn’t you?” followed by “and if you didn’t you’re selling the game in parts to make as much profit as possible.” So, like anyone that isn’t addicted to video games, I didn’t feel like being blue balled AND robbed at the same time, so I put it off until the whole season 1 was available. I get it, and lo and behold, there’s this thing called elusive targets.

One time missions that are time sensitive? The hell were you thinking? Hitman shouldn’t be a test of preparation and skill, no, we need one time content. That’s what people like. Not being able to play content. Or having to give up, I don’t know, a vacation or work or school or some other shit to make time to get your “GENIUS” idea for one time non-repeatable content? Really? So, I miss 20 missions because Torben Ellert, the lead designer, literally admitted in an interview the AI they designed couldn’t hold up to repeated playthroughs? God, the MOBILE hitman game was better. 
Anyway, this is a horrible idea, a horrible package, and if you give them your money they will think that this is a good idea and they will continue to turn games into microtransactions either by butchering them like this and releasing them one limb at a time to your inbox or by having you literally pay to play. I can’t wait until they release the “ELUSIVE TARGETS 1-50 OUT NOW ONLY 50$.” 

And I thought EA was bad. 

Don’t misconstrue that. EA is bad, really bad. The actual worst. I haven’t bought an EA game since AC3, wait, no, I got that… child of light? I didn’t think it was an EA game at first. Not relevant. EA is worse than this company, but this is bad. Don’t buy it. Pirate it.

I've really enjoyed the previous hitman games but this one feels a bit flat to me. I think the core problem is it's designed to be episodic rather than a full game. I bought the full season 1 during a sale for $30, so I got it all at once. But it feels like every mission is meant to played over and over and over rather than having a cohesive story or even sensible individual missions (a lot of it seems based on memorization rather than planning/execution). I think that's why it feels shallow to me. The magic just isn't there and it ends up being more like Mario than a Hitman game.

On the bright side, it runs silky smooth on my system (I5-4690, RX 480 8GB, 16GB DDR3, Win 10) at 1080p on max detail. It looks pretty decent too. Nothing special, but certainly on par with anything else out there. Being an over the shoulder shooter/stealth game, control can be difficult and imprecise, but that's a long standing Hitman problem. One of old ones allowed first person, which was much better but sadly that was tossed long ago in favor of a great view of the barcode tatoo.

I'm inclined not to recommend this overall unless you can get it dirt cheap during a sale."

since everyone has talked about the online-only thing(which is also a factor) ill skip on to what else is in the game;

stuff i like:
+the world feels much more immersive. conversations, oppertunities and the ""preplanning"" add much to the world surrounding the mission
+custom user-generated missions add replayability to the missions(going beyond trying to earn all achievements and such)
+stealth feels much more necessary and guns blazing tactics are much harder to pull off, demanding more careful planning

stuff i dislike/why im voting no:
-the games performence; an issue in and of itself. my gear may not be at the top but im well above the minimum requirements so the game shouldnt stutter on low, and it seems im not the only one getting this.
-shooting feels awkward, changing sensitivity in the menu seems to hardly have had enough impact, and moving my cursor while in aim mode is hellishly slow
-while i was excited for being capable of melee takedowns and specialized *weapon eliminations*(double tap with pistols, knife kills and such) it died out fast when melee combat became more QTE than fights, during which you are locked in place and cannot move/cut out of the slugfest
-enemies can no longer friendly fire at each other. unlike in many older hitman games, where enemies could also hurt each other, this time they can only hurt you(and some props). combined with how melee fights work out, a group of 3 enemies would spray you dead through each other, thanks to the bullets phasing through their *friend* in a slugfest with you

and lastly(this is mostly a nitpicky thing of mine): a leaderboard isnt really what i want in a singleplayer game. 

while the game has its good points, i feel that at the price i paid and for what little of it i actually got to enjoy(much of my time on record is afk time from having to get up mid-game), i cant fully recommend it. adding to it the online only features(which, yes, we can now play offline but unlocks and challanges still seem to not be there for you when and if you want to play offline), i'd say if you want to give this game a spin you should wait for a sale."

1182,0,0.7463,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Almost every level in this game feels mechanical, soulless, and sterile. It feels as though the developers created a computer algorithm that can efficiently generate a passable Hitman level, then flicked a switch and had it dispassionately create all six of these boring sandboxes. Say what you will about Hitman Absolution (it had plenty of problems), but at least it had a sense of momentum and levels that, while often small and inconsistent in quality, had personality.

The game tries to get you to replay each level over and over, doing inane, boring tasks on a checklist in order to get levels of ""mastery"" in each map. This is not fun. Not even a little bit. I guess maybe if you took some adderall it would be fun, but adderall makes everything fun, so that's not a good defense. I can't speak for everyone, but what I loved to do in Blood Money was learn whatever I found to be the ""perfect"" way to play each level, then do that over and over, altering a few things here and there, but not really deviating much each time. To me, Hitman is about planning and executing the perfect covert assassination, and reliving it again and again. It's not about playing each level in ways that I find boring just to check off skinner box treats from a list.

Even if I ignore these superfluous, grindy objectives, the problem of the game feeling bland and empty persists. Each level feels like a checklist of fan-demanded criteria placed into a kaleidoscope and spun around a few times. Big sandbox? Check. Lots of options to kill enemies? Check. Lots of intricate verticality? Check. Many playthroughs required to see each level's content? Check.

The problem is that it's missing artistic vision. There's no zest or sense of joy to anything. The game feels hollow, rote, and barren. It's a token effort to cheerlessly deliver something to the fans that the developers evidently did not want to make. And why the balls do the guards and NPCs all have either British or American accents? It's so immersion-breaking to see a Morrocan guard tell me to halt with a undisguised American voice. It technically works, I guess, and the voice acting itself is competent, but it's all so lazy and not any fun. It's a good analogy for the rest of the game, now that I think about it.

If I had to rate each level:

Paris: 6/10 - Yay, a cube.

Sapienza: 8/10 - The one really good part of the game, with a bit too much unused space.

Marrakesh: 5/10 - Soooooo boring and aesthetically bland.

Bangkok: 7/10 - Decent. Still basically a cube, though.

Colorado: 5/10 - Way too small. Not worth $10.

Hokkaido: 7/10 - Decent. Aesthetically boring, but has a lot of mechanical intricacy.

All in all, the game is less than the sum of its parts, because it has no story and no sense of fun. It's a Hitman game designed by a computer."

On top of that theres obvious AI problems in the game - where you pretty often get spotted through cover or bodies youve dropped get spotted from a mile away thorough a crate or something else... A very bad design when you set up  your game to be completed without getting spotted... makes it halfway impossible - or atleast infuriating when you lose after hours of stealth... but lose to a failing mechanic rather than your own lack of skills.

BAD

-gameplay is klunky somewhat, feels outdated and restrictive
-stealth is not properly executed
-Agent 47 is totaly out of his charisma of old, it could be anybody else
-music is repeated and very un-Hitman like, lack of Jesper Kyd shows
-developers are expecting us to replay the level countless times to unlock some BS equipment, this is total failure
-elusive targets are just people walking or sitting somewhere with a constant two bodyguards around them, so you can't really make an original kill, and you are supossed to know and remember every inch of a level to complete the challenge to unlock some useless suit
-fluent English is spoken all around the globe, making the immersion non existent and the chit chat is pure cringefest.
-guns are pretty much useless, because you get no rewards for shooting anything (except sniper shots)
-you can carry loads of equipment with you and it's not seen anywhere on the Agent 47 (except rifles)

or it's about the online drm, that locks you out of a lot of options which is legit and I can sincerely sympathize with people who aren't privileged and don't have high speed internet or internet access everywhere they go. 

however my issue with this game is something else. there is barely any stealth in this stealth game and while we are at it, there is no competent AI present in this game. 
in fact I wouldn't blame anyone if they didn't understand what this game is supposed to be considering as a stealth game it fails, due to incompetent AI ( AI is the threat in a stealth game and with no threat, no tension and no need for stealth ), as a puzzle game it fails due to lack of enforcement of basic puzzle rules ( imagine a puzzle in which there are no rules. oxymoronic but the devs beg to differ ). 

so what exaclty is this game? a streamlined, dumbed down console game, stripped of anything that made hitman, what it was and sold to a crowd that doesn't understand what puzzle stands for or what stealth means. 
so in other words another generic, by the numbers, shiny game for the braindead crowd. like assassin's creed or far cry but at the very least these two ubisoft games include a fairly competent AI which can't be say about this kusoge."

1213,0,0.7575,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I really like this game, but I can't recommend it to anyone for four major reasons.

First, it's incredibly short - there just isn't enough content to justify $60. Weapons and gear have to be unlocked by completing challenges in a level, but by the time you've gotten the best weapons and gear, you don't need them or are tired of the level. They try to increase replayability by having you do ""Escalation"" contracts, but it's kind of boring and there's no reward for it.

Second, you have to be online to play, even by yourself. Don't get me started.

Third, guns are useless. They don't kill people unless you hit them in the head, and even shooting them in the chest only causes them to wince slightly before they keep shooting at you. In Absolution, there was a sort of reflex mode thing where time slowed down and you could mark your shots and then he'd do them. It wasn't perfect, but it was better than trying to use a watergun to take down a tank. Here's the key thing almost every video game misses: guns kill people. If it was easier to kill someone with a knife (or, in this case, a screwdriver), nobody would use guns.

Finally, the audio design is worse than terrible. You can hear the echo of the room in which they did the recording even when you're listening to people outside. Voices right next to you are quiet and muffled while important characters speak. Weapon sounds seem like they come from a royalty-free sound effects website. For some reason, whenever you drag a body, it sounds like leather rubbing against leather. Sometimes a conversation you want to listen to is inaudible because there's a plant in the way. The levels, especially the outdoors ones, sound empty. Compare the audio in Hitman with the audio in Grand Theft Auto V. In GTA V, you can walk down a street with your eyes closed and almost feel present in some virtual city. Close your eyes while you're in a plaza in Hitman and ask yourself how real it feels. It's been overlooked.

I can't figure out why this took them so long. Underneath the new graphics and storyline, it's virtually identical to Absolution, though it does feel a bit less cartoon-like. This episode-based storytelling is moneygrabbing nonsense. You will be severely disappointed when the game ends because it does nothing to resolve the conflict the other episodes center around.

All that said, this game is fun. If it's massively discounted (70%+), go ahead and get it. Otherwise, save your money for a game that's finished when it's released."

Only positive aspect would involve the graphics and level design. Detailed mapping and routing enables players to apply their creativity, however, it's very difficult to enjoy when the AI are stupidly flawed in addition to their abysmal voice-acting. Also, the music is very lacking; it doesn't match Agent 47s elusiveness.

I'll talk about the good first-

1. Running doesnt creep out the npc.
2. The missions are long and planned out (maybe to many armed npc).
3. Graphics
4. Instant agro mechanic isnt there when you split moment kill somthing you really need to be seen.
Example: I took out a walker in a crowded area with a screw driver at long range and wasnt suspected. So its easy in this version to make split moment descisions and evacuate the area afterwards like mashing a general and his body guard on a stair case in 2 seconds doesnt alert every armed goon on the map cause the gaurd saw you after second 1.

Lets talk about the bad-

1. Well I beat the first season in 10 hours bang for the buck isnt there.
2. The things that Hitman Fans LOVE are not present.
Example: Hitman bloodmoney gear system and modification not there- large mission loadout options very limited- No money system- theres more like gold guns and stuff or maybe I didnt do enough to earn a gold gun.
3. Very linear people will say you have freedom but you really dont- you have to take oppertunities or you just dont get in kinda feeling all the time.
4. I'd like to make a fart noise when I speak of replayability here. Really you feel like once your through a mission there really wasn't any other way for it to be done successful. Oh look a new starting location unlocked pfft. 
5. Health system terrible splash lens starts to grey out. Way to many armed gaurds on every map like 40-50 and 2 shots your dead if you hide you gain full health again....
6. I feel like this should have been an expansion for absolution, when will they get a clue we want a money system you know we are HITMEN WE NEED PAID, large weapon selection MULTINATIONAL store, Attachments store, and the games release pace for the seasons is way to slow, better loadout setup, I think absolution was better and it sucked.

Get a clue devs-You really should have took the time to ASK your fan base what they wanted from the game-
Money System that isnt limited-
multinational Weapon Store-
multinational Attachment Store-
multinational Appearance store-
Non linear gameplay-

The levels are gorgeous. Every area is painstakingly crafted in detail to represent a place teeming with life. Each one is an assassin's playground. The music and sound design are great.

However,
The replayability of the game comes in the form of mastery challenges and ""escalations"", that when completed, unlock items and perks to use in the current--or later levels. It sounds like a great system! but if you want some of the better gear, prepare for an exercise in tedium. 

""In what way, Mr. Lewis?"" Well, I'm glad you asked.

----
Let's take ""The Showstopper"" mission in Paris. There are:

26 assasination challenges requiring assasinating the targets in different ways.

5 challenges from the ""Holiday Content"" version of the mission to unlock a suit.

18 escalations. Yes, eighteen. What is an escalation you ask? It's a playthrough of the level with specific requirements. Completing one of these requires you to beat the entire level five times with increasingly harder requirements. That adds an extra NINETY playthroughs.

But that's not all folks!

There is a ""Professional"" difficulty with another 20 assasination challenges!

Then you add on the 70 or so miscellaneous challenges, some of which are fun and interesting thankfully, the savescumming to learn the level, and it all adds up to a lot of time.
----

AND THIS IS JUST A SINGLE LEVEL!

It should be said that not all of these must be completed to unlock 47's gear. But if you DO want to unlock all of the gear be prepared to spend upwards of 10-15 hours replaying a level over and over again.

Unfortunately the gameplay just does not lend itself to replaying a level over and over again, at least it didn't for me, which is why I cannot recommend this game. How many minutes do I want to spend crouching in a corner waiting for ""Target A"" to walk across half the map? Not many. Also, the story was very barebones (it's six short cutscenes between the levels). 

If you are a completionist like me, then you will give yourself a complex trying to complete all the challenges. Do yourself a favor and play Absolution for a tighter, more concise experience with an actual story!"

The elusive target is a cool idea, but in reality is just absolutely infuriating because additional weapons, items, consumables, and costumes are locked behind them and if you happen to have a job or for any reason are busy during them, you just miss out.

Maybe they'll get it right next time, but I bought this over christmas and they've already decided to spit in my mouth by releasing a ""bonus episode"" for another $10.  The game doesn't have enough content to warrant its huge price tag, well knowing you'll have to shell out $10 more every time you want a new level.  And the extra content they provide to make it worthwhile to play levels again are on a strict time limit and one-attempt mode, which is absurd.  Like making you pay for a map pack you can only play 5 matches of cawadooty on."

1250,0,0.7644,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","First off, this game has Denuvo DRM and needs to be constantly connected to the game's servers.
Yes, you can play offline, but you won't be able to finish challenges, and you won't be able to get the rewards, and those are the real goals of the game.
This is enough for a not recommended review, in my opinion, because of the invasive DRM and anti-consumer practices. You're renting the game, not buying it, because who knows what will be of the Denuvo and game servers in the future. They may also block you access to it if you do something against the EULA, like cheating or modifying files - just a warning, though, as I gotta say I haven't seen this happen to anyone yet.

I've played this series since the second one, Silent Assassin, and finished them all, except Codename 47, the first. I'm a fan of the IP, and I gotta say that I like this new game, but I'm very disappointed.
I believe IOI made with great care, and also as a love letter to the fans of Blood Money, but the gameplay and focus of the original four games is gone, and I really miss it. This game feels clunky to move, clunky to shoot, and clunky to interact. It uses context actions while the originals were more dynamic. Context actions are good in simple, entirely slow paced games, and Hitman is never like that, not even while sneaking. That's why, when you press the key to subdue a guy, you might see it changed at the last second to punch them - because they're climbing the stairs or made a slight turn, for example - ruining your silent assassin attempt.

I gotta say I prefer Absolution even though the story was absolutely terrible. It knew what it was as a game and had a clear direction with it's gameplay and narrative. Hitman (2016) changed a lot of core mechanics over all the year since the launch until the physical release. One of them being the way noise works - or rather, doesn't. Now, if you shoot an SMG in the direction of someone without hitting him, but hitting the walls and objects around him, he won't hear it and will continue on it's way. Bullet impact noise has no effect anymore.
Absolution also had the best shooting in the series, and was trying something different, even though it wasn't that well received with Hitman veterans. I liked Absolution's idea as a spin off of the series and I liked how it played, even though I prefer Silent Assassin, Contracts and Blood Money way more.
In this latest one, they took the Absolution shooting mechanics and gimped it to hell. I don't know exactly what happened, but it feels strange, like it has some kind of mouse acceleration, and it makes incredibly frustrating to shoot anyone. Using guns is never a good idea because somehow 47 forgot how to shoot, and there are lots of better ways to kill a target. Maybe not as fun as it could be if the guns worked, but way more effective.
This game also has a very easy way to subdue anyone. You just need to - very easily - lock on a throwable blunt weapon or object at someone's head to make him unconscious for the rest of the level - or until someone finds him and wakes him up. Not even in Absolution it was that easy to knockout characters, and in older games you had items with limited uses, like a rag with chloroform or sedative syringes, also with a limited effect. One important layer of the challenge of the game is now completely gone in Hitman (2016).

I also feel they took too much of the player's advice to heart, and never really understood what they were doing when trying to emulate Blood Money. Hitman now has challenges that need to be completed to earn weapon, item and starting location rewards. Challenges consist of all the different ways you can kill a target, all the disguises you can use, all the ways you can infiltrate and all the other little things you can do in each level. This is the real goal of the game, and the only replay value that it really has. The game can be completed fairly quickly, otherwise. There is no joy of discovery, because the game constantly pushes you to finish all the different - but very similar - challenges, while playing the level almost exactly, over and over again, to ""master"" it and get more rewards, and I feel this kinda of exploration is a choice that should've been the player's. There is no need to squeeze the level dry with a skinner box mechanic.
Some may like this grind, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it's something to note. I feel burned out with most of the levels because of it.
Some people also may argue that it's better to disable the challenges in the UI, and try to do it all without guidance, but you'll still be trying to find and finish the challenges as your end goal.

There is also a very strange glitch that should never be in any stealth game: Sometimes, randomly, someone might witness you commiting a crime because somehow they can look through walls. Yeah, this game has an X-ray vision glitch, since launch, that can ruin your stealth playthrough of a level. People might see you knocking out or killing someone, even with one or more walls in the way.

Even though I listed only the negatives, this is not a bad game. Not at all. It's a good, although flawed, game, but as a lot of people say of Absolution, I'll say the same to this one: It's a good game, just not a good Hitman game."

That said, even having no internet connection issues myself, this game was overally less free and creative than titles before it with assasinations. It's like a solid 6.5/10.

Some normal offline stuff suddenly became fancy online stuff.

NPCs can sometimes see through doors and walls, look or even walk in different directions, targets spot you and ruin your rating before they get killed and count as witnesses after, everybody can perform a 180° turn in split second, close encounters on the stairs usually result in loud melee combat because quiet animation doesn't work. Most of the mechanics are fine, but those broken moments are really annoying.

Elusive Targets can only be completed once. Because Hitman is replayability, but apparently not this time. You are not allowed to have fun twice. Well, if you create another steam account and use family share, then you are, but the game still wants to make a statement. This part of the game is forced to be online for no reason and tries to be a service available for a limited period of time.

The story is short and feels like a teaser with a cliffhanger. And this teaser has 6 episodes. I believe, the rest of the story is yet to be written and may not quite connect well, just like those CGI pre-release trailers that were kinda like a concept art, part of which did not end up in the finished game.

Pros
-Sapienza (one of the best levels in the series)
-Various ways to kill your targets (yet they are oversimplified and linear.)
-New engine
-Solid graphics
-Playtime is quite huge if you like all these contracts, escalations etc

Cons
-Episodic release, they compensate the lack of content with a need to grind (seriously, 20 mastery level to have a higher difficulty?)
-No story at all (even that story ended up in cliffhanger)
-I personally find Colorado, Hokkaido and Bangkok levels pretty weak
-Missing features from former games (like briefcase) 
-The game feels unfinished, animations, voice acting, all of this is at the level of the first episode Paris, there was no improvement to it at all.
-Lacks depth of former games, everything feels too cartoonish
-Elusive targets will get very quickly boring, they are all repetitive

I played it since Episode 3.
At overall, I'm glad I have all episodes for free (except Intro Pack) because otherwise I would have been disappointed with this game even more. Hitman newcomers will probably like this game, but I, personally as a guy that finished every single game of this game call this a disappointment. I don't like grinding at all, I don't have enough time for it. I just want to start the game, load a mission on the highest difficulty and complete it in different ways.

- mechanics from Hitman: Blood Money

Cons:
- first season is just 1/3 or 1/2 of whole game. Final let you with lot of questions because nothing from main plot is explained. So you pay full prize for just a part of the game. 
- This whole episodic selling crap is worst thing that could happen to Hitman franchise. Only purpose for that is to milk more money from gamers, lowering production costs and lowering risk for making next episodes. 
- developers tried makes game look longer by adding ridiculous amount of enemies. Sometimes it's good but usually it kills player creativity. Because of that you can kill certain targets only by this few obvious ways that creators put in the game. You can't improvise and kill them as you want.
- Game work horrible on my MSI Radeon R9 290 (gaming OC) with i5 4670 and 8 gb RAM.  Framerate is choppy as hell. Good thing that Hitman is not very dynamic game so you don't really care abaut solid 60fps.  
Graphics is jerky - sometimes it's beautifull, sometimes ugly as my mother-in-law. 

If you want to buy this game just wait for all episodes and seasons. I know it's propably for one or two years or maybe never, but right now it's not worth full prize. 

There is a lot of additional content, like contracts, but for me it looks like developers were tried to hide fact that game was castrated and artificially prolong it by making people to do the same thing over and over again. But without a main story and contest it's not even half as enjoyable. 

On the bright side: Hitman can really be good in the future. Everything that makes good Hitman game is here. It's not Absolution, it's definitely more like Blood Money... well at least half of Blood Money:)"

 - just go 20 meters from a guard in a semi dark in direct line of sight : he does not see you.
- have a suspicious behavior by listening to a conversation you shouldn't. It's ok just go 3 meters away in plain sight. You get spotted 1 times, 2 times, 3 times ! No worries !
- go around with a wrench a silenced gun, a wire 2, whatever. Nobody remarks anything ! No worries !

I'm a hardcore hitman fan, and I gotta say - this is the worst game in hitman franchise. This game is NOT improved blood money, this is RETARDED blood money.

They did the right thing going back to old hitman formula, but it doesn't work this time. The game is unpolished, animations are ABYSMAL, graphics are outdated, mechanics are just copied from blood money without ANY improvements, even more: they are simplifed and plain stupid. They scratched all the good ideas Absolution had, maps offer good replayability but there's too few of them. The game is lacking in every possible way: gameplay is boring compared to blood money and the artstyle sucks balls compared to absolution - there's NOTHING interesting in this game, and the selling model is a rip-off.

AI and the mechanics are blatantly stupid - AI doesn't react to obvious suspicious things (it was better even in silent assassin) and there's no purist mode - sure, you can disable all GUI if you wish so, but the game fails to feed you necessary information without HUD turned on, so either you play with some of the HUD on, or you just trying to get lucky.

Are you thinking about buying this game? Please, go back to replaying old hitman games (even contracts FFS) and don't waste your money on this failed experiment on how to rip off people of their money.

Playing aggressive is boring compared to previous Hitman where it was a good way for extra fun.
If you keep moving, you can easily kill everyone in the mission without problem, you also have health regeneration, where on Hitman 1,2,3 you don't, so you can just kill one, get hit, hide, heal, peek again.

The ragdolls when killing people feel shallow. When you get hit, 47 doesn't do any animation of a bullet hitting you, or blood marks on you (which previous Hitman do have), you only see the screen getting darker and a red marker from where you are getting hit.

Go away.

Oh. Great. Yet another patch that penalizes creativity in favor of adding crappy scripted nonsense and completely shutting down any attempts at recreating Blood Money's gameplay. What's that? The community found out that shooting somewhere makes guards suspicious? Nah, too realistic. Gone. What? The gameplay is too inconsistent, you say? Well, let's add in head movement for no reason! That's what everyone wanted, right? Oh, so the community found a way of dealing with two people at once without having to wait around for 16 months? Nah, removed by replacing the way the ""compromised"" feature works with a completely asinine ""unconcious witness"" stat. Basically, as soon as anyone even REMOTELY SLIGHTLY MAYBE catches a GLIMPSE of you doing ANYTHING, they're a witness and you might as well restart. Add in the fact that basically nothing anyone's ACTUALLY asked for has been implemented or fixed, like 1. fixing head movement, 2. fixing the inconsistency with silent attacks, where if you're standing behind someone but you're 4 degrees off, you won't silent attack them but instead punch them in the face and get spotted, 3. fixing the lock-on mechanics, 4. not nerfing everything that's even remotely fun into the ground? and you'll find out that IOI just doesn't give two fucks (anymore?). Also, the new ""Professional"" difficulty is the cheapest, laziest attempt at a difficulty spike imaginable. Move or remove every item or disguise that's there in ""Normal"" difficulty, make every melee weapon practically useless, add cameras and enforcer guards at every corner and you have the uninspired mess that is ""Professional"". Clearly just advertising for getting more people to buy the ""Full Experience"" for another 50 bucks.
The game itself definitely has the potential to be better than, or at least on par with, Blood Money, but as it stands right now, with all the crap listed above and a lot, LOT more quirks and annoyances worthy of complaining about that I couldn't be bothered to write down, it's just a little better than Absolution. Which, needless to say, is not very impressive. But, I assume IOI won't put down the nerf gun anytime soon, if ever, so unless you like following mindless ""Opportunities*"" (at the current pace, in a few months there won't be any actual gameplay left, just opportunities) and annoying everyone with your 12 hours of gameplay time and statements such as ""wow good grafiks!!!"", save your money until this game takes its (rightful?) place as the successor of Blood Money. However, I'm not holding onto too much hope there.

*Opportunity: Highly scripted tutorial-esque solution for completing certain levels that literally tell you what, when and how to do something in order to beat the mission.

TL;DR: Fun things get patched, bugs, glitches and restrictive gameplay get enforced or ignored.

My first Hitman was 'Contracts' which by the way of course I loved it a lot since I was ten years old and I had spend a lot of hours of awesome gameplay!
Same goes to 'Blood Money' that game man had so better graphics than contracts not that I cared that much I only needed to play the new Hitman series.But I didn't worrie If the game was bad because IO new what must be inside the game and specially the targets you need to kill and which specific way you must do it I loved it!
And next we have New Hitman coming on 2016 that came from the community of Hitman as far as the sources I have read...And they say that they that they did their best to come allong to Hitman blood money so the community would remember their old memories(at least I did remember my old memories and I actually said 'Man they did some fine job' but that goes to until the episode 4.Later than that they just lost my focus and I feld bored).
Also I didn't like the that specific notice I get when I open Hitman which says 'Connecting to Server' WHAT?
Really IO? All Hitman games was just with a computer and no internet connection needed and now you throw at my face that crap and killing my entire love for Hitman     (Maybe from the other hand want something different so you can impress the lads that love Hitman but that didn't bring any good)
I thought that you IO would understand what the community needs.What the community say and you just WON'T accept it! The people that have bought this Hitman series must choose between Offline and Online(In my case I just unplug the net cable) with the same choises and not separating the choises you have In online from the offline(because lets face it Its a single player game for the people who don't know the rest of the Hitman series).
So many people won't buy Hitman because of the reason that you separate that very specific thing.I also wan't to make this thing come true but I know you won't.You just WON'T
I thought that with the retail coming out you would make a nice update and make those saparated things one.
I hope one day you will my dear IO...I'm telling you those worlds as a Hitman lover since 8years 

So my experience tells me that you should not buy this until the online features would be same as the offline and you won't have to reach some specific level(Masteries) to unlock it and that would be only on Online.So the lads who enjoy single player without internet they will be limited to this thing.

Bottom line...Do I recommend this game?
No,until the update comes until then shield up your patience and chill maybe,someday IO will hear our complaints

Ok here's the deal.  The game itself is pretty solid.  If you remove the context of what you're doing, it's a stealth puzzle game.  Use whatever is at your disposal (disguises, gadgets, weapons) to eliminate targets in multiple ways.  The hangup that most people have is the online requirement.

Recently they put in an offline mode that allows you to play with what you've unlocked so far.  However, you can't play offline and complete challenges to progress in getting more drop locations, gear, or starting locations.  You have to be connected to their servers for that.  This doesn't mean that levels are locked out.  You can play them in any order you want regardless of what you've already completed (as long as you own that mission).  You can have the best ISP with no issues.... but if you can't sign in or get kicked out, you really are just playing in some form of practice mode where your progress doesn't count.  This doesn't mean that levels are locked out.  You can play them in any order you want regardless of what you've already completed (as long as you own that mission).

However, the always-online option works less often than it doesn't. You can get disconnected and lose progress, lose attained challenges, be unable to start a level and play, and even be unable to go offline and play without all those unnecessary bells and whistles meant to crudely disguise the fact that this is, in its nature, just a terribly draconic DRM.

The story, while somewhat minimalistic(sort of a extreme opposite of absolution) happens in cutscenes, inbetween missions and I think that works very well, but there could be more of it.. I wouldnt say, that there isnt one, like many players here..

However the game, for the full price - is just too short imo, sure, theres alot of replayability in here, one should always be mindful of that. But honestly I feel, there should have been at least three more maps, or even double the ammount for the price.

The graphics are quite good. They're not GREAT, but they are certainly good enough that I'm able to enjoy the game without being pulled out my immersion by bad art.

I'm not a fan of the control layout on the keyboard - it feels very much like a solid console game that was ported over, or perhaps a PC game with a UI designed by folks with a heavy console background. You can get used to it, though, even if it always remains a bit of a distraction.

There are major issues with the mouse input on this game, no matter what your FPS is the game will misfire on the mouse movement, as if it wasn't OPTIMIZED to detect mouse input at the required rate, there are a few workarounds like setting game priority to real-time , unplugging all additional peripherals on the off chance the game gets confused and doesn't know what to do with all the devices it should be ignoring in the first place, the fact that this is required is absolutely unsettling.

Next would be the absolute crappy key bindings and button layout , a clear carry over from the porting process where every single action has a button, (WHY???), much like that of a remote , so playing it with a keyboard is very uncomfortable and frustrating,  in a pressure situation you will miss a button and get shot in the face seeing that it's very hard to constantly reach across the keyboard to press the drag body button which is B by default, or dropping your M416 which is G, provided that G is used in many games it adds to the over all aggravation with all the other finger stretches you will be doing.

Unless you are willing to play the game with a remote provided you have one, then everything seems to fall into place, in exchange for the over all and expected PC experience packing it's bags and climbing out the window.

All in all, I found it very charming.  The setting feels very populated with conversations you can overhear ranging from opportunities to help you hit your target to just commentary on the situation at hand and that sort of attention to detail is something I, personally, really like.

So, why don't I recommend this game?

To put it as simply as possible, it's just too expensive.

Requiring players to be online is something that benefits the company at the expense of player experience and, as you can see from other reviews, this has caused some problems.  This feature aught to lower the overall cost of the game from $60 (and it is a $60 game, even if you chop it up into smaller parts).

Aside from that, there's just not a lot of content there right now.  Elusive targets and other extra missions in the same settings creates some definite replayability, but in the end, you're running through the same settings again and again.  To be clear, this game does have replay value, I'm not denying that, but that seems to have been a crutch in it's development.  Less content now for the promise of content later, content they don't have to work as hard to produce.  This aught to lower the price as well.

It's just not up to the caliber of other $60 games.  I got it during the holiday sale for 50% off and, for a $30 game, I think it was worth it.  Not the full $60, though."

As a longtime (since Hitman 2) Hitman fan, I wanted so badly to like this game. After the steaming turd sandwich that was Absolution, I was hoping this was going to be the game to finally return the Hitman franchise to it's former glory. Although clearly better than Absolution, this game just can not get out of its own way, and misses every oppertunity to live up to it's own potential.

The gameplay is a hybrid of Absolution, and Blood Money, but way too much of the former, and not enough of the latter. 
The game has great graphics, I'll give it that, but the levels (with the exception of level 2) are all lifeless and sterile. The game gives you way too much help, and you can't turn off many of the features that make the game way too easy, such as seeing which gaurds can see through your disguise on the map.

The disguise system is way too easy. Only certian clearly designated enimies can see through your disguises, so you never have to wory about being discovered in disguise. Levels are liniar, lifeless, and everyone on every level has an American accent. The voice actors didn't even try.

The DRM is excessive, and punishes legal players far more than it prevents piracy. If you lose connection to their servers (even if it's their fault) you lose all progress, and nothing you do from that point onward will actually mean anything. That alone is worth a thumbs down.

Overall this game is a total flop. I can not reccomend anyone spend money on this game, even on sale. I was hoping this would be the game to revive the Hitman franchise and restore it to it's former glory. Now I think it's probably the last we'll be seeing of ol' 47, and I can't help but think ""Good riddence."""

The First part of this Review  Is an explanation of  what I am reviewing To find out why I felt  An explanation of what I was reviewing  was necessary read the first part .  If you just want the review of the product  
 HITMAN™: INTRO PACK [Prologue + Episode 1]  Read the second part . 
 
 
Part 1  explanation of which product I am reviewing . 




A as  with   all of my reviews I like to read both positive and negative reviews of  a product. To see the main points of the product   
Reading both points of view it was   It seemed that the positive reviewers  and the negative reviewers where talking about two different products. I soon discovered the reason for this Is that the sales page is selling two different products.  
  
  
I received this  as part of the     Square Enix surprise package  so  after playing it .  I would say that I had be lied to. If I had paid for it based upon  The description   on the sales page. Which is the following.   
  
Become the master assassin in an intense spy-thriller story across a world of assassination.   
Travel the world from France, Italy & Morocco to Thailand, USA & Japan to take out powerful, high-profile targets.   
  
Complete freedom of approach in expansive freeform classic HITMAN levels   
100+ hours of gameplay will challenge the creativity of all assassins   
Create your own hits and compete with other assassins in Contracts mode  
  
 
Given that description  I was expecting    a little more than 3 maps . As well  the  cut scenes in the promotional video that never  show up in the game I received .  What is actually being sold here are two different games  on the same page   the game  I was given was    
  
the HITMAN™: INTRO PACK [Prologue + Episode 1]      which as described  includes the prologue and episode 1  3 maps 4 if you include the special Christmas map which is really  just the  episode 1 Paris map     
  
 Part 2  review of    
 
the HITMAN™: INTRO PACK [Prologue + Episode 1]   
 
       
I have got good points bad points and one you decide point Odd i know but the  product being sold .  
 is odd . 
Good points   
  
1  3 large  maps  with multiple   ways to  kill your target  as well as different challenges .  
  
  
  
2 bad points  game forces you to connect to an on line server  in order to receive  game stats.    
  
3 you decide point   
  
  possible future  on line subscription service 

-
It looks like  what     Square Enix  is going to do with this product. Is have some sort of on line subscription service like a  magazine or comic book series  They are selling the game maps IE episodes at the present time for $5.99  each .  But maybe once  they get the on line subscription thing  going you may get them for less.  
  
to summarize If  you  are not concerned about  game stats   You  want  a game with 3 unique maps with multiple ways to kill your targets I recommend  the HITMAN™: INTRO PACK [Prologue + Episode 1] .   If however  you want a game with more than 3 locations  and are concerned about game stats. I do not recommend   HITMAN™: INTRO PACK [Prologue + Episode 1]     
 
Given the  ambiguous nature of the marketing of this product. and the resulting bad reviews. Over that marketing  I expect. A very steep price drop If you feel the above  product as I described is to much for you  but you still want it  I  would  put it on your wish list and  wait till it goes on sale ."

Its a good game but the reason why i do not recommend it to buy is because for me personally the DRM that is being used is Punishing me as a Customer for giving SE money. I should have just Pirated it and then i could play the game as it is intendet. As it is you can play a castrated version of the game offline, but most features, starting locations and basically everything that make the game replayable are locked behind a retarded DRM scheme. Its quite sad, its also sad that the game is cut into pieces. What where they thinking??? So i guess if youlike to play Hitman and you do experience sometimes slight connectivity problems, Just Pirate it and dont feel bad doing it you deserve a Functional Version"

Do people still pirate games ? they are so cheap through steam, i dont think many people do it anymore.. so to stop the few pirates, they have punished the many legitimate gamers.. Stupid decision from IO Interactive and Square Enix. Soon as they stop supporting this game, and their servers go down you will no longer own the game anymore.

thank hezues i did not pay full price, that's the only real way i can recommend this game is getting it on sale. and because the gameplay is just so darned good.
there is no story, and there doesn't need to be. you're an agent with a number, i don't need a back story/or anything else for that matter. absolution was lame, but this, this is gold.
i got the base game as part of the square enix holiday surprise box, and was like ""oh cool the new hitman game!!"" so i started playing and beat the intro levels and paris and it started yelling at me to buy the expansions, took me about 2 hours to get that far. i seriously don't believe the 3 levels it gives you are worth 15$, let alone a sale price. the whole game on sale though? definitely worth it.
but then here's square soft's business model now, and it's effin rediculous. 
give them a portion of the game, get them to really like it, THEN RIP THE CONTENT FROM UNDER THEM AND CHARGE MORE!!!!
eff off square enix. i'm tired of your sheit.

this game is really gd fun though. i just can't recommend it with how square enix has been handling themselves as a company of late. if you really want to be a modern day assassin and not have a lame story shoved down your throat and want the olden days of hitman back, this is where it's at.

The ""online mode"" is bogus. There is no extra content - it's exactly the same game, but your stats are not updated in offline mode. Without a continuous internet connection, you are stuffed. You need to stay online continuously for hours (because that's how long each level lasts). If the internet goes offline, even for a short while, you are disconnected and lose your progress. 

Very few people have a completely reliable connection. WiFi has interference, and ADSL modems reset occasionally. So almost everyone who bought this game has had a bad experience - ""Disconnected"" in the middle of a level.

The unfortunates who bought the full game in the spring had to wait 6 months for delivery. That's appalling service, and they did it to them on purpose.

Hitman could have been a great game, but the managers ruined it. Did they sabotage the franchise deliberately, or was it just incompetence? Same effect either way. Bearing in mind the bad gaming experience and short story, this game is worth at most $10."

I purchased Hitman 2016 full game with prolog +episodes 1-6, after playing hitman: blood money & hitman Abosolution (Both games I enjoyed) I was shocked @ the lack of content in this game. For $60USD I expected more then 6 levels, even hitman bloodmoney had more content then this. Asked Steam for refund was denied because I played 4.3 hours(Beat all Story missions & challanges in under 5 hours) (Steam only allows 2 hour max for refund). Don't Buy the game now @ $60USD full retail price this feels like a rushed product that was not finished aka steam greenlight or a pre alpha. 

Gameplay/controls felt clunky compared to hitman abosulution which imo is a better game then 2016 hitman,Tested with keyboard/mouse & Xbox one controller. This game just screams cash grab & milking customers with its episodic release's.

The most fun part of Hitman is you beat a level, unlock new cool equipments, starting disguise, starting area etc, and replay the level in a different ways, then repeat. The progression system encourage you to replay the same missions.

The voice acting in this game are very basic, there is a Bangkok hotel missions that every staff speaks like an American. NPC dialogue are cringe worthy, sometimes they just spit random words that dosen't make any sense, its could be immersion breaker but i found it hilarious.

Unfortunately this game get held back by online DRM, not recommended if you have bad or unstable internet connection.

Instead of making a long in-depth game, developers have you play the same level over and over doing things slightly different to get the achievement.

Pros:
+ Great Visuals 
+ Fun gameplay 
+ Detailed levels 
+ Extra contracts are fun
+ Great cinamatic story telling 

Cons:
- You have to be always connected to the internet, it is annoying if you lose connection your game freeze up and it asks you to reconnect, its pure BS its a singleplayer game.
- this game is basicly a cashgrab in the name of hitman, the story doesn't go far! it just leaves more questions than answers because they will be releasing new seasons 

So the Verdict is 
BUY IT: if you just care about killing targets and playing the game without caring about the story 
DO NOT BUY @ FULL PRICE - BUY ON SALE: If you love hitman and you want to see more of Agent 47's Story then you need to buy this only don't pay full price get it when it goes on sale !

So as a huge Hitman fan i'm not recommanding because i feel for 69.99$ CAD it really wasn't worth it the story was very stale !"

1380,2,0.418,"online, server, always, save, connection, offline, mode, lose, connect, need","HITMAN is an excellent video game completely ruined by some awful choices made in development, specifically in regards to the online component.

TL;DR: The gameplay is great but the batshit stupid always online system will probably ruin your enjoyment of the game and may mean the game won't be fully playable in a few years.

Note: at the time of writing I have not prgressed beyond the Sapienza story mission, so there are some details I have no opinion on and won't be discussing below. Part of me wants to continue with te game but I'm so sick of its bullshit I don't know if I will or not.


The Good:

After the more linear, story-driven Absolution, the Hitman series returns to free-form, creative pre-meditated murder that the series as a whole has been traditionally known for. Although I quite enjoyed Absolution for what it was, this is only a good thing since there are no other series that provide quite the same experience as Hitman.

From Absolution, Contracts make a return, which is a welcome way to increase replay value.

The developers have made some effort to point players towards some of the more interesting ways of completing missions, through ""opportunities"" (basically sub missions within missions with their own checkpoint markers) and challenges. While these do make the game a bit easier and somewhat guide the player, they are an effective way of giving players new to the franchise a feel for how the game can be played.

The game also looks gorgeous, which helps bring the huge environments to life, and the soundtrack is excellent.


The Bad:

Bizarrely, the same voice actors are used in all levels of the game, meaning that British and American actors are used for all nationalities. It's very off-putting and makes the whole game feel like a production, much like the ICA missions in the tutorial.

Loading times are also long and frequent, unless you happen to have a perfect run.

The servers also seem a bit unreliable. When I try to play online, I seem to constantly be disconnected and need to reconnect. This wouldn't necessarily be such a huge problem but, well...


The Ugly:

Some server issues are annoying, but forgivable, for me, even in a single player game. For example, I remember MGS V had some issues that were annoying, but, crucially, did not affect my ability to play the game. What is unforgivably stupid about HITMAN, is that loss of connection to the servers will pause gameplay and going offline will not only kick the player to the main menu, but will cause all checkpoints to be lost until the player can reconnect to the servers. If you have anything less than a perfect Internet connection (and quite possibly even if you do), this makes the game a very unpleasant and frustrating experience. It also raises questions about whether or not HITMAN will be playable in a few years time. When so many features of the game are reliant on a connection to the servers, what happens when those servers are shut down?


I want to love HITMAN. Silent Assassin, Contracts and Blood Money are some of my favourite games and this is like the modern version of those that I've wanted for years, but ultimately it's left me not wanting to waste my time just trying to play it. If the game is patched to revise how the always online system affects the player experience, then I will most likely come back and revise my recommendation, but at the moment I genuinely think it should not be bought at any price."

The reason being is that it is simply bugged to all hell. I was willing to overlook it before the addition of Professional difficulty, but no longer. Having only one save in expansive levels where multiple things can go wrong is challenging. Having only one save in a game that auto f*cks you for reasons unknown is infuriating.

Looking at the back of an NPC's head ready to choke him out? Nope, immediately turns into a frontal detected assault on their facehole. Randomly. 

Ready to judo chop a guy walking on the stairs? Nah, same as before.

Want to sneak past a guarded opening to make that guy right at the corner count sheep? Forget about it, the guards that slightly saw you before still see you (invisibly) through walls and detect you when you attack.

Think you're being a badass hitman shooting a silenced sniper far off in the distance with 100% chance of not being detected? You're funny. All guards immediately know your general location.

This is a joke of a game, and an attrocity of a Hitman title. The story, of what little there is, is actually pretty interesting. Past that? Go play Absolution for an up close knitty gritty feel to 47, and Blood Money if you want to feel like an actual assassin."

PC Specs
6700k OC to 4.5ghz
ROG Hero Alpha Z170
16GB DDR4 G Skill Trident Z 3200mhz
GTX 1080 MSI SEAHAWK EK Custom
Samsung Evo 850 500GB 2x in RAID 0 
Full Custom Swiftech Loop Dual 240mm Rads (Too many parts to List Here Just know temps are wayyy down)
2560 x 1440p Asus Monitor

Game Played MAXED OUT everything DX 11 not DX 12. Wating for my 960 Evo M.2 drive to install windows 10 fresh install then I will test out DX12

Graphics- The game looks down right beautiful. The enviroments are so detailed as well as the density of the levels have NPC's everywhere. Feels so alive. Smooth gameplay no major FPS drops or graphical mishaps. ( I played the game with a 4770k and 980ti and turned a few settings down but still smooth gameplay)

Gameplay- Hitman Veteran Players will feel right at home. Mechanics and gameplay feel very intuative if you have played the others. Not hard to get a grasp of if a new player either.

Now the whole play the level over and over to get used to NPC behaviours and doing different kills is something your either going to love or hate. In my opinion I was more of a fan of the linear level style of Hitman Absoution. I am most likely one of few that feel this way. I just felt like was more of a story in absolution, more levels, and the game had momentum that led me to want to keep playing that next section. I did play the game a few times (back on PS3 in 2012) and also played through on PC in 2015 and was fun to try a different playstyle through the new playthrough. I never did find myself repeating a level right after finishing though.

So in conclusion the game runs very well, at least on higher end hardware 4770k 6700k 980ti 1080, but cannot speak to other configurations as I have not tested. The world is alive, well done graphically, details and mechanics of game work well. 

Just be aware of the type of game this is. It is a game of repetition. You become the badass 47 by playing level over and over and over. First time on a level will be a mess of you fumbing around being spotted and screwing up. After a few tries you become the badass 47 and can do a flawless play not being spotted by anyone and making your escape. I just felt no motivation to keep playing the levels. Lost intrest quick. I ended up finishing all the levels (episodes) and the bonus missions in about 17hrs. Just in my opinion I wish there was a more compelling story to keep me playing, but that is my personal preference.

Good luck to those who purchase! Hopefully this helps you know what you getting into!"

1393,4,0.6114,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go","Let's see... At this point, a prospective buyer of the full game has two options:

1) pay $60 upfront for an unfinished game that they'll have to wait months to ""episodically"" trickle into existence, or

2) incur a $5 penalty/premium by paying $15 for the game content that's actually ready and consumable now, and then another $50 (for an eventual total of $65) at some indefinite point in time later this year when the majority of the product they're paying for is *actually* available.

Square Enix has apparently adopted a policy of punishing their customers. They can either buy the entire, yet-to-be-released game upfront and wait months for Square Enix to deliver it, or wait until there's an actual, consumable product that delivers the content that they paid for and pay more for it.

Excuse me Square Enix, but I simply can't resist asking: Have you completely lost your god-da.mned mind? This episodic bull-sh¡t is just another way of selling a game that's in pre-order status! The only difference, is that you won't pay MORE for a pre-orderable game that you wait to buy until it goes gold!

Couple this middle finger with another that basically requires all players to be online just to play, even though there's no multiplayer component or other legitimate reason to justify this (and no, leader boards DO NOT qualify as one). Not only that, but there's apparently no fault tolerance WHATSOEVER, which means that if the game servers go down, the paying customers are the ones who suffer!

Congratulations, you're all a bunch of focking idiots. I hope all the people who pitched this episodic bullsh¡t and ridiculous online requirement find themselves OUT OF A JOB. 

The ONLY reason I gave a 2 instead of a 0 is because, surely, there were people who worked on this game whose efforts would have made it a great one if not for the egregious missteps above.

How HITMAN was created?:

Step 1 : Care more for anti piracy than the actual Game content
Step 2 : Use unfinished/buggy dx12, crappy dx11 engine
Step 3 : Force online mode
Step 4 : Split Game in 2 parts to make more money out of a poor built Game
Step 5 : Be Square Enix

1394,0,0.5564,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Game definitely has too little content. For the fully priced product I would expect much more missions than 6. Actually when I bought the game I thought that each episode is like mission-line in Hitman 1, where in Japan you have 4 missions in a row, but unfortunately each episode is just one mission. Of course locations are quite big and there are lots of ways to finish each mission, so if you like to replay one mission several times to find other ways to kill target then you might like it, but for me it got quickly boring, as I already knew locations of each item and missions were like walk in the park. 

Other than that game is solid Hitman experience. Maybe a bit too easy for Hitman veterans, but it's fun nonetheless."

It has a lot going for it, but in the end... it is dead easy to circumvent the mechanics and get stealthy kills by cheesing your way through the game.  The last mission was a welcome exception, due to the fact that you start with no inventory.  Rest of the game... silenced pistol and right timing works almost every time for every situation.  I don't care for beautifully crafted levels and interesting kill scenario's when there is no real need to explore them."
1396,4,0.4487,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go","Let's be honest; the developers conned all of us out of our money on launch.

This game was absolute garbage due to the fact they only gave us the Paris level after paying the £39.99 asking price so this left a bad after taste.

Overall, this is an amazing experience once you have ALL of the episodes... and if you have a really good graphics card.

A major downfall is the fact the game simply isn't optimised by the developers so it isn't stable enough for the amount for the detail within the world.

You need a high-end PC to play it. If you don't have an equivalent of a GTX 9XX series graphics card to play this game then good luck playing this in 1080p at even the lowest graphics settings.

The date of this review is 4th December 2016, and the price is STILL £39.99, and the game was released on 11th March 2016 - I do NOT recommend this game at the current asking price.

Again, it's a good game, but it's not worth the asking price due to how flawed the game engine is which is very demanding of any system.

Silent assasin had 21 missions! (I know, some are from code 47)
Contracts had 12 missions
Blood money had 13 missions
Absolution had 20 missions
Hitman has just 6...


I'm not a big fan of the episodic structure. 

Sure I could have waited for the final product to be released, but when faced with having to wait a year for that, or play it bit by bit now, obviously I went for now.

Having experienced the structure, I felt the overall game is very short and not a complete package but more a DLC purchase for the full game price.  When season two starts being released, thats another 6 levels, another 'DLC' in my eyes and essentially another £40... £80 for 12 levels!    See how this generates good profit?

They sold the game as being massive, but it's about average at best, all the levels have a lot of space but you still feel trapped in an area, and lets not forget, it's only 6 episodes, for £40,  Half a typical hitman game for the full price of a hitman game...

 I'd be happier if I paid half over all, as thats what I think it's worth having experienced it.  Thats the thing, I've now experienced the episodic structure and find that waiting so long between episodes I lose the momentum, I forget theres another level due out and dont feel particular rushed to jump back in.

Previous additions of hitman had me hooked, once I mastered a level, i'd start another level and be hooked,  I never really got to experience that with this game.

Looking to the future for Hitman, I will not be buying season 2, because thats another year of waiting for another measley 6 levels. I could wait, but then season 2 wont be released until end of 2018, and frankly it'll all be dated by then.


Silent assasin & Blood money are, still the best of the lot!

After spending close to the same amount of game time again I feel ready to rereviw this game.
Yes, server drops from time to time but now I am at least allowed to retry the connection until it works, saving a bit of frustration. The drops don't ocurr as often as they did that first day,
nor are they as severe as before (they don't last as long).
So far, level design has gotten better with each mission imo, either that or that I have gotten more used to it being not Blood Money.
That you basically reset available eqipment with every mission feels mostly okay, it somewhat forces you to aproch each mission carefully the first time or two, or just go ham and try explore as much as possible regardless of what you need to do for it.

So, do I now recommend the game, well, that is a bit difficult, I like the game but would not recommend this game without first in detail explaining the difficulties I have had with the game.
I will for now leave it as a ""No"", hoping that you reading this will be able to form your own conclusions and maybe take my words as a recommendation to buy and play this game.

Well, most of my old review regarding game still applies thou so I will leave it in whole here, incase someone else happens to get this game and get the same crap as I did my first 3.1h's.

Old:
""Seeing most reviews about server instabillity being close to half a year old, I thought that maybe the issue was less of a problem now, well... I'm wrighting this to inform any potential buyers that server instabillity is still very much a problem. I have a stable internet connection and a wide broadband, despite this of the 3.1h on record 30-40 minutes of this has been trying to get a connection with the server...
Take from this what you will.
The game in other aspects is fine, the graphics are adequate, the story (at least the part of it that I've played) is slightly above what I've come to expect (from entertainment media these days), the gameplay mechanics are solid enough and are a great step forward merging what worked from Absolution with the over all superior mechanics of Blood Money. 

TL:DR - I like the game, but it is unplayable due to server instabillity."""

1407,0,0.8208,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I've played every Hitman - I remember buying the original, and I remember how insanely difficult I found it.. No saves, easily spotted.. Very few ""set piece"" kind of kills - it was you only, and you had to be smart. It wasn't great, but its was exciting. The series quality varied over the years, but never found the sweet spot between map size, difficulty, and story. I looked forward to this new installment, as it promised a game in which you were just a hitman once again.. No nonsense story, just a simple series of contracts, and some intrigue behind it..

So what's it like? Essentially, despite the advertising, it's the same as the old one. The graphics are nice, and the big wide open spaces filled with hundreds of people are impressive, but Absolution looked nice, and had the same impressive quantity of people.. The interface is fine (although I really miss the old map), and the controls are fluent and simple. 

The problem is the gameplay; it's deteriorated (over many years) into a series of mini puzzles. You're given quite big maps, but the objectives are simple, and the targets just do their little 5 minute loop routines. How do I kill this guy? Well actually killing him isn't difficult - killing him while getting a perfect score requires a little more work, but it doesn't require any further skill. And the ways in which you kill people are so scripted now...  And usually these ways are annouced within a minute of beginning a level, by ""overhearing"" someone talking. 

It just feels so limited, and hasn't moved the game on at all. I want an mini open world, and I want to be able to really get into the character.. Even the first game used to give you a few blocks around your target! You could even ambush the target enroute if you were quick about it.. Where's the urgency? Why can't we have limited opportunities? A narrow window? Give us a game where we have to switch on and really play, rather than one where I can just press ""blend in"" and go for lunch.

But hey, I guess we're in a world where nobody wants anything new - same old shit please.

Want to be the point man for the breaching team?? Good luck getting the practice session to start. Stood around like an idiot for 10min waiting for it to start but nothing happens. Want to overload the nitro mixture? Good luck getting the icon to show up (worked on the first pass through the level but failed everytime after that). Want to smoke a rock star with his own birthday cake? Cross you finger and hope for the best, that one worked twice out of 5 attempts.

That being said, the gameplay itself isn't terrible, the negativity mostly come from how the game is packaged and sold.

[u]Always-Online[/u]
If you don't get what is so bad about always online, remember that not only do you need to be online--their servers do. The server routinely goes down for maintenance, scheduled and unscheduled, and when that happens you're forced to play in ""offline mode"". Also, there will eventually be a day when the server is taken offline for good and there's no garuntee you'll ever get to play the game again. You are not purchasing this game, you're buying temporary access to their server to play it.

[u]Offline Mode[/u]
When you can't connect to the server you can play in ""offline mode"" which is basically a different version of the game. You cannot unlock anything in offline mode and are forced to play the standard missions with the default loadout and starting locations. You will also have to replay all the missions again as progress made in online mode doesn't carry over.

[u]Elusive Targets Unavailable[/u]
Every once in a while an ""Elusive Target"" is added to the online game for a short period of time. During this time period, the elusive target has a chance of showing up in a mission and you will have one chance to assassinate them for unique bonus rewards. This sounds great but at the time of writing, 14 of these targets have been added and all 14 are no longer available. This means these unique bonus rewards are now unattainable because you didn't buy the game early enough. Sucks for you!

[u]Missions as DLC[/u]
Each mission, called an episode, is released as its own DLC that you must purchase if you want to play it. Groups of missions are clumped together into ""seasons"" which you can purchase at a slightly reduced cost. However, each season must be purchased individually as they are released. Essentially you have to pay everytime an update is made to the game if you want to play it.

Because of the above issues, I can't recommend you buy this game. However, the gameplay itself is good if you can put up with the money milking the devs and publishers are doing."

I mean, get your shit together. server maintenance in the evening where everybody winds down the day and puts in some gametime? Can't you do your server maintenance by timezones?

Gameplay: 
Well if you can't play the game there's not much to comment. The limited playtime I have been allowed was ok. Has the look and feel of previous games but this is much smoother, forces you to be more stealthy.
Also forces you to have constant internet connection.

Overall, pain in the ass."

There are ways to bypass it and even get all future DLC for free as a pirate and here I am, a legal paying customer, getting fucking shafted. It's a shame the devs put so much love into the game and effort into not repeating Absolution, it's a fucking shame I spent money on this game even with discounts, because all I've done is put money into the coffers of some guy who thinks always online stops piracy. It didn't.

Every fucking negative review is deserved.

Yes , DRM is annoying, but it's not what bothers me most about this game. It has some excellent pros, but a LOT of horrible cons that make it really far worse than BM or contracts were.

Pros : 

- Disguise system is back and improved from BM
- Plenty of ways to complete contracts
- Lots of dialogues to hear 
- Good controls 
- Good graphics
- Windows of opportunity that disappear if you're not fast enough add tension to the game.
- Voice acting is top notch (aside from the fact there aren't enough VAs) and CG cutscenes are amazing.

Cons : 

- Maps are just big for the sake of being big, and 95% of them is irrelevant fodder. BM and contracts had a LOT of interactions that were removed in HITMAN. (Carrying boxes, using cameras, more frequent use of poisons, etc)
- AI is stupid. Extremely stupid. It just goes from A to B with no subtlety , doesn't detect blood, sees bodies through walls sometimes, etc.
- Music is awful. Jesper Kyd asked to be the composer for this game and squeenix refused for some stupid reason , now you're stuck with really forgivable crappy music.
- 47 is no more the ""scary cold killer"" he used to be. Now he just does his job and his cold-bloodedness now appears as an overall lack of enthusiasm.
- Out of the 4-5 ways that are there to kill the targets , only one or two are effective/risk free in most cases.
- LACK OF CHARACTER. Seriously. The level design just feels off in absolutely every level . The maps are just full of nothing. You barely interact with your enemies anymore , and stuff is just thrown around in places you wouldn't expect.
- Opportunities are either directly pointed at or impossible to find because the maps are ridiculously fuckhuge with no good way to find your bearings other than playing them over and over and over and over again.
- Snail pacing . everything is super slow and you spend most of your time waiting for your targets.
- Everyone speaks english in every country ; completely breaks the immersion.

Neutral points : 

- If you kill anyone who's not your target , you lose a bunch of points. Going psycho killer isn't possible anymore, at least until you've perfected the mission. 
- Bunch of content , but it's non content : elusives, escalation, etc. They're litterally basic missions with less content. 

All in all my second least favorite Hitman game, absolution being the first. If you loved blood money, don't expect to relive the same thing here."

1455,2,0.3571,"online, server, always, save, connection, offline, mode, lose, connect, need","PRO: Game itself is good, map is expansive, multiple ways to complete the mission. If you are hoping to get the longevity and feel of Dishonored 2 (taking out targets non-lethally, meaningful story or sense of progression), then this game won't have it. It feels like a collection of level sandboxes that you play multiple times just to see how many ways the targets can be killed. It can be fun. Many different locales and the graphic is very good. I also did not have any technical issues so far in-game. Personally, I do not have any problem with episodic nature of this game. If any, it just feels like any other Telltale adventure game. 

CON: Let me start by saying that [b]FORCING USERS TO STAY ONLINE FOR A SINGLEPLAYER GAME IS BULL CRAP![/b] Why the dev is doing this is beyond me and I hope this practice does not continue in season 2! [u]Most of the features are locked behind online wall, with no reasons whatsoever[/u]. Nobody cares about the leaderboards, and the server connection is hit/miss. If you do want to play offline, you can, but it's main story campaign only with default starting positions, weapon loadout, and no, you cannot customize any of it. No ratings, no unlocks, no escalations, no nothing. Oh, and the saves are also separate between online/offline. This will be a big NO NO for a lot of player, including myself (yes, I received the game for free, and I'm writing this to warn potential buyers). If you plan to play offline, or do not have stable internet, stay away until they take out the always online requirement (which is silly), because you should be able to do pretty much everything I mentioned you couldn't in offline. 

Few other things:
- No effect on subsequent levels/story if you play silent assassin/mass murderer, like Blood Money
- Everywhere everyone speaks PERFECT ENGLISH, except maybe a computer in Japan, and Diana. 
- AI is quite abusable and exploitable
- Something wrong with the blood
- While I did not experience any issues, I read a lot of people experiencing technical issues, crashing, and performance problems. After half a year, I thought they'd fixed most of these, but apparently not...

I'm giving this game a NO, primarily because of the always online BS for essentially a single player game. Please be mindful of that before you purchase. I hope devs see this and take this into consideration for season 2. I will not hesitate to purchase full price season 2 if the stupid always online is taken out."

1459,0,0.3687,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","HITMAN(tm) had lots of promise, a good solid gameplay foundation and a return to the classic formula of sandbox assassination. I've had some really good times with HITMAN (tm) but I can't deny that the overall experience has been pretty negative. 

Over the last six months there have been numerous changes to the core stealth gameplay, almost all of which have ""casualised"" the game further. From removing NPCs hearing your footsteps to making them all have insane peripheral vision, the gameplay in general has gotten much worse over the course of ""season 1."" 

Some would say the counter to this is the recent addition of ""professional difficulty"", but this mode is ultimately too far on the opposite side of the scale and reintroduced several mechanics in a semi-broken state (the aforementioned NPC reactions to footsteps is one of those- it's now disguise-dependent for some reason). The inclusion of Pro Mode does show that they're listening, but it's an over correction and the duplication of all the challenges from Normal mode feels lazy. Guards still have ridiculous vision cones in either difficulty and are aimbotting auto turrets when you are detected.

There have been many minor improvements over the course of season, mainly UI-related, but the only major thing that has been changed for the better is Contracts mode (which launched without even having a search function, an appalling state compared to Absolution). Performance is still ropey, loading times could be better and glitches abound. And if you want an immersion breaker, everywhere except Japan predominantly uses the same small pool of voice actors who either sound super American or have cockney accents. 

Then of course there's needing to be signed in online at all times to be able to use unlocks, thankfully they've just patched the game so that unlocks can be earned offline. But that doesn't quite solve the problem with 200 hours invested in Online mode that are non-transferrable. The fact that a singleplayer game was practically online-exclusive for a year is ridiculous in itself. You couldn't even see your mission rating when offline. And that's another thing- your after action report is basically just how many hitman logos did I get?! The scoring system is pathetically dumbed down with no rankings outside of Silent Assassin and no detailed information outside of telling you whether you ticked off the five or so checkboxes that count towards your points. Not cash, points. Just one of dozens of features which are either compromised or outright missing from previous games. 

Couple the above with some incredible technical blunders across this first season and patches which break more than they fix, it just makes me wary of recommending this game. Which is painful, because HITMAN is a beautiful, fluid stealth experience with tonnes of options and a subtle but compeling storyline. Despite all its faults, this is probably my game of the year and there's an embarrasing amount of content here to dive into. However, IO Interactive are not some small time outfit, they should be held to a higher standard of both competency and honesty. 

This was / is an Early Access game without the sticker.

Maybe when all three seasons are out and IOI have finished dicking around with the mechanics it would be worth it and they'll have recaptured the glory days they aspire to. Hopefully by that time they'll have given up or relaxed the stupid online requirements even further as well, and may have brought the game up to feature parity with others in the same series from over a decade ago. There's just so much absent. From plate carrying, to the sniper briefcase, to human shields, VISIBLE fiber wire, or crowds actually factoring into gameplay instead of being window dressing... things we used to take for granted are simply missing. 

It's actually given me a new appreciation of Absolution's gameplay complexity in retrospect. For something that wants to be the ultimate evolution of the franchise, going so far as to drop any numbers or subtitles, there's a LOT of room for improvement. Things are definitely a lot better in some respects than they were at the start of the season, but even as a die hard Hitman fan, I'm having doubts about getting future installments. There's just too much uncertainty, with IOI patching out features over time, the overall shakiness of the service being held hostage to Square Enix's servers... even down to just what form the next ""season"" will take. Will S2 be a completely new game? An expansion pack? Second season pass with more downloadable episodes? They still aren't saying. 

Kinda epitomizes the general feeling with HITMAN (tm)... frustration."

Yes, the episodic releases suck. But, the story is captivating, I have to give the creators that.

- A return to the formula that made the series great. Open ended missions with top notch stealth mechanics allow creative solutions to eliminating your target.
- New content regularly produced be it new episodes (hears hoping for season 2) to challenges and time exclusive targets.

- There appears to be a problem with button prompts not always firing.
- The same actions will not always result in the same consequences.
- Always online DRM. This is a single player game always online just punishes people with a poor internet connection and that's assuming the servers have 100% uptime.
- Poor pricing, it's more expensive to purchase the intro pack and episodes separately than to buy the full game, punishing consumers for being informed. (may be specific to my region?)

Overall, I can't recommend Hitman, I can overlook the later two Cons but the former could be easily patched and seven months later they're still here.

The game itself appears to be pretty decent part of the HITMAN series. Nothing unusual here. However, constant problems with the badly designed copy protection makes playing too frustrating.

Because of this faulty copy protection system, I would not recommend this game for anyone. Total waste of time.

Gameplay is as good as the last one in the series, but without the irritating inability to save when you feel like it.

INCREDIBLY ANNOYING addition is 'always online gameplay'. You can play the game and beat story levels while you're 'offline', but you don't get ratings/ranking/etc. Certain game modes _require_ that you're always online and if you get booted you can't finish the level.

There seems to be a lot of content that _requires_ constant internet connection, so some of the promise of this game's features can be quickly ruined by a brief network blip.

I tried to play the story line missions, UI was completely confusing, I ended up picking a special online only game mode where you can't save or replay the mission once you start completing objectives. 

I work from home on the internet, my internet connection is baller; but for some reason I lost connection to the server and then had to quit the level completely losing all progress. I was in 'Offline' mode at that point and the UI lost most of it's content (because you can't get extra content if you're offline), then I complete the story line mission to find out at the end that I don't get any score or achievements.

Bravo.

Beat the game in 15 hours, and I took my sweet time. This felt ok since I only paid $30, but I wouldn't recommend buying at full price, I would have been upset if that was the case."

I love the Hitman series and the gameplay is solid here, but much like the new Deus Ex, its a great game that is shrouded in pesky issues. Everything about this game feels dated, the graphics, the controls, the way detection works. Especially the controls though, it feels like im playing an old 1990's RPG. There is a button action for everything, something that most games could have done with 1 or two, Hitman uses about 5. Melee combat feels dumb, hand to hand relies on quick time events, gun combat feels like im shooting people with nerf guns and you die within 2 seconds of actually being shot, you have very little time to get to cover if you are being shot at. AI feels like everyone around me are a bunch of zombies. Down to the environments, aside from the rather dated looking graphics and effects the environments have a lot of creativity behind them giving the game a lot of replayability. I occasionally drop from the servers and the game does have always online DRM. despite this I do find myself enjoying the game quite a lot. The last major issue for me is the ""episodic release"" with everything that pokes out to me like a sore thumb, requesting 60 dollars for just the first ""season"" of the game and then some for season 2 or purchasing each episode individually sounds like an overly brave request.

1517,4,0.4919,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go","I always loved Hitman, I didnt liked much absolution but it was okay.  

Sadly Square Enix or Io-interactive chosed a way I don`t like. Thats why I give a thumbs down.

Game Name:
When I preordered Hitman the store called the game ""Hitman Full Expersience"", later the name changed to Hitman Full experience Season One [Episode 1-7] and now the name after all Episode are released is HITMAN: THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON [Episode 1-6 + Bonus Episode].

It looks for me that they wanted first to sell a complete game, then determined to do a Episode One and sell Episode 2 and 3 later for the full price again. then again, they wrote you will get 7 Episodes, after the final episode was revealed, what was Episode 6, they said Episode 7 is the Bonus Mission. Hm okay, but wtf? They ask money for a short bonus mission and call them episode 7 and then cancel episode 7 and just call it Episode 1-6 + Bonus Mission? Yeah, why not, but not with me.

Gameplay:
If you played the Closed Beta and Open Beta the Prologue and Episode 1 is nothing new to you, because the prologue is the Tutorial you could play in the Open Beta and Paris was playable when they had a Closed Beta.  Episode 2-6 are new and they look realy great, but still suffer from peformance issues, bugs and glitches. The Map is okay, not realy big but also not so small, expect from the Bonus Mission. Every week or sometimes every second week they have an event called ""elusive target"", where you can kill one target, if you fail its over, you have only one try. When he is gone he is gone for ever and will not come back. If you didn´t bought the game on release you already missed 13 targets, target number 14 is live right now (19.11.2016). This targets will not come back for later, they are exclusive and you can´t chose other kills if you wish, so you have to think before you kill him, how you like to see him dead.

There is not much gameplay in my eyes, if you like games where you can do always the same just kill with other objects you may have a lot of fun, also if you like to get all achivements, else its just boring and the replay may be less. The KI is okay, a bit stupide sometimes but ok.

Graphic and Story:
the story is very short and not complete, the quality of the short cutscenes are pretty bad and only mono, if you played the beta, its the same, they never changed the intro or story to a better graphic. In Game its okay, but not much better then Absolution was. Map has a few details and a lot of objects who can be used to kill your target.

You can replay the same mission over and over just with other kills and you can load your autosave if you did a mistake, this game works only with perma online, if you don`t like to play without intenet don`t buy this game, it will not work, also when the servers got problems you will be disconnected from the mission, this was a big problem at the beginning because servers was realy bad, they still suffer sometimes.

Opinion
Buy the game on a sale, like right now with 50% off or less, I paid 15$ for my preorder on Amazon thanks to a price error and thats okay. Game makes fun but get pretty fast boring playing the same maps over and over, just with other kills. if you prefer a full game, don´t waste your time, because all you get here is a half game sold for a ""full Season one game"" and a high price. If you love achivements and you don`t have problems playing the same map 100 times its the right game. This Game feels like a Hitman Sandbox Game but not as the usuly Hitman games, also you need to be always online what would be okay if it was a multplayer but you only get a single player.  thanks to the community you can get always new targets, like it was in absolution.

49,99€ is just overpriced for 6 maps, a bad short story and a shorter Bonus map what is not a real bonus because they ask money for it and Episode 7 never was released because of the Bonus Mission."

But notably absent are the grim humor and newspaper flavor that made Blood Money what it was. Also missing is the soul.

That flaw is nailed home by the Always online restrictions. You do not own the whole game, if the servers go down all of your unlocked content goes with it. 

This is a fantastic franchise under seige by an awful publisher. Screw you Square Enix."
1521,0,0.6478,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Ok so after keeping an eye on this game for awhile, I finally decided to purchase it. I was strongly against the episodic format and did not want to purchase a game before I actually got the full product so I purchased it now that it is complete. In my opinion it is VERY overpriced considering the content, and despite my frustration with this change in the way Hitman games will be made in the future I will try my hardest NOT to turn this review into bickering and complaining about selfish publishers or greedy devs or whatever.

There are 6 levels, each one takes about 30min TOPS to complete. Thankfully its the Hitman game you remember, like how Blood Money was. Creative kills, in the form of ""opportunities."" These provide numerous different ways to complete the missions and take out the targets and they are all unique and fun. However even playing each level NUMEROUS times, the game loses its appeal very quickly and the ""contracts"" mode just wasnt fun for me. Once you play a level more than twice, you know it like the back of your hand and it just loses its appeal and ability to hold your attention. You know where all the secret paths are, all the guards and their patrol routes, you know where all the disguises and items like rat poison and exploration is officially dead at this point, so is seeing anything new that you havent already.

The story is interesting, Burnwood is HOT! Sexy video game character, and the dynamic she has with 47 is interesting as well, they sort of care for eachother despite their extremely emotionally disconnected work relationship. The story involves some illuminati puppet master conspiracy sort of thing, which works, and the characters are all pretty decent and have EXCELLENT voice acting. But so little is dribbled in with each mission you complete, its hard to feel invested in the story when the story consists of a 60 second video before and after each mission, and thats it. 

Overall I cannot recommend this game, I paid $60 and am highly dissapointed and I can confidently say despite my long standing appreciation for Hitman games, I will NOT be purchasing the next ""season."" I dont know how in this day and age, in the video game industry, things are going backwards... I mean the previous Hitman games were all longer than this, and with these games getting more and more advanced and larger and larger file sizes (60gb!!) youd think they would get longer and bigger, but apparantly not. The Hitman games are getting shorter it seems. And I just cannot justify spending $60 for 6 missions which provide a meager 20ish hours of fun. And unfortunately its the kind of game where when your done playing it, your DONE. And are unlikely to pick it up again. Illusive contracts were supposed to counter this but they are too sporadic and far apart. 

Despite all Ive said I did enjoy the game quite a bit, and it was an exhilarating albeit short journey. Nothing beats that rush you get when your dragging a body down a hallway, rushing to jam it into a container to conceal it while an NPC approaches. Or sneaking in a restricted area evading armed guards. The game is difficult so no more mass murder fests like in Blood Money, and no more M4s with Drum magazines. And I appreciate this because you cant just get lazy and shoot everyone, you need to really think and plan your moves. Very limited weapon selection and they dont feel badass like they did in Blood Money. No more suitcase sniper rifle which I think is RIDICULOUS! That was my favorite part of Hitman, and since snipers are not concealable you can kiss sniper kills goodbye, and its impossible to reach vantage points without alerting a dozen NPCs along the way.

TLDR: Too expensive, wait for a sale."

The levels are very well made, there is a ton of freedom and multiple ways to eliminate your targets and the audiovisuals do a good job, so I don't have any problem with those parts. 

The problem, however, is that the solid level design is expected to carry the game alone, while terrible decisions regarding other aspects weigh it down almost every step of the way.

It feels like yet another skeleton of a great game that had the engine stripped down to work on consoles and then dumbed down for a ""wider audience"", hereby alienating both core Hitman fans and PC gamers. And here I thought these two were your primary demographic.

Here are some bullet points off the top of my head:
[list][*]Every time you boot up the game, there will be this unskippable message: ""HITMAN WAS DESIGNED BY A MULTICULTURAL STUDIO WHERE STAFF IS OF VARIED ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS"". You'll then learn that there are no difficulty options. Savescumming is completely unlimited, and even encouraged by tooltips. Everyone is a winner, let's all hold hands and sing cumbayah. Hey kids, [b]you[/b] can play Hitman too! Here are some tooltips that will make the game basically play itself. Scores? Everyone gets the same score! Accident kills or shotguns to the chest, same score! I think you see where this is going.

[*]My biggest gripe is that there is no difficulty setting. You can disable psychic powers, seeing through walls, slowing down time and tooltips that hold your hand throughout the game, but this will not affect your score in any way. This is unacceptable for a Hitman game.

[*]Your score is not accessible at all during gameplay. If you get spotted, you often won't even notice, or be able to find out until the mission is over. The only way to check your score is to finish the mission. Even then, the scoreboard is minimalistic at best. Despite its' many other faults, Hitman Absolution (2012) did this exceptionally well.

[*]The preparation and equipment still pales in comparison to Blood Money (2006). There are no newspaper headlines  either. What is new, is the ability to start at predetermined checkpoints (such as starting in the kitchen with a cook disguise), but only if you already completed the mission.

[*]Explosion kills of any kind all count as ""accident kills"". This makes it very easy to cheese, but it doesn't matter since there is no such thing as a ""signature kill"" or ""accident kill"" anymore. The score for genius environmental kills or just clicking on someone with a shotgun are the same. They give you more level points, but all that does is unlock new starting locations and starting disguises.

[*]There is no penalty for savescumming. The tooltips even encourage it. 

[*]Some of the stealth mechanics are sloppy and too easy to cheese. There are no difficulty options to reduce their effectiveness. 

[*]The story and characters aren't bad, but they won't blow your socks off. Let's just say they're interesting when acting naturally during gameplay, and boring in the cutscenes.

[*]Releasing the game in episodes may be convenient for the developer, but it certainly isn't for the consumer. They've shot themselves in the foot by failing to explain it properly as well. It is, however, the consumer's fault, for enabling this kind of behaviour with preorder culture, and it is lowering the quality of games in all genres. I won't go as far as calling it beta-testing for money, though, since they are well-designed and have a lot of attention to detail once actually released.

[*]Selling the first level is not the way to go, that's what a [b]demo[/b] is for. The game is already expensive as is, and the high price for individual levels is terrible value for money. Additionally, if you buy individual levels and decide to buy the full game, you will be stuck paying for them again since it's a bundle. A big fuck you to the consumer. 

[*]If you liked the first season (7 levels for 40-60$), then you will love the next one. Be sure to drop 40-60$ for the next batch.[/list]

It's not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, don't get me wrong. The levels are great. Everything else about it, however, is sub-par. I loved the little things, but the big picture is a mess.

The potential is there, but they absolutely have to solve some of the issues I mentioned above. Just introduce difficulty options, fix the scoring system and wait for the price to drop. How hard is that? I won't even mention the sales strategy.

Until they address these points, I'll reluctantly say that Hitman: Absolution was more enjoyable, though I'm sure 90% of you will disagree with me. If you are looking for good a stealth game, I would recommend you get Hitman: Blood Money, MGS5: Phantom Pain or the Batman games. All of them bundled together are likely to cost around the same as this title alone."

Especially the first 4 eps where I found myself following almost identical methods since some certain tools in this game were just to powerful and easy to use.

Another complain would be the lack of immersive feelings. The game has great graphics and soundtracks, but when the NPCs talk, everything falls back to the ground. The game was trying to create a experience of a real hitman that receives assignments and goes all over the world for assassination, but that was totally ruined by the accent-free English sopken by the NPCs. The only time that this didn't feel strange was ep5 when the mission actually happens in America, while the worst case was in ep6, where the story took place in Japan, and everyone in the game speaks Japanese with American accent. I really hope a game with budget like such have done a better job on this.

So far season 1 has came to an end, with not a lot going on in the story I'd say. Hopefully the compelete would at least tell a solid story. I hate to say this but I regret to have bought the game right when ep1 came out."

So, I thought I give this one a shot, and yeah, I liked it, despite its terrible performance and non-existent optimization, at least for nVidia User like me. I even bought the cat in the bag, the full experience after I played Sapienza, and that was kinda a mistake. Sapienza is just great, what a playground, to kill in so many different ways, I play'd this level like 20 times. Then the quality slowly decreased with the locations that followed. Every one was smaller, less ways to kill, and less diverse ways. It kinda felt all the same to me..so, if you wanna get it, get at least Sapienza, and leave the rest, imho I like Colorado and Japan, maybe get them as well..and story? what story?!?

Just to be clear - not only they released the game in parts and we had to wait for each, they did not even bother with tighting up the plot twists. My advice? Do not buy this game.

Even with that said though, I do not recommend this game.
The always online DRM is a huge annoyance. If you lose connection for even an instant you are kicked from your current mission and have to restart.
This feels annoying and pointless. They want to stop piracy, so they add a feature that annoys all users everytime they lose connection.

The game is episodic, which I personally don't enjoy. This is not objective, this is subjective and only my opinion.
I don't like episodic. I could not play this entire game when it came out a very long time ago. I could only play a small portion.
Because of this, I lost interest. I don't care to play more now that a lot more is out, it's just a pain to keep up with the game.
Most gamers I feel agree with me in that they will play a game over a month or any short period of time and then move on.
Not many gamers will keep coming back to one game for months to years on end aside from with very specific games like mmo's which this isn't.

If you really like the Hitman formula I think you should buy the 10 dollar intro pack and try it. The intro pack gives you a great idea of what the game is.
If you like the intro pack and want to play a lot more, buy the whole game. You won't regret it if you enjoyed the intro pack. That is my advice if you do buy it."

Overall, I felt that this game is a step down from Absolution.  Absolution even with its weird story has more levels than this one and more replay value. For $60, I felt that this game should at least has like 8 maps minimum with some plot in the mission not just prologue and end scene,"

You seem to ""level up"" (I assume, since I can't stay connected long enough to really be sure, and losing connection kicks you out mid-game) by completing missions which unlocks new features such as extra entry points into a mission, new supply drop-off points, and different starting weapon options.

Great level design, good combat, and gameplay, reminds me of the older games like blood money. 

Also the obligation to have an always-online connection to get the mastery leveling, in game achviments, new ways to get the targets in more intersting ways. That's just  cheap in my opinion. Also not to mention it was episodic. Like seriously? Is this a talltell games where I get to.. oh wait. I took my time and waited for the all the episodes to be avalibe so that I would play it all at once. 
And a good thing i did. Because to be absolutely honest. I wasnt remotely intersted in what these elusive targets are for the most part its just more poeple for me to kill. Like if i wanted more Hitman I just would play the normal Hitman game and try to discover more intersting and devilish ways the divs gave me to get to my missions. Like some of the namings of the missions are funny I'll give them credit for that.

When it came to story telling It's not an hitman:Absolution I give you that. and sadly things wont start to make sense until you get to the final episode. And even then It's still felt dissapointing, and incomplete.
I wanted more story like what I got in Absolution. That gave me suspeness, it also made me felt deprived of all hope. Sounds alot better than ""Hello Mr 47 go and kill these poelpe, plz.""

Now that IO is back on the menu. I feel this game will start heading in the right direction. 

I support IO interactive & I love the hitman games.

That was, until they sold me a ""trilogy"" and only allow me to buy 2/3 titles.

This was an incredibly forceful and unfair move. Alienating most PC customers who supported IOI in a uncertain time. 

The Epic Game Store is more negative than positive. Regardless of intention, at this point it has done more harm than good. 

The problem is not the EPIC GAME Store, it is the people who own it, the biggest ‘video games company in the world’; Tencent. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent

Tencent is very tightly linked with the central government of the People's Republic of China. Tencent is a company spreading influence of the chinese government and using spyware to spy on its users. This includes companies Tencent has claimed over, companies like Ubisoft, Battlestate games, Riot Games & the Epic Game Store, just to name a few. 

I cannot support any human being, let alone brand or company that would be so morally bankrupt as to accept money from an appendage of the central government of the People's Republic of China. 

An institution infamous for violating the human rights and right to life of its and other countries citizens. How deplorable and ulgy of a company to do such a thing. 


You, the customer, a fellow human being, have a responsibility to your fellow man not to assist in their suffering indirectly by supporting the chinese government. If a Developer or publisher is supporting the murderous chinese government, do not support them, or you will have blood on your hands. Add them to a black list, as many of us are doing, let them use their blood money to make mediocre video games, don’t participate in it. 

If you decide to indulge anyway, as a human being, knowing you are supporting the murder and suppression of others, you are a monster, truely. I have no pity for you. I pray one day you get better guidance, and don’t continue a life of suffering and mindless consumption.

People deserve better than what is happening to the PC market right now, to video games right now, to people's well being. 

Do the right thing, be a decent human being. Don’t indirectly murder people by funding their assailants. Its repugnant.

The online DRM is nonense, this game is entirely single player. The online aspect is included only to discourage piracy. My internet connection basically never goes down, but Hitmans servers do, sometimes at the worst of times or for no reason at all. 

When this happens all progress is lost, and the game kicks me out. This is a single player game, they're ruining the experince in the hope some pirate will be forced to buy it. The game does have a solid autosave and manual save system which helps, but I still don't like this. 

Gameplay wise, the game is great, it's a return to the open ended style of the older Pre-absolution games.. Blood money namely, where there is a focus on non-linear creative assasinations. 

Pros:Graphics are good, not ground breaking but they work. 
Enviroments are well designed,very detailed and ""lived in"" and the amount of NPCs in some of the levels is very impressive. 

Each level has many many ways to solve it, and there's always a way to get out of trouble if you haven't gotten yourself into truly unrecoverble situations.  The ways vary from straight up murder with a sniper rifle, pistol or any number of direct assault methods, to more elebatorate accidents. Among other things.  Unlike Absolution you will die if you try and shoot your way out, gun fights are dangerous. 

The AI is, accetable. They will work together and are fairly observant compared to some stealth games, but as always they are easily defeatable when you learn the patterns. 


Cons: The voice acting has almost zero vartiation. The Asian guards in Thailand sound like some Marines from America. This is a small thing, but for some reason it is noticable to me because of the detail of the enviroemtns, it sticks out as odd. They could do with some accents and variation. 

Online DRM, it is useless, locks you out of content if you happen to want to play online and is a failure point for the game when the publishers decide to drop it. It is a terrible practice that needs to be shamed out of existence.

The game doesn't run very well. I have aging but still competent hardware and while it's accetable it runs fairly poorly with frequent frame dips. It is playable for me on near max settings, but it could be better, and the sheer amount of NPCs rendered makes up for that slightly. 

The music is average, it just seems there to fill the silence, rather than to add to the game atmosphere for the most part. It's alright, generic. That's fairly subjective though. 



I have enjoyed my time with the game, the gameplay is good, and unlike Absolution, it's a good Hitman game, but I don't suggest buying it for these reasons unless you're really commited to the Hitman franchise. If you do buy it, make sure to be ok with always online.

EDIT: This review has gotten more attention than I anticpated, so I decided to add a little info about the DRM.

Hitmans DRM works by tying your progress to their online servers, you CAN play the game offline, but you can not continue a save that was made while online, and while offline you also lose access to all unlocks, and from what I understand but I'm not certain, you can unlock the items, but the online and offline saves will be treated seperatly. 

In my opinion, while I love the game, this is unnecetable, this is blatant potentially intrusive DRM that is presented as a feature, and while the devs have done an excellent job with the game otherwise, whoever made that marketing decision made a mistake. 

The only reason I don't reccomend this game is because of this DRM."

Seems rather fucking incomplete to me if I can't play the content I bought. 

Time gated content in a single player game. Creme dela creme of scummy. Don't purchase expecting to do the special missions if you have a job that's demanding and you have little time. 

To be fair the game it's self is well done and incredibly fun. It's solid, done right, and everything I've watched on the elussive target missions seem like they are amazing.

Square released this as ""episodic"", meaning you have to wait until they release each chapter of the game. Okay, I guess. I mean, I've pre-ordered and done ""Early Access"" stuff before. This, however, wasn't labelled technically as early access but rather a full game. The story is uncompelling and the missions feel rather forgetable compared to the others. Sure, there's lots of replayability stuff, but this has 6 missions and they're short. After Episode 5 I'm at 17 hours, and that's having done several missions multiple ways. They tried to do some stuff with ""Elusive Targets"", all it is is putting NPCs in places that already were setup. It's still not hard, and after you've gone through a mission once, it's pretty easy to complete the next one on the same level in like 30 minutes tops. The difficulty just isn't there for me and the size of the maps doesn't feel like it's something that was worth waiting for in the end, it's not really any bigger than any other Hitman game. It just doesn't feel fresh and even after Episode 5, the game just feels way too short. I feel like I paid to wait, and as of Episode 5, I'm still waiting on something interesting to come out of this game.

Also, mod-locked and online only, for what? It has player generated missions and leaderboards, all of which are pretty underwhelming for the average player and for me didn't add any value to my experience."

When the game was announced, they said they would release an episode every month for a year. I assumed 12 episodes because of this, but was extremely skeptical that they could maintain this timeline and so I was prepared to be disappointed. You heard nothing on the number of episodes until well after the game had released, and we were informed of this by the developer randomly changing it on the store page. 

The game is extremely thin for what you pay, and although it has extra content like elusive targets, these are entirely useless if you travel, have a life, or did not buy this game on day one. as they are only available for 48 hours after release and only appear once every few weeks. The story is almost non-existent in the game, effectively making it a 7 mission Hitman tech demo. They have announced an additional 2 seasons, at an additional 60 bucks a pop, so to see this barely coherent story flesh out, you'll have to pay a total of 180 dollars and wait two additional years. None of this information was available on release, and was not announced until well after Episode 5.

They knew the fans wanted a return to blood money style missions, but they have absolutely no clue how to flesh out a story over this format and thus, have turned the game the game into nothing but a money grabbing tech demo intent on exploiting the nostalgia from the last time they made a decent hitman game.

So as you can see by looking at the system requirements, RAM satisfied, processor satisfied, and GPU slightly over the one for recommended settings. The game autosets the game options for low for me on everything. Fuck that. My rig handled Deus Ex MD and the Witcher 3 on Very High, so I set it to very high.

No problem. Game looks great, no hickups at all. I reach the second stage, Paris, but don't start playing it, have to sleep. 

Second 2:
 Start the Paris stage, game crashes while loading the stage. Second try, game freezes seconds after loading stage. 3rd try, lower settings, game is playable for 5 minutes, crashes my sound card, have to do hard reset. Give up for the day. I have not had any problems like this with any game in 3 years. 

Day 3:
Lower the settings to default,, low shadows, low texture quality, what can be off is off. Game crashes on loading, crashes my sound card, have to restart. 2nd try, game starts loading the stage, game freezes and I have to do a hard reset.

 THIS IS WHILE PLAYING ON THE MINIMUM SETTINGS ON A RIG THAT RUNS THE WITHER 3 ON ALMOST ULTRA!!!!

I just put my kids to bed and managed to play for an hour before going to bed. I sneaked through a dozen guards to achieve one of my final challenges on the level. And then: bam. Hitman Servers are offline, thanks for waiting.  

Whe worst part is that online does not add anything else in value (other than a leaderboard) since it's a single player game.  Also worries me what happens if I want to play in one year and they have decided to take down most servers by then.

Loved Blood Money.
Liked Absolution, though I felt it was too easy to get detected in missions by people with same costume that it rendered disguises almost useless.

Now in this they sort of fixed problems with Absolution, yet they took some of the new functionality that they had put into hitman with absolution that made it more fun. Like the Point shooting where you can set points on people to shoot at before letting loose a barrage of bullets, it was a fun way to feel like a really good marksman. This game is ALL just following marks, trying to find random ways to kill them, and its got a feeling of slowness and dullness. NEVER pull out a gun. guns are useless. Even a silenced pistol will alert guards from miles away and even if you're nowhere near the crime when they come by you, even if your gun is concealed now, and noone saw you do anything, suddenly they randomlly start firing at you and magically know you did it. Its game breaking how badlyl designed this shit is. 

I could understand some of the complaints with Absolution...but its like they not only took away those new features in Absolution while getting rid of some of the downsides, but also made it WORSE than the original Hitman games. It feels even more clunky and slower paced than the older hitman games. Its just sad really what they did with this franchise.

Bought first pack, bought Sapienza, and now, i'm warning you all about this: STAY AWAY.

Not only will you not like it if you like Absolution, you won't like it if you like ANY Hitman game. The most gimped and shitty Hitman experience ever.

Basically, pre-ordered the entire hitman experience believing there would be more than 6-7 locations/level. In absolution there were 21+ missions, all on different levels. Here we have 6-7.... Yes the graphics are more memory intensive.... so what? Yes the elusive targets are fun, due to the pressure factor of it being timed, no capability to save or turn back after the assassination, and simply more content. But those will no longer be available once played, never live anyways. Everything else is boring repetative junk. Mastering each level entails more start locations and smuggled item locations... thats it as far as that goes. I've never been interested in trying the escalation missions, being that they seem repetatively boring. The two summer bonus episodes were junk, I haven't even cared to complete them. This recent episode in colorado had 4 targets and an extra mission to complete, and it was easy as pie, completing it in less than 30 minutes. Overall it is truely a repetative borefest. As soon as the elusive targets are no longer live, the game will be boring to me.

As most other negative reviews probably discuss, the missions are way too few to call this a complete game. Even though the mission maps themselves are often larger than in the earlier games, they feel bland to me, and the missions objectives in each of them is no more than before, thus the time you spend to complete each mission is not significantly larger than before, meaning that the missions are played through in a breeze.

What I perhaps miss the most from Blood Money, (even the horrendous Absolution), is that the levels in those games contain a lot of hidden things to find in off-the-beaten-path rooms and sometimes humorous dialog between guards. It is hard to explain, but I feel that the levels in Hitman (2016) lack any of this at all, and feel like sterile areas run by a strict government or something. I have thoroughly checked every room in the levels so far, and found very few things of interest.

A lot of angry discussions in the message boards are of the two camps: achievement replayers vs story/silent assassin people. I am in the latter camp, and grinding my way through the same level a hundred times is not for me. Thus, I cannot give this game a good score. The story has also been disappointingly confusing and uninteresting thus far, but I admit that the Hitman games have never really been about the story, even though there is an interesting core framing around most of the earlier releases.

The levels are large and detailed and have many available options to assassinate an enemy and the story is interesing and well written.  Unfortunatly, all of that is overwritten by the utter lack of content.  once you beat the story the rest of the time you is spent replaying the same map attempting assassination challenges or escalation missions.

 The ""challenges"" are a joke, as most of them are unlocked by simply escaping the map a certain way, or choosing a different starting location within the map (completeing challenges unlocks more starting locations. Starting at the new location is a challenge unlock in and of itself, completing the loop of why fucking bother.)  

The escalation missions are more or less boring as they have nothing to do with the game, map, or story. The escalation missions require you to assassinate various nobodies on the maps you already completed for the story. Then once you kill that person, you can play the the escalation mission again, and again, and again.... 5 times for each escalation 'mission"" (i shouldnt even really call them missions as they are a joke) Each time you complete an escalation mission, the difficulty ""escalates"", allowing you to replay that mission but with a different tweaks like using a certain disguise, assassinating them a certain way, or adding more people to assassinate.  I understand that the gameplay is based on assassinating people and finding new ways to do it.  But after playing the same map 40 times just to get the achievement or challenge unlocked, you're sick of the map.  You're sick of the game.  You get sick of assassinating a bunch of nobody's at the same damn party with the same damn ways with the same damn goals.

The DirectX 12 problems didn't occur in the first two episodes for me, so I reached 7 hours of playtime - and guess what? Can't refund it anymore now.

Worst hitman ever created.
There will be, in practice, less than 10 missions, because the game is ""under construction"" and being released at turtle speed.
No story connecting the missions, just shuffle contracts, who, by the beginning, looked like would have some sort of connection.

Playability?
Good, it's a mature franchise and we expected nothing less than this.
Optional killings are fun, including the hints by transeunts, but... The lack of story and a decent soundtrack makes it worthless.

Oh, Jasper Kyd, how much u r missed!

This were a story type franchise, and in the rush to make it ""present something new"" it ended up looking more a MMORPG, with people competing to attend the unique events, who, in the mind of creators, would fulfill the emptiness of the game.

Bad:
- Always online for a single player game... wtf
- This release a level bullshit is awful and I truly feel bad for the people who miss out on things and have to pay more money if they did it piecemeal style
- Controls somehow got worse instead of better, especially while creeping around
- No game difficulty setting (that I saw)
- Interface built by a sub-human... aka not optimized for PC by the looks of it
- No quicksave button... seriously?
- Graphics don't feel as immersive as absolution did
- Waypoint markers for key items... They should all just show up like a square when close, not be trackable in my opinion. Being able to see with instinct is already more then enough hand holding.

I can't take the characters seriously when I'm getting yelled at by an Arab who is calling me a jackass like some middle aged white American.

1679,0,0.6351,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Q: What exactly is the ""live component"" of HITMAN?  
A: It covers many things. Get ready for a long read.

Elusive Targets
The Contracts that are available for a limited-time are what we call Elusive Targets. An Elusive Target is the closest thing to the Hitman fantasy that we've ever created. These targets will be custom-created characters that are added to existing locations and are only there for a limited time in real-time. You'll only have one chance to take them down. If they escape, they are gone for good. If you kill them, that's the way that you killed them. There are no do-overs and no second chances. When an Elusive Target leaves the game world (one way or another) they never return.
Each Elusive Target will have a custom briefing video, a backstory and a unique reason for being in that location. When you're actually playing in the location, the Elusive Target will not appear on the map and will not appear in Instinct. In order to find them, you'll need to use clues from the briefing video and a photograph that you will be able to review. You'll need to explore, find your target, learn their patterns and come up with a plan to eliminate them - all whilst playing. The pressure will be on when you've got the target in your sights. If you miss the shot and chaos breaks loose, you will need to have a plan B, because the save-game is disabled during an Elusive Target. If you kill the wrong person or die when trying to exfiltrate, that's it. Game over, the target escapes.
As the season unfolds, you’ll earn in-game rewards for completing multiple Elusive Target contracts. The rewards are signature suits from previous Hitman games and versions of those suits with gloves. There’s also a version of the signature suit from the new HITMAN with gloves.

We know that Elusive Targets are not going to be easy, they were designed that way.  
 
Escalation Mode  
Escalation Mode is something else completely new for HITMAN and was created as a way to regularly provide a fresh challenge to players. You'll need to master the location as well as the gameplay mechanics to complete a hit that will escalate in difficulty by adding new elements. As an example, the first stage could be to eliminate your target with a sabre. Then, the second stage could be to eliminate your target with a sabre whilst dressed as a waiter and removing any security camera recordings within two minutes. We are able to change where the security cameras are and also add additional ‘security’ measures to the locations, such as laser trip-wire explosives that you’ll need to avoid.
Escalation Mode has a strong focus on having fun with the game mechanics and mixing them up – pretty much anything goes in this mode. It’s more about being playful than realistic. For each Escalation Contract, there are five stages and you're free to replay them as you wish to climb the leaderboards. As with Elusive Targets, the save-game functions are disabled.
All Escalation contracts and Elusive Targets are created by IOI and will be released between the location releases as part of the live content.
 
Contracts Mode  
On top of those new features, we also have Contracts Mode. You'll know this from Absolution. Play-to-create, mark your own targets, choose how to kill them and compete against your friends. IOI will also pick the best of the bunch and put them in the Featured Contracts list so you've got something fresh to play whenever you load up the game.
 
Live Challenges  
Additionally, we have the ambition of adding community-inspired challenges into the game. As you'll have seen from the recent Beta period, the game is full of challenges you can complete to prove your mastery of a location. We are looking into creating new challenges that we can periodically add to the game. These challenges will be an homage to some of the more elaborate, amusing, difficult or creative feats that we see our players complete. As an example, one of the first ‘live challenges’ we are looking at creating is called “Hammer Time” and was inspired by a ‘2AngryGamers’ livestream of our PS4 Beta, where they used only a hammer to knock out almost every guard in the ‘Final Test’.
At this stage, Community-inspired challenges (or whatever we actually decide to name them) are just one of the ideas we are working on to keep the game fresh and live as we go through the season. These are not a guaranteed feature but something we’re testing and trying out.
 
All of those things are part of the live component of HITMAN. We'll be watching and listening to what you do in our game world and want to shape that world to what you've already done in it."

in an attempt to create different pathways to your targets there's these opportunity moments you can, as the word puts it, oppertune from. nice and fine you say, no not really. the mechanic works as such, you eaves drop on a conversation of interest, that will allow you to use a mechanic or a disguise to eliminate or get close enough to eliminate your target. this seems fine and well, if you turn off the hints that is, and by hints they mean big neon signs with a roadmap to murder while it panders you a reach around. so you turn off the hints. you eaves drop the conversation again, you find that the same conversation (part A), after listening to it carefully, has not an inclination as to where you might find (part B) of the opportunity, you run around like a chicken with its head cut off and find part B after 30 minutes of search overhearing every american/british conversation, in Morroco/italy/spain? during this 30 minutes you realise you you couldve just shot the target 30 different times, but no you must assasinate this man with a quirky and most unfortunante accident so you can unlock this shotgun youre never going to use, practically... and that will be your experience, from beginning to end."

The bloodmoney experience. Good levels, even if you could nickpick a few things.

Bad:
Offline mode: no unlocks, you always start at the same location, the same bad pistol, no poisons. 

ADDED: Patches made that game worse in some places:
1. Only 1 Camerasystem needs to be disabled to disable all cameras on the map(Sapienza has 3 systems,one at a church, a mansion and a secret underground lab. Makes no sense)
2. Some conversations are now considered private, so you are not allowed to be seen.Even if they stand in a large group and everybody else can hear them.


Server for germany not very stable, 3 discounects in 1 month. 

Loading all your unlocks takes a lot of time now.

Elusive Targets, Contracts mode: Modding would had been better, these things don't add anything. They didn't put much work into these.
Update: Wow, elusive targets are so pointless and not fun, after 20 targets now its painfully obvious. No backstories, no chatter, just targets at new locations on old maps....

If the company dies or the developer is shut down(Square Enix did this stuff before), ""your"" game is gone....
Update: could happen anytime now after Squareenix wants to get rid of IO Interactive :(



So all in all, if it wasn't always online, it could have been a good game. But the issues around the game kill it.


Update: new professional difficulty is bad and lazy: It lets you earn master points by doing the same opportunities like before, with more guards and more cameras, to get a reskin of weapons with one exception. One new gun added for bankkok. 
There are only little twists now on these old maps, like replaced some items and sealed of escape routes. 
Only good thing is cameras now are watched on most levels so running in front of one with a gun drawn raises suspicion. like in Bloodmoney :)"

Game feels like it wants so badly to emulate Blood Money, and according to multiple sources from Io Interactive, this was the direction they wanted to do--more mission-centric, more ways to get to places, more focus on the mission-by-mission pacing that Blood Money and it's predecessors did well. It does these things, not extremely well, but it does work. 

Nothing else does though. If you're not doing everything exactly in the way they (Io Interactive) planned it, you're fucked. You have less health, less tools, no customizability, and less ""hard rules"", as in, guard will walk to A, and back to B after 20 seconds, etc. I'm not opposed to this series having more mutability in what NPC's do, but this game feels..shoddy, like compared to Blood Money, it's balsa compared to treated oak. It's flimsy. You can complete the game, eventually, but the online component can literally destroy 2+ hours you've spent in a single mission trying to perfect it ad get that Silent Assassin rating.

There are now 5 episodes which does mean they released one a month, congratulations. Episode 3 was okay, didn't play it much because I got bored quick. Episode 4 was absolutely awesome, but they failed on episode 5. Episode 5 is said to be located in Colorado, but I do not see one thing that reminds me of the States, instead they should've done something more fun like New York or Las Vegas where the map would involve much more than just targets and mean dudes.

Episode 6 is said to be located in Japan, but with episode 5 out I feel like they will mess up and have some winter climate. Dumb and money whore devs....

Every couple seconds to 5 mins the game disconnects me from the servers which either forces me to retry or even kicks me straight to the menu. It's a single player game, I really don't understand the need to check the servers every second. If high scores vs cheaters is such a problem, have this work on a competition mode or something. I dont give a F about leaderboards. I just want to play the game content.

This mechanic makes the game nearly unplayable which is a shame because... under all of this, it's an amazing game. I'm a big hitman fan and I would even say this trumps blood money... if the server connection issue was removed. Playing offline sucks because you dont get any of the items you unlocked from playing. It limits you from replayability because the items you get give you more options to assasinate which when working is great fun!

The escalations and elusive targets are great fun as well. That is when you're not trying to connect to the servers constantly.

Whilst I enjoy the game at the minute, for what it is, considering that a majority of the content has yet to be delivered into the domains of the mass market, I do not agree with some of the business decisions which have been made by IOI.  Namely, to give the bonus missions to owners of ""The Full Experience pack"", and ""Upgrade Pack"", but not to people who have purchased ""The Starter Pack"", which means that the consumers of ""The Starter Pack"" either have to refund content, or purchase ""The Upgrade Pack"", which in turn means that they have to spend even more money in that instance and have to purchase content that they may already own a copy of, in order to unlock the extra content.

Furthermore, this decision has driven a dividing line between the members of the community, which now feels like a hostile environment resulting in community members being at each others throats when we should all be working together, for the common good.  I cannot help but feel that IO Interactive should have focused on solving issues such as equality, on creating a sense of community, and shared values, for the greater good of both the community, the product, and the business rather than putting barriers such as this in place, which is what they have done, however inadvertently or otherwise, by making this decision.  

In that sense, I can recommend Hitman, but I cannot recommend IO Interactive, so I am torn between what to do, since, by default, if I support Hitman, I support IO Interactive and their, to be frank, rather idiotic business decisions, since neither entity can be extrapolated from the other.

Finally, I have found that Hitman is a solid product, despite containing DRM, and the game itself performs admirably, for me at least.  The levels are enjoyable, whilst at the same time being quite vibrant and quite large.  However, I feel that the business has made a bad decision in the marketing of this product and how it, and the business, relates to the customer.

Graphic is nice, totally next gen quality, game is very newbie-friendly ( a lot of hand holdings ), however gameplay is just OK, always-online DRM is wayyy over the top, and the way Squeenix/IO Interactive do business is intolerable.

[b]Lets start with the intolerable part.[/b] HITMAN is literally a tripe-A early access game, released in episodic fashion. Knowing people would be hesitant to pay 60$ up front for an unfinished product, combined with the fact that the previous Hitman game didn't give fans a lot of faith, SQ/IOI introduced a way to buy the game by piece, each piece equals a released location, and promised additional contents for those locations as the game develops, with no extra DLC planned. Yet 4 months later, they introduced some above-average contents for existing locations, however only allows people who paid 60$ up front to play with it. The rest will have to wait until after the whole game is out to [b]buy[/b] it, AKA they won't receive these totally-not-a-DLC contents for free. People who chose to buy episodes separately already committed to paying more than the full buy users in the long run ( 65$ vs 60$ ) and now they'll have to pay even more for those [i]bonus[/i] contents. In the end this is an episodic game that punishes episodically buyers, and they did that without any warnings beforehand. 

[b]Now for the DRM.[/b] To make up for the lack of fresh locations ( only 6 locations, so about half the amount in previous Hitman games ), IOI made the maps much bigger, with many ways to complete your tasks. As you discover more ways to finish your contracts, more unlocks will be available in that map ( i.e more starting locations, weapons caches,.. ). However all unlocks are tied to your Squeenix account, and as soon as you're offline you'll lose access to all of it. If you're playing and lose connection to SQ server then you're kicked back to main menu. Offline mode means a mission always start the same way.

Moreover, when you're online the game auto saves very often, and randomly. Those auto save are again stored in SQ server, and when it's autosaving ( takes about 1 to 2 minute in my case ), you [b]can't[/b] trigger a manual save, and have to wait until the game finished uploading to the cloud. Same case for when you want to load a save, there's a long delay for the game to fetch autosaves down. And when it's fetching there's a very high chance to lose connection, then you are kicked back to the main menu. Bye bye progress.

[b]Gameplay is a big step down from previous Hitman games, Absolution included.[/b] Bigger map, more opportunities, yes, but most of those key events are scripted, you have to approach the location to actually ""trigger"" it, instead of ""mind your own business"" attitude in previous games. This creates a linear feeling inside a semi-open environment. Many mechanics seen in previous games are missing here. No bloodstains, no sniper case, no peeking keyholes, just to name a few. More hand holdings are included, and updates that were supposed to improve the mechanics made questionable decisions. For example in episode 2, the town of Sapienza includes a beach, a church, a town square, a mansion, plus many alleys and tunnels. It makes sense to have multiple security camera systems operating in the town, however a recent update ""connected"" all those systems, which means you only have to tamper one system to have every cameras in the town to be nullified. And did I mention that there are nobody observing those security screens ever? Overall it's still fun and enjoyable, but if you were a fan of Hitman games a decade ago you'd see a lack of depth here.

Graphics seem to be the saving grace here. It looks nice both at low and high settings, and the world can be very vivid with settings cranked up ( not the first map though, it's obvious that a Paris high-fashion event isn't mean to be colorful ). Game supports DX12, and it does look better on DX12 while require less GPU power, however there are still occasional crashes here and there when DX12 is used.

Sound is ok, it's not a big attraction point after all.

Overall, unless you've taken a great interest in this game, wait until 2017 or 2018 to buy it, because IOI is probably disbanded by then, and Squeenix would be willing to sell the game for cheap, because the way they run business with this game isn't looking very promising at the moment ( first location is good, second is awesome, however third one is a huge drop, along with screwing customers along the way )."

Been playing Hitman since ""Codename 47"" and really loved Blood Money and Contracts, besides the classic first one of course. I hope the developers use the episodic release model to fine-tune the game too...add more (basic) features, like human shields, maybe the notority system and so on. The Elusive Targets are a good (new) addition to the game...let's see how long they support them after the actual full release though. The DRM sends its regards too!

Gonna update this review from time to time; the game's currently on Episode 3, right after the ""Summer Bonus Episode"" was released.

And this is where it gets the thumb down...for now. I decided to buy the episodes one by one, so I'm actually paying more in the end.
But, thanks to Io-Interactive's genius episodic business model I can't enjoy the mentioned Bonus Episode, because they reserve this for people who actually bought the game at full price right away or the ""Upgrade Pack"". If I would get a FAIR discount for already invested money to upgrade it fairly, I could think about getting the ""rest of the game"", wich is ironically not released yet.

Pros: 
-a good stealth game/ even the slightest errors will fuck you up 
-graphics are nice even though it isnt optimized properly 
-cinematics are good  
Cons: 
-no way to fight head on like in absolution (not a totally bad thing, but for me i kinda like to be brash and reckless) 
-THEFUCKINGONLINEEVERYFUCKINGSECOND jesus this just make this game utter trash 
-some bugs and errors 
-story isnt really great, its very short and doesnt really have anyone enticing, just kill this guy then kill this guy o conspiracy? ok kill him. done 
-it isnt linear like absolution its more open world...but it kinda loses its touch after playing the same map over and over again 
-not enough fucking maps, i swear some are just reskinned. 
-not optimized, fps drops , tears even with v sync on  
Conclusion: if you liked blood money and a die hard fan GO AHEAD BUY THIS GAME ITS WORTH IT 
if u like a little assassins creed/absolution/more brash actions this isnt really for you, took me awhile to get my head into a sneaky perfectionist. but once u hit that WOW does it feel amazing. 
but due to the always online,the bugs,the optimization. i would give this game...like... 7.8 / 10. 
nothing to do with water...

Bugs: Expect for your game to freeze atleast once during a mission. 

Audio: The audio is completely screwed up. Sometimes voices will just vanish. Most of the time when characters are talking, it sounds like they are speaking through a horrible microphone system. This should be an easy fix and I am sad to see the developers were fine with publishing the game like this. 

Settings: baseline settings system; similar to a game from the early 90s. Basically no customazation options besides graphics. How about a setting for type of speaker system? (headphones, 2.1, 5.1, etc.)

The visuals are there, a joy at 4k, another success for the series.

The dialogue element of the audio is where the game takes a turn toward the inexplicably sub-par.  There is 47, there is Diana and then there is  NPR host does video game dialogue.  I could appreciate english being the spoken language at a multi-cultural fashion show in Paris .  I could even reason that Sapienza had a high population of American expats who had taken residence and were now working the shops during the peak of the anglo-tourist season and that many were chosing to speak in there best mock-Euro accent while visiting.  Now we have Marrakesh, apparently a new American stronghold in Morocco, populated by Paris and Sapienza expats and to top it off the Swedish Embassy got in on the action as well. The coincidence of running into the same voice actor doing a sub-par impressions across a multitude of roles makes it feel like I am still in the training missions.  What's more, when I feel the need to quit playing a game because the language borders on cultural mockery, it makes me start to look at the whole package in a different light and in the case of Marrakesh--the level design starts to break down.  As a USA locale remains on the list, I expect to hear these same grating voices at least one more time--but if they show up in Thailand or Japan, I may be playing in total silence and for a game that chooses to release serially as opposed to a complete package--with a month or more between these levels, err...episodes--I consider such poor dialogue execution a genuine faux pas.

Additionally, the online vs. offline single-player argument is valid as well and smells of a yet unreleased micro-transaction market (elusives anyone?) that is as behind schedule as the Companion App.

There is fun to be had here but I'd wait until the full package is actually complete and discounted if I had it to do over again or choose the episodic thing and skip Marrakesh altogether--at least until they make a few things right.

I've played the game for a whopping one hour and already I've been unable to connect to the server twice and for some reason the server insists that I've unlocked all of the achievements and progression while still keeping me at level 0 and thus giving me no rewards for completing things.

It's ridiculous how poorly it works, I'm getting a refund and I suggest that if you are reading this and unsure about buying, wait until it's been fixed or goes on sale.

Episodic release of content isn´t the best thing to have, especially if you get bored playing the same level over and over again with minor changes to what you actually do. For the most part it is just a stupid waypoint hunt. 
Storywise I have no idea what the story is actually about, blame that on the episodic content release and ingame clues. Some of which you won´t understand or connect to other hints until you´ve heard it all
On the technical side it´s utter BS, settings don´t get saved, serverside savefiles prevent you from playing if the server is down. If it is not you might get totally spoiled by getting instant challenge unlocks on levels you haven´t even played.
Way to go SE...way to go...

I wouldn´t buy it again for that price.

The best part about all of the hitman games is having lots of missions and completing them however you like. In this release, because of the lack of content, your forced to replay the same mission over and over and kill targets in certain ways so you can get achievements and unlock more things to help kill the same target in more ways. It effectively takes away your choice of killing targets how you want to.

When you think of games that release episodically you think of telltale games, the amount of content and enjoyment you get out of each episode leaves you wanting more but satisfied with the amount you've been given and progressed in the story, no matter how hard you tried you still had to take atleast a day to get through the story and all the gameplay. With this game however, I completed the first episode entirely within 20 minutes, and then was given a small piece of story, a pat on the back and basically told to get more out of it I had to just replay the same level again and again.

-Unoptimized, 40 fps in sections with lots of AI on the screen
-AI is very unpredictable in the bad way as they can be way TOO on edge

Although Hitman's release schedule makes no sense the $15 dollar price point isn't a bad way to get started. With it you can decide if you want to spend the extra money on missions, or just pass.

When you first start playing the game

You Feel

Its everything we wanted in a Hitman Game

Total Freedom

I really enjoyed the game when I started playing it

But then

After a few hours and three levels (including prologue)

You realize

What corporate greed is hidden beneath this beautiful game of Hitman

You soon realize quite a few features from previous games are removed (the good ones), as follows,

1. Ability to perform stealth action of dragging an npc in a dumpster while hiding in the dumpster
2. Weapons (they are blatantly locked and you need to complete challenges to unlock them)
3. Every level requires you to search for a screwdriver, wrench and crowbar (why can't I just carry it at start of level when I am clearly carrying a revolver)

Following are the features reflecting the corporate greed I talked about,

1. Offline and Online saves are separate, I was ok with it as I thought I'll play the levels twice, more playability, but once I played a level offline first and then online, it struck me, everything you do in offline does not matter, nothing is tracked, you don't gain experience and you dont unlock any weapons or entry points or hidden packages, nothing, nada, offline mode is just there as a showpiece, you dont even get to perform the opputunities if you want to at times

2. Given how they have neatly locked everything an assassin needs behind XP points, I am pretty sure they will introduce micro-transactions, pay $$$ and get this pack, pay $$$ and get X amount of XP, pay $$$ and ......

3. Online Contracts made by other players are not worth your time, Elusive Targets are a joke

4. Weapons and Shooting are hollow, you never feel confident enough to take down a wave of npc even when you have a machine gun, it just feels spongy and kinda hit and miss

5. There is no freedom, they have designated 4 to 5 ways in which you can perform the assasination and you have to stick to it specifically, if you choose to take the violent route then the game penalizes you and you get a 0 score even though you completed the objectives, really feels sick to get a 0 score after spending an hour playing the level when you get penalized for completing one of the said challenges required to gain XP because that challenge ended up killing non target npc as well, really, really, stupid

6. The music is average, you'll miss the orchestra by jesper kyd

7. Level of immersion is average, the game looks pretty in screenshots but actual gameplay graphics are not better than Hitman Contracts, even blood money and absolution looked better

8. Leaderboards are a joke, literally all the players in the top 50 are pretty close to each other

9. If you want to have fun, forget Leaderboard ranking, unlike previous Hitman games where you are ranked differently for the different type of approach you prefer (aggressive or stealth), this one just gives importance to Stealth


Time for some Good points :

1. You can finally climb buildings a little bit

2. Targets have backstory that can be exploited but then again you are restricted to the opputunities

3. NPC's have a side story ongoing which results in oppurtunities, gives you the feeling of exploiting an ongoing situation 
to achieve your target

4. Levels are bigger than earlier hitman games

5. Levels are Crowded with NPCs but since your arsenal is limited and needs to be unlocked, you cant have much fun, again, since the gunplay is shallow, you cant expect to survive in a shootout if you decide to be adventurous, you are more likely to die a sudden death (no armour and no option to put on armour as well)

6. Episodic, it leaves you hanging on the story but atleast you have something to look forward to every month

7. More ways to assasinate a target

8. Cutscenes between levels are well made

9. A few performance issues (specially in the new Marrakesh level)

10. You get to play Agent 47 again and going on a killing spree is pretty enjoyable with different animations for different weapons, you just have to be careful to avoid a firefight

11. Some really funny situations can be reached given the different varied gameplay choices you make

Conclusion :

I would love to recommend this game to support the developers but the shrewd corporate decisions made for the game change my enjoyment to disappointment, way sooner than I expected, really hope they get rid of the Online only component, atleast provide complete gameplay while offline and record statistics as well as unlock components, are they going to give a million dollar price to anyone who leads the leaderboards with integrity ? I dont think so"

1812,2,0.2915,"online, server, always, save, connection, offline, mode, lose, connect, need","From the get go I was against the very idea of this game. Hitman is one of my favorite franchises and having it be episodic sounded downright horrendous. Yet I heard from multiple places that the episodic structure worked well, the game was good and everything was fine. I decided to give Sqeenix yet another chance and buy the full game.

Despite terrible performance I had a good time with this game after knocking it down to medium/high (on my 100% WC, 980SLI, DDR4, SSD, Intel x99 build). They have nailed the basic Hitman part of this game. The combat is fun and challenging, there are plenty of weird stuff to do, everything is very well made. There are some unfortunate things missing from the good old Blood Money days, like customizable weapons and loadouts (other than picking few basic items), the newspaper report after each mission and the game can get pretty grindy if you want to unlock all the different weapons. But dammit if this isn't just a whole lot of fun.

Then the shoe drops. The performance seemed to get worse for me after an update, even with others reporting improvements. Servers go down making it apparant how incompetent the developer and publisher is at managing a server infrastructure and WAY more importantly how they handle what to do once that infrastructure fails to work.

Hitman is a singleplayer game with essentially zero multiplayer aspects to it apart from some custom mission sharing, yet without the online server you can't progress, use your unlocked items, unlock new items or even access most of the things you have, even when you have your save locally on your own computer.

But wait, thats not all! They even manage to mess things up more than that. Sometimes when the servers go down you can't even enter or quit the game, it just loads and loads forever telling you it finds the online server, but then can't get your information or something.

On top of all of this the recent release of Episode 3 tells people who pre-ordrered all the episodes that they have to buy the next mission in order to play it and redirects you to the Steam store, where it will actually let you buy it. I was wondering if I hadn't actually bought the full game and had to check my purchase history. This is simply inexcusable, you just cannot do something like this. The game not working properly is one thing, but potentially tricking people into buying the game a second time is just above and beyond, even from Square Enix.

My guess is that they fail to check for the full version and that the people who werent stupid enoughs to pre-order the episodes like I was are happily playing the game right now.

This game is such a ****ing mess, which is really sad given how great it is when it actually works."

(Example 1 & 2 = very little spoiler, rest should be fine)

Pros:

- Graphic & cutscenes are nice (but it is not everything)
- Story is alright (even thou i didnt finish the game)
- some statistics and game tweaks you can do
- one can create  missions and release them on the com. market

Cons:

- The lack of AI just gets me crazy. 

Example Mission 2: You have to kill a couple and destroy a virus (crazy story back in 1997). I killed the wife with a sniper rifle. The guards noticed it and alarm went on. Do you think the husband tries to escape? Or maybe triple the guards around the building? No! No more guards and he didnt ran anywhere. I was able to cook spagetti for him, get him to dinner and then kill him. In what virtual world are we living where your wife gets shot and you are like ""better get me some spagetti""!? 
This would have been a though job if one of them tries to run away as soon as the other one got shot (and maybe they try to get the virus to a save spot aswell?). 

Example 2: Reaction time of the guards: I can kill 3-4 guards in a row before one of them even fires at me. They are so slow that i sometimes feel like i am playing max payne and bullet time is activated (maybe in next hitman?). I know its all about being silent but still if you get caught you should get killed (instant)! I butcherd the whole lab and i went upstairs to make some dinner...

- The ""ranking"" system. You unlock new weapons (e.g. the sniper rifle) by getting XP which will get you to a higher rank. The programmers must have played cod mw2 and then decided it might have been a good idea - it's not! Hide this weapons on a map, create a money system and a gun market but dont introduce a ranking system. It is the number 1 killer in the world and he has to unlock a sniper rifle? Stop right there! 

- DLC packages. The marketing team should have known that a lot of hitman fans will play this game. Most of them are prob. 20+ or 25+. You treat us like kids and make us buy dlc's? Maybe next hitman will be 4 free and you actually have to buy the sniper rifle with real money (or maybe hitman dollar)? 

- online and offline save games do not work. Why would you do that? Only because you fear that people might crack your game? Nonsense!

- still no multiplayer/co op? How cool would it have been that one is the killer and one is the target (same maps as single player). Come on dont just do the same stuff with different graphics. Change the game! I am missing ""real"" game changers!

- Square enix membership? Even tho it is not mandatory i still dont understand - why would i want that? and who does that (pls show yourself in the comments). Maybe get a gamespy client back with the next hitman to get more spam?


still at the end of the day I wasnt very happy about it!"

if you do buy the game you should pick it up at a lower cost when the price drops or buy it at a used games store or website.

updating if people havent played it before. good part is that most of the awful hitman absolution mechanics are gone. now only a few people and the target knows who you are depending on your disguise and not everyone wearing the same outfit and the blending in with instinct is gone and also gone are the corridor levels where you are forced to only walk one way forward. one last bad thing is that its almost impossible to get silent assassin as no matter how hard you press X on xbox 360 controller you snap the neck of a npc that is not the target and not just choke him out.

pros

-return to the old ways of blood money when not everyone who wore same outfit as you knew exactly who you were.
-so far its only open ended maps and there are more ways to kill your target.

cons

-very buggy game that crashes 5-6 times more depending on which other game i played.
-using a xbox 360 controller makes getting silent assassin nearly impossible.

final verdict right now is a 2/10 considering how abysmal the game is in its current form. would most likely get 8 or 9/10 if the bugs are gone.

Not to mention the ""Elusive Targets"", which in itself is a good idea but what if you are on holiday during that time and cannot play? Well, your loss... Great, cool content!

Blood Money is still for me the Hitman reference, and even though the level design and freedom is pretty good in this Hitman game, there is just no innovative stuff to keep me entertained. I have been playing Hitman since the very first game, and this last iteration is a big disappointment for me, I had high hopes but it would seem like they were not able to deliver... I just feel like I am playing a Hitman Absolution DLC with nicer graphics really.

It really is a shame, because the graphics engine is decent and runs pretty smooth, which is also the case for the gameplay. So yes, if this is your FIRST TIME playing Hitman, then you will enjoy it. But if you are a series veteran, you will just be left with a ""are you kidding me?"" feeling. There are so many missing features from previous games, and I wish they made one of their ""Episodes"" all about assassinating the idiot who thought an episodic release of the game was a good idea.

Summary: It is the first time I feel pushed to write a negative review for Hitman. I feel cheated out of my money for a game that promised so much and delivered so little. Do not buy unless it is your first Hitman game - and even then, just get Blood Money or Absolution instead. At least until all episodes are out."

- The game is always online. This is mostly a mild annoyance and at least you can reconnect since a patch.
- Several annoying bugs. Guards have a tendency to die when you knock them out in a corridor. Guards often spot you when they're not even on the same floor. A guard even died during a cutscene, ruining my perfect score.
- ELUSIVE TARGETS. What the heck is this? Seems like a good idea at first, but for some reason there is a CERTAIN DATE to actually do the mission. I'd be fine if you only had one shot, thats ok, but a time limit where you have to do the mission? I missed the last elusive target because I had to work for the weekend in a place with no access to the game, so I had no way to do the mission during that time. This meant that I missed the elusive target. Now I see the next elusive target will reappear exactly the next weekend when I am again working. Meaning I will once again miss the target for no fault of my own. This feature alone makes it so I can never, ever recommend this game for anyone unless they somehow reveal that elusive targets will reappear at some point.

Pros: 

- The levels are huge with quite a bit of replayability
- The cut scenes are nicely rendered and the voice acting is excellent

Cons:

- Bugs! (So many bugs) 
From a technical standpoint I would have thought that most of the major bugs would be sorted out by now (several months after it's release). NOPE! Numerous, numerous, clipping errors, logic errors, control issues and the lighting (at least on my rig) is completely BROKEN. What makes it even more baffling is that (to my eye at least) Hitman isn't that much better looking than Absolution, nor are the physics noticibly better. So where are all these errors coming from, why haven't these issues been sorted out in the previous games?

Conclusion:

It's a real shame as I have been a long time fan of the hitman series but this just feels like a lazy effort. There are some serious improvements: Larger maps, compelling storyline (thus far), but as others have pointed out it still falls short of previous Hitman games in terms of what it offers. Additionally, it added a lot of things no one asked for like weird bugs and random game crashes. My opinion is to hold off at this time. Wait make the game devs fix this buggy mess and maybe it'll be worth the money it demands."

-I do not like weapon system and gear system. Please, having coin in your pocket never made anyone imposibble to have also some other things in pockets. like some small poison thing. 
-Do not like heavy weapon system thing. Please, if agency manage to plant some AK into your havey security building, they do not need you, they could easly plant some bomb, iside hisr closet.

-Do not like, console low IQ logic, with those mission triggers. Like u need to step on some thing that some M****F***er go on toilet or started to do something.. Me?!? I go when i need to go.  
-I do not like logic of those "" producers"". 90% of missions )contracts, escalations, feats, ...) are made for ome genocidial psyho maniacs, who just love to blow everthing up, who dont care for colleteral damage, or for some vampire fiction dudes. I suspetct that next mission will have something to do with star wars suit and light sabres. 
-And from all this fiction things, i figured out, that time is most important, it better to kill everything withinin 3 minutes, than to kill only target which take u hour or more. 

And story, hm. Maybe i missed something or some small notes on the bottom, but, hell i do not know what is story about,. And thats not all, even you knew, you wold forget what is all about till next misison update.

New Marrakesh map is really subpar, Makes Paris, and Italy look good by comparison. 

Lots of crashing issues for a lot of people, (Not just me) IO Interactive should be embarrassed all the way to the bank. (Haven't crashed on new map lately, who knows why.)

Comically bad voice actors. All sound American in every map (despite being in different countries). Zero effort was put into this. I could round up people on the street and make a more convencing, and acceptable NPC chatter/vocals.

The firearms are extremely lackluster. Nothing compared to blood money. The shooting feels really bad with every gun but shotgun. Shotty pulls through somehow. 

Hate using any gun honestly, because of the poor sound effects when you shoot them, and how weak the impact feels. Pistols are more effective than machine guns in this game. This game is all about knives, and close quarter weapons. 

Uninstalled. Would not recommend unless there's major stability improvements. (Reinstalled) Game is still boring, Still regret my purchase. This game could have been great. Good job.

Usually ""literally unplayable"" is a joke aimed at a small grammar error or something equally trivial. In this case it means the game is literally unplayable. It WILL crash to desktop every 2-5 minutes regardless of what 'tricks' you use to try and fix it.

I know this is not an issue with just my computer, as I've seen many, many threads discussing this problem. Some people seem to be able to get it to work, but a large amount of people are unable.

Running in windowed mode doesn't help, it crashes in both DX11 AND DX12. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it as well. There has been no update to fix this and it doesn't seem like there will be based on the fact that they have released the second episode without fixing the first.

Even the benchmark crashes.

The only consolation for me is that I recieved this game for free when I bought my Sapphire 390x. I might as well have gotten nothing though as this game does not work. Now I know never to pay for something from SquareEnix or Io.

My specs are: i5-6600, Sapphire Radeon 390x, 16GB RAM. This is well above the minimum AND recommended specs. To it's credit, the game looks amazing and runs above 50FPS at ultra setting for the 2 minutes that it runs.

Old Review: I was sceptical of this episodic bullshit but yesterday I decided to get it. All in all a classic hitman experience. Even the Paris mission is very good. I turned off all the markers and side objectives and whatnot and it was amazing. So good that I haven't even started the mission in Italy after like 7-8 hours of play and there are so many things I want to try. And I hear that one is ways better.

The gameplay is great, classic hitman. Most of the stuff makes sense and even the opportunities (which I haven't done a lot of since no UI helpers.) I mean altough they are scripted and kind a wait for you to stumble on them you still have to do them and some are rather hard to pull of. Only quip would be the lack of newspaper in the end (again!!!)

Graphics are ok. Some of the textures are very bland, and some of the animations are awkward but generally good. The game ran like shit in the begining and I have the fastest gaming rig you can build. We are talking 6th gen i7 with SLI gtx 980ti... and still ran bad. But forcing Highest refresh rate from nvidia control panel fixed all of that and now the game runs with 100+ fps with everything on max.

Basically I would say get this and get it now. There is a lot of game for 25$ (i decided to just buy the episodes as they are released rather than the full thing.) And I've been only playing the 15$ portion and already have 7-8 hours which is already a good deal. Besides there is a lot I want/haven't done yet in this mission alone. And as I've read the next one is really on the next level (haha.)

Why they chose to release the game in episodes is the main problem.  Calling it an early beta would have been more forgiving.  

I loved playing all of the Hitman games.  Playstyles from person to person differ, some may choose to kill each and every persone they come across, some may choose to role play thouroughly and disguise themselves to get around different obstacles.  This still holds true to the game, but releasing the game with just one ""episode"" is just not enough.  The game was released early March, episode one.  Promised to release separate episodes in consecutive calendar months.  We did not receive the 2nd episode until almost May, which still holds the company true to it's word.  But one can only play a single episode so many times before getting irritated at not being able to progress.  

The game as a whole (so far) is awesome.  However, I do not recommend purchasing this game until it is complete.  Yes, it states that the game is released in episodes, but it feels like it's in beta with all of the bugs.  As a matter of fact, an update was released late Apr, that completely broke DX12.  I am able to play in DX11, but why should I have to downgrade what my computer is built to run at on a new game?

If you are a fan of the HITMAN series this is going to be a tough installment to love.  The episodic nature hurts the overall game play.  Having said that let me explain.  As you are getting ready for an episode you start getting psyched up to go through and eliminate your target(s).  While you are in the episode things are great.  The gameplay is good and the environment is immersive.  Nearly all of the situations you find yourself in are believable and most of the time you can find a way to work with stealth, or not so subtly if you prefer.  Now the downside, after you finish the mission you're done.  Granted there are some extra challenges that help with replayability and help you improve your skills, but your immersion in the character and the world is broken at that point.  When the next episode gets released you get to ride the same rollercoaster.  I think this is going to be great when all of the episodes are out.  Then the backstory will make more sense and becoming 47 will feel more natural by having the ability to run through several missions at a time."

The Hitman series, a way for many of us to get our fill of strategically planned and surgically performed assassinations, or of cold blooded mass murder once we got tired of the same old routine...
These games might not have been everyone's cup of tea (there's a genre for everyone), but their quality was undeniable. I'll spare you the retrospective, because that would be a waste of time: They were awesome, for the most part... *cough* [i]Absolution[/i] *cough*

This Hitman(tm), or Hitman 2016 or... Dammit, Googling it is going to be so much fun!
Anyways, Hitman. A chance at a reboot, after the 180° turn of the [i]lovely[/i] Absolution (we all have our opinion here).

A chance to bring the series back to it's former glory, a reference, or THE reference of Stealth games, hell a genre of it's own!
Hit or miss? As much as I would like to give this one the benefit of the doubt (it is after all highly unfinished), I simply can't.
Fact of the matter is, this is sold not as an ""Early Access title"", but rather as an ""Episodic game"". Make no mistake, this nomenclature is nothing but a fancy new way of saying ""Early Access"", a pretext to advertize a game as ""complete, with a twist"".

Having to wait for each episode does not bother me, no. It is weird, but acceptable. No, what bothers me is how it is sold with no mention of it being unpolished and unfinished. It really feels like playing a Beta?!
Frequent disconnects (because yes, you have to log in...), mild bugs, not so good performance, a feeling of general lack of polish...


And this, is but the tip of the iceberg.

My main gripe: Where Blood Money allowed you to explore all possible outcomes, this one feels like nothing more but an on-demand murder gallery.
Press F1, out comes your menu. From here, you have access to anything and everything a map has to offer. Available assassinations, opportunities, discoveries, you name it...
After that, all you have to do is pick up item [b]Y[/b], or speak to NPC [b]Z[/b] to trigger event [b]X[/b], where [b]W[/b] inevitably happens. Super, scripted.
Obviously, it is the player's choice to disregard this entirely or go with it, but you'll have to admit it's hard to resist the urge. Locking that info up, encouraging you to unlock it would've probably been smarter.

Last but not least, a general lack of new features.
While the game is FAR better than the previous title, it fails to provide much appreciated innovations, things to spice up and improve the experience, and not make it just an ""HD Hitman"".
One example: Hidden and Dangerous 2. Now this game is some 13 years old, a real gem (you should definitely try it out if you get the chance). Such an old game had an ingenious feature, shoot an enemy, and their uniform is rendered unusable. No, if you wish to suit up, you have to somehow incapacitate the nazis...
This small, yet so great detail makes all the difference.

Yet Hitman clings to the past, hoping to extract more of that ol' nostalgia juice. Sure, we do crave for some nostalgia, but with a 2016 taste, if you please.

With the Game of the Year edition, I unfortunately have to change my recommendation to a no, at least for the time being. At this point, the Patient Zero campaign cannot be purchased alone, it's only available in a bundle that includes extra content either I either already have or do not want. Sure, Steam won't charge me for the episodes since I already own them, but I've got no interest in a costume pack that has three outfits and is half again the cost of the actual story I want to purchase. That's five dollars an outfit. It's ridiculous.

Original review:
Following the disappointing break in style that was Absolution--a great game, certainly, but not a Hitman game--I was worried by the seeming limitations of this. With Sapienza, my worries were removed. For the first time since Blood Money, I feel like it's fun to explore, and attempt strange, sometimes even ludicrous means of killing my victims.

I'll give a thumb down at this time.

[h1]Pro[/h1]
[olist]
[*]	A well-made game – it's a quite nice game. Hitman (2016) is my first experience of the Hitman series and I’m satisfied.
[*]	Diversity – There are many ways to kill target(s) and many routes to infiltrate and many disguises.
[*]	Throw something – You can throw a fire axe to someone’s head. This is my favorite.
[/olist]

[h1]Con[/h1]
[olist]
[*]	Ridiculous selling – They're selling an unfinished game and what I thought was they selling a paid demo game.
[*]	Always online – This game already uses “Denuvo” packer to prevent game from pirated and Denuvo is the most powerful anti-debugger solution and it is powerful as a “Dongle” protection system. Therefore; Do we seriously need always online for a singleplay game? At least my Internet has no problem but their server is the problem. While the server is out of service, you can’t use any unlocked special starting points, weapons etc. Always online is seriously stupid idea and this is the worst thing in this game.
[*]	Glitches – There are many glitches and bug. Sometime body stuck in a map and I can’t drag'em out and occasionally somehow they can see me through the wall. Also DirectX 12 mode it bit off. I’m not sure it is a NVIDIA’s fault or not but somewhat DX12 is bit broken.

This is how bad things are if you try to play OFFLINE IN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME

+HItman Has Subplay menus: Featured, Destination, Story, Contracts & Career
  All you have Access to is Story. You can play the story, where you go from point A to Point B.
  Each Destination/Story has 45,93 & 91 Seperate Challenges. 
  You DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ANY OF THOSE challenges UNLESS YOU ARE ONLINE. 
+If don't have access to CAREER & CHALLENGES you will not be able to progress in the game or unlock anything at all
   Basically you only get to play 15-20% of the game if you are Offline.
+ Exclusive FullScreen is also locked @ 30hz, I have no bloody clue whats that all about

Everyone is probably wondering, DUDE, just GO ONLINE. I beleive that is besides the point. The point is that none of this garbage makes any sense at all. There is absoluetely no reason for this to be happening. Because the game doesn't actually have LIVE UPDATES. You can tell everything is already created and are just on a timer. Seems as if IO Interactie created a masterpiece and then Square Enix Gutted that Masterpiece to death. I also never quit eunderstood the meaning behind heavy weapons in the game, because as soon as you fire a shot they  are all over you like white on rice. The game is designed for you to play it 1 way and only 1 way. I don't have an issue with that, I just hate the illusion of choice. 

Save your pennies and support publishers that supports their customers and not treat them like criminals. Always-Online is not the future of gaming. Single Player games have no reason to Always BE ONLINE.

Hi, my past self. The last two months have been fine although being fine has nothing to do with hitman. The game has been a dry desert for the past 1½ months.

And here's my july update. Can't recommend this to anyone, and i'm a sort of hardcore fan since the days of codename 47, that's right, c47, not blood money.

 Let's get real:

- monotonous voice acting
- runs horribly on any hardware beyond reasonable,  >60 fps
- lame content & unlockables (""I unlocked practically the same suit WITH gloves AND a striped tie! wow!"")
- lame release model
- menu music
- Diana's voice
- needs more safehouses
- needs a better contracts mode

+ rubber ducks
+ some unlockables
+ some lame content
+ at least we got a new hitman
+ better than payday 2

1912,0,0.5706,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","So I've been an avid player of the Hitman series, dating back to the first one. I've devoured each and every Hitman game since then, played each of them a multitude of times and returned frequently over the course of years if only to return to a few handpicked favourite levels of mine. Like the the Hotel in Contracts or the casino in Blood Money and while we're on the topic; Blood Money's by far my favourite game of the series.

The level design, non-linear approach and responsive, intricate mechanics, having a base of operations, the newspaper reports that served as summaries of your past work, all of that made Blood Money an excellent game. A couple of years later, blending out the forgetable Absolution, which had more likeliness to a weaker iteration of the Splinter Cell franchise, I thought we'd finally get a worthy sucessor to Blood Money.

Alas, I was in for a surprise. The new game's again subpar to older Hitman games, in almost every aspect. I mean, thankfully I can't pull a sniperrifle out of my pocket anymore (Absolution anyone?), but other than that we've basically went one step forth and two steps back.

Naturally the graphics are better, however the animations are not. Aiming down the sights of your gun looks weird and it's even worse once you crouch and the professional holds the pistol like a fucking scrub. It just looks completely unappealing and I simply cannot comprehend how they ended up with worse animations than in Hitman's predecessors. Instead of holding larger rifles in his off-hand, they're now awkwardly slung over 47's shoulder on an invisible string.

Gunplay feels unintuitive and unrewarding, granted Hitman never had the greatest, but I remember spending a fuckton of time just trying to get off the perfect series of shots when confronted with a target and its bodyguards and when in doubt, I finished one by one off after critically wounding them; another feature that's gone amiss. Also, remember how older games allowed you to shoot through doors? Yeah, that's gone too.

The new game's level design is pretty neat, to be fair, and paired with better core mechanics it'd most likely make for a great Hitman game. But not as it is, not when the game feels much weaker than its predecessors and more like a beta for a potentially promising Hitman game somewhere down the road.

To summarize;

+ level design is fantastic
+ graphics are much better
+ wide variety of options to complete mission objectives 
+ proper disguise feature reinstated (to a certain extent. hell, you could put on a disguise and practically sprint through to your target and shoot it - nobody would blink an eye at you.)

- core animations are partially worse than in its predecessors
- former, much liked core mechanics missing (being able to wound, store a weapon in a suitcase etc)
- gunplay is absolutely boring
- killing melee animations are stale, unrewarding and furthermore very repetitive
- AI is literally braindead (kill a main target, e.g. the boss of an organisation, everyone's back to business as usual within 5 minutes)
- additional, former core assassin weapon arsenal has to be earned through a redudant online xp rewarding based component

All in all I'm very disappointed with the new game and uncertain how IO went from building onto their franchise, to stripping so many things away over the course of the last couple of installments."

The optimization of the game is STILL terrible (April 2017 now) - doesn't seem like they will improve it anymore. I'm on a gtx 1080 and I get from rate drops to 40 fps, while 90+ in other places :/ - it's obviously an optimization issue and IO got their money and don't care anymore.  Do not support devs and publishers when they pull this BS.

And like everybody else mentioned, online drm = you can't play your single player game when they are doing ""server maintenance"".

Gameplay is alright, but definitely not worth full price, especially with these annoying issues and the fact that you are basically just gettting 6 or 7 levels of a hitman game - they try to make it artificially replayable - but it gets old fast - definitely do not buy it at full price!! Best to wait until the full experience is on sale. Even though it's a AAA game, it's not worth more than 20 bucks imo because the optimization alone is garbage and unacceptable.

Also something that really bugs me, the sound of the silenced pistols. They don't make that nice dew dew sound like in the other hitman games (yes i know silencers don't sound like that irl, but it's a video game and tbh they don't sound like the thud thud crap in this game either)

The game still contains many of the issues listed below, but with Professional mode it feels a LOT more traditional. Hopefully the next game remedies the rest.

Original review (2016):
My 47th review, how appropriate. 

I like this game, it's definitely a step up from Absolution, and I'd recommend it for the gameplay (but I'm not recommending it on Steam until all of the content is out and issues are fixed). But something other than the quirks of this game bothers me, and that's the amount of people making the comparison between this and Blood Money. eg: People calling it a ""true sequel"" to Blood Money. Or ""Blood Money 2.0"".

Blood Money 2.0? Yeah, no. How many features did we lose from Blood Money, and the series in general?
[list]
    [*]We can no longer look through keyholes
    [*]There's no first person view
[*] We can no longer upgrade weapons
[*]We can no longer collect weapons from each level
	[*]Everyone seems to speak in a US/UK accent, no matter where you go in the world, including the newly released Sapienza and Marrakesh. Even Hitman 1 and 2 had this sorted.
    [*]We can no longer use NPCs as shields and shoot at the same time
[*]Civilians no longer pick up weapons to try and fight you if you decide to go postal
[*]No difficulty levels, which in turn means no degrees of AI, notoriety or save game limitations
[*]The save system itself. The game is now an utter joke when it comes to having a high level of tension. Why worry about an action or what path to choose if you can just reload a save as many times as you like? I also like how 'challenges' can be completed even if you constantly reload.
[*]Dual wielding from the first + third game are still absent
[*]There's no sniper rifle case, the rifle simply floats on your back. Wasn't it promised that this would make a return? This is an issue because you always need a disguise to carry it, unlike before when the rifle was concealed in a case.
[*]Weapons in each level are the same as other levels
[*]We can now choke out anyone we like, or donk them on the head with a hammer, or *insert 100 other ways to knock them out* - whereas before you had a set amount of sedatives to take people out of the equation without killing (or you had to be clever about it)
[*]The AI never shut up with their commentary. Go play Blood Money and see how much they talk. This is one of the worst additions to Hitman, and really, it's just a gimmick all nextgen™ games use, it doesn't fit in with this series.
[*]Pistols feel like machine guns without delays between shots, and shooting feels shit in general. Load up Blood Money and use a snubbed nosed pistol or an upgraded MP5. *That* feels like shooting. *That* feels like the weapon has some sort of impact.
[*]The scripted sequences you can trigger. Oh god. I read from multiple sources that the Paris level didn't have any. After testing the level using various methods for ~7hrs, that's a load of crap. Both primary targets (and other important NPCs) are littered with them and can be triggered various ways, depending on how you approach them. The world doesn't feel organic when it's utterly tied to your presence. Here's an example of a test I ran: I killed 205 people in Paris yet neither of the main targets had tried to escape. Why? Because I hadn't triggered their appearance yet.

[/list]

The game design in general is fairly lazy. The game is quite good looking with lots to do, but when you look at how each level works in detail then you'll realise how many similarities there are. eg: If there's a glass you can poison, then you can assume there's a toilet nearby, plus 1 or 2 ways to dispose of a body. Decent guard patrols are near non existent, this is why it's so easy to complete every level with the suit only. I'd actually say this is one of the biggest problems. Look at the main routes of any level, then look how devoid they are of any AI patrolling them. We've also gone from having disguises in Absolution that were next to useless, to disguises that are too effective, especially with the poor AI patrol routes.

Saving, as mentioned in comparison to older Hitman games, is pathetic. There needs to be serious negative effects tied to saving to act as a deterrent to save-scumming, in this game more than any other game.

The good thing about previous Hitman games was that if you decided to do a level without stealth, the shooting mechanics were satisfying enough to enjoy that style of play. Not here though. Shooting feels incredibly claustrophobic. What's with having to zoom in so far when aiming? Why do we need hitmarkers to show we've killed somebody, a pool of blood and a lifeless body isn't enough? Good on them for removing the slow-mo effect when you headshot someone - but what's with the sound effect that plays every time you do shoot someone? And the giant crosshairs, especially for the shotgun? Console ten-foot UI garbage that doesn't belong on PC. The shotguns in previous games (especially Hitman 1 and Blood Money) were great and didn't need giant crosshairs that occupy up 30% of the damn screen.

None of this is even to mention what a joke the online system is, how elusive targets took over 2 months to be implemented once the game had released, the technical issues that still plague stability, or how the game has been cut up into pieces. I'm willing to bet that the only reason the game constantly auto saves is because of how it's tied to online dropping in and out. If they kept it like the old games where you couldn't save on the hardest difficulty level, you could potentially lose ~40 minutes of gameplay at any time.

Elusive targets were a major selling point for me (and others, I'm sure), but they don't really bring anything new to the game. Missions already consist of eliminating targets, eliminating them different ways, completing many challenges on offer, escalations, user created contracts and so on. By the time you've completed a decent amount of these activities, you've likely run through the level well over a dozen times. Then an elusive target comes along... and nothing's different. You simply have 48 hours in real time to kill them. You can restart as many times as you like so long as you haven't killed them, which again removes any tension the series was always known for. No new mechanics are added, nothing particularly interesting happens, it takes around 10-15 minutes to complete (assuming you know your way around the level), and then you wait a week or two for the next one. Pretty disappointing considering the hype.

It does have some decent additions - the graphics for one. The map is pretty detailed too, but more often than not, underutilised. The AI is (at times) a lot better with how they react to certain situations. But again, it's hampered by things like weapons falling through floors (constantly), guards dragging invisible bodies, guard AI running right past me while I'm actively shooting into a crowd, and crashing as soon as it all becomes too much for the engine to handle.

It has been over 3 months since it released and there's still no patch to address the DX12 crashing, random CTDs in general, or why I often slow to 20-30FPS on medium/high details with GTX980s in SLI and a 5930k. And worst of all; the amount of disconnects I've had to the servers while in-game.

It's hilarious how we're 10 years on from Blood Money, yet we've lost more features than we've gained. Blood Money 2.0, what a joke. You are beyond delusional if you still think that's a valid claim after having played the first two full missions for any length of time. The new additions are nothing with so many classic elements missing.

I also wonder where it'll be in another 10 years. I can still play Blood Money as it was always intended to be played from 2006, in 2016. Will this online-ridden game be the same in 2026?"

1931,0,0.4734,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","This, to date has been one of the worst Hitman games of all time due to a large number of reasons. 

First of all, let me get the good out of the way (what there is) and say that it can be challenging at times getting the perfect hit - playing the level again and again until you feel like a genuine assassin sneaking around and hiding in plain sight to take out your target. The AI is a little random and unpredictable, which makes trying to execute your perfect assassination which worked the last time, into a possible disaster. 

Now the bad. Graphics aren't great, and the animation (peope walking, picking up drinks and items) is a little spotty and still looks like their animation was from a game 10 years older. Escalation mode however is a poor attempt to try and get IOI to extend the replayability of their 6 maps (yes, only 6) by making you play the same maps and attempting to knock off random NPC's in the game. No the AI doesn't really change, and everyone else walks around in the same pattern as they would if you were taking out the target, so the banality of taking out some random person is pretty mind-numbing. 

The game is seriously unoptimised and still runs horribly on some of the best rigs out there. IOI had been promising DirectX 12 since the beginning of its release in March 2016, and only finally patched it in properly (apparently) just before November 2016. I have 32Gb RAM, an i7 Intel chip and 2x980 GTX Ti's in SLI, and the game gets a smoother and better frame rate when playing in Directx 11 over Directx 12, and the game runs better when I DISABLE SLI??? Seriously, when I DISABLE it, the game runs faster, and the forums have been full of people complaining about its performance. If you're expecting to play this in 4K near 60fps, you'll be sorely disappointed

I, myself contacted Square Enix in regards to its poor performance, giving them a detailed list of my computer specifications, and benchmarks on Hitman and after 3 weeks got the following response from them:

""We are sorry to hear that you are having issues with Hitman, we have forwarded the details that you provided for consideration by the developers.  Unfortunately we do not have any information on if or when it may be fixed so please check again in a future update to the game.""

Given the PLETHORA of performance and game issues that are still prevalent in the forums, it's quite clear that this game should not have ever been released, or at least taken more time to properly fix their game and considering their Physical version of the game is being released in less than a fortnights time, and if IOI haven't been able to fix the game in almost a year, I can only imagine that their release later in January will be nothing but disaster."

Simply put; this game is pure fucking trash. Honestly. Do NOT buy this game. Definitely not in it's current state and only after a lot of the following problems are fixed, which is gonna take a while. IF it's gonna be fixed.

- Runs very unstable and is nearly unplayable on older systems
- Mediocre graphics, nothing spectacular
- Mediocre animations
- Hitman: Blood Money-esque gameplay but very scripted events
- DRM-filled ridden piece of shit, requires constant internet connection in order to play
- Disconnects from server every once in a while which effectively removes you out of your game
- Very less worth for money, very few missions and content
- Episodic business model, releases one mission every month

Square Enix made a grave mistake by releasing this game. They had released it way too early and with too many faults and not only that, but the DRM detracts your gameplay a lot. The fact that they just throw you out of your own game because you lost connection is just ridiculous. Those issues are with many users and it's not due to their own internet connection, but is more due to the bad Hitman servers which presumably get overloaded with all those users signing in and out.

All in all, it's just sad to see another game franchise to be destroyed by aggressive DRM, wrong design choices and an over the top business model in order to get the most $$$$ with the least effort. I hope that they will change their decisions in the future and removes the ''Always-On DRM''.

I should have read the fine print when choosing to purchase the whole game while in it's unfinished (and in my opinion early access state). I feel they in hindsight that they could have everything a whole lot better if they released a demo for everybody to play and report back on (helping iron out bugs), instead of going down the episodic route. I've put 13.8 hours in to the first level and am now completely bored of it and don't think I could ever give it a single minute more, it's likely that every level will be this way until I have drained the game of any future enjoyment. Comparatively I think if they had chosen to release it all at once I would probably end up putting more time into it.

I wouldn't recommend buying this until all of the DLC is available as it's current form will probably disappoint you."

Episode 3 came out today. Except I can't download/play it because IO/SE messed up the release system, so the game (or Steam) doesn't believe I own the full version of the game and is asking me to shell out $10 for Ep3. Between this issue and how Episode 2 wasn't recgonized by the game until I deleted and re-downloaded the entire game, I've lost faith in not only this game, but IO/SE's ability to run this series. It's rather sad, Hitman was my favorite series from the first game all the way up to Blood Money (we don't talk about Contracts). But with such a botched release, being a fan of this series has turned from something fun to something tedius.

[Origional Review]
The Paris map is pretty. I'll give the game that. But after a month and a half of playing it over and over again? It's gotten old. A new map comes out tomorrow, but there's kind of a ""so what?"" feeling to it. Without even getting all of the challenges completed, I've somehow reached the top level of mastery in the Pairs map and unlocked everything that came with it, so there's no real reason to keep replaying the map.

Escalations are fun, but get pretty tedious fast. And this last update took all of the escalations I played and put them back into 5/5 status rather than ""completed"". So I have to replay them again to have them re-marked as completed.

This is Square Enix's second swing at a Hitman game, and while this is a massive improvement over the ""lead by the nose"" game Absolution, all the gimmicky stuff included kinda makes it a little painful to play."

Best Hitman game so far and I've played with all of them (finished most). Levels are masterfully designed and beatiful. They provide ample opportunites for replay and find new ways to kill your target(s).

But I still would not recommend the game for two reasons:
1. Online DRM: I play from China and I have a fast connection (China Telecom 200Mbps) and it drops me constantly making half of the game locked. Awesome. Hint to devs and their publisher: there are other countries besides yours you idiots and in many of them the internet is shit and it is not your customers' fault. This is how you make people pirate your games.

2. Episodic release: This is just plain stupid. This is one of those games where you improve your skills while playing, and if you don't play for a while you'll forget what you've learned. Plus I liked the game and wanted to play more."

Just graphic wise this game will turn off alot of people, they are not polished at all or even really in a early access state. (i've seen early access with less graphic glitches)

The gamplay is fun, and the graphic issues dont kill it completely.  I was suprised how fun it was despite these issues.

The major issue is this game is a ALL DLC game, you get one mission to start and have to wait a month or 2 between missions.  Might as well save your money and wait a year till they release all the missions and then buy them.  There is not enough content to keep 1 mission fun for more than a few days at a time.

1999,0,0.5264,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Okay, so i am making this as a NEGATIVE review, however let me say this is only for one big reason, wich is; CONTRACTS MODE, hear me out!

The main mission itself is really awesome and the map is huge! there is so many possibilities to take out your targets, i cannot wait for the next levels! i do agree this ""episodic take"" they are doin is a negative aswel for me, but i can look past it.

However a big part about these new Hitman games is CONTRACTS Mode, i loved it in Hitman: Absolution and I was glad to see it made its return here, having Contracts on these big maps would be amazing!

What i do not like about Contracts mode at this moment is the lack of features, for example i had spend hours making an awesome contract and could not wait to share it so my friends could try it out and see if they could complete it, this was a huge part of Hitman: Absolution and part of what made it so awesome for me, and i am sure many others to!

In Contracts mode in this game there is no way to share your contract with friends, or to even look for them via a simple search function, right now your contract just apears in the ""Latest contracts"" tab and after a while it is just gone as many new player made contracts apear, there is no way to find it back again so you might aswel have deleted it. (yes i know you can find in in the MY CONTRACTS tab, but that is only for me to see, why would i keep replaying my own contracts if there is nobody to compete with?)

Basicly what it comes down to is, Contracts mode in HITMAN 2016 is a MAJOR step back compared to Contracts mode in Hitman: Absolution.

Hitman: Absolution contracts mode had; Friends only filter contracts list & score boards, sharing contracts, easy way to look for new contracts, and an awesome rating system to see what other people think about your contract. HITMAN 2016 has none of these features sadly...

I hope Io-Interactive & Square Enix are aware of this and are working on improving the HITMAN 2016 contracts mode ASAP! but at this time i could not find any information on it that they are, all i can find is other people like me who are sad about these lacking features.

So here is my feedback for HITMAN 2016, its a real shame because the main mission is AWESOME, i cant wait for more and hopefully a much better Contracts mode! because that is what keeps me coming back to play, especialy now when you have to wait for more main missions aswel =(

Until then, my review will stay like this, but i hope i can update this soon and make it a positive!

This Game has a lot of potential but for some reason the Devs. decided to change a lot of elemnts in the Hitman series without atleast discussing with the community which caused the game to come out in the current state.

reasons to buy the game:
* The graphics quality and level designs are beautiful.
* combat technique and free roaming to decide how to get the job done is in your hand.
* Contract mode which adds creativity.

Reasons Not to buy the game:
 *Hars always ON DRM which disconnects you from your mission if the the server goes down or was unable to establish a connection.

* Very limited content at the moment preventing players from accessing all the missions atm.
*Unstable on some systems and servers are unreliable.
*Exclusive content being released to PS4 only which is not available on PC.

Would update this once all episodes are out.

The framerate, even when you have an AMAZING computer, will be 30 fps or lower, with ALOT of stuttering.

I feel like the whole game should be 15 dollars, instead of the intro pack, because if we do the math to match 60 Dollars, you only get the small amount of content you got in the intro pack, FOUR times... 

Yeah yeah yeah, the game ITSELF is really good, you can stalk randoms and wait for them to go into the bathroom, drown them in pee/poo and overflow the sink so it looks like an accident, so good on this game for having alot of creative ways to kill people..

Gameplay - 9/10, the killing creativity and gore is pretty great.

Performance - 2/10

I think my review will change somewhere down the road, but for now it’s been a more negative experience than positive. I find my number one gripe is the stupid connecting to server crap that only connects about 1 time out of 10. If you have to have it online connected don’t make your connection total garbage. Not only do I still have to manually tell it to connect, this happens at least 3 times before it does  and this happens EACH FREAKING TIME I GET IN THE MAIN MENU, it takes WAY to long for it to even connect or fail. I didn’t buy freaking bad connection simulator; I bought Hitman, or at least the beginning of it. This brings me to the other gripe I have. I knew that they were doing a mission a month or whatever and I was thinking that could be an interesting idea. I honestly didn’t realize I was getting one mission to begin with….. I mean I guess I could have read more but I figured if the thing was going to last me a month I would at least have 2 or three to start since they are really huge. One mission isn’t enough to make me feel like my money is well spent, at all. On the upside the mechanics of the game are very reminiscent of blood money; I love the weapon handling and the physics. I find the game runs really well at max setting for me on a high end system. All the flaws with the game are not in the engine or even in the game play. It’s all implementation and DRM choices. As I said I hope they actually care to fix it, but this game is mostly dead until there is some actual content to it anyway."

So, as many others have stated, this new ""releasing levels monthly"" plan is an absolutely terrible way to do this.  This straight up sucks.  The game is amazing, I thought I was paying $15 to get a few levels and access to contracts(which I don't bother playing contracts anyways).  Instead I got 3 ""training"" levels which sucked, I absolutely can't stand games that force you to do ""training"" missions even if its ""part of the story"" which is a cheap way to write the story(which by the way seems to contradict everything about the story in the previous games etc).

Hitman Blood Money was one of my favorite games of all time, played it from start to finish dozens of times over 5 years, then Absolution was a disaster, it ruined everything about the game that was fun(they totally changed it compared to what Bloody Money was).  Then they listen to their fans and release this new Hitman game which is exactly what everyone wanted, a new Hitman Game that was just like Blood Money in the way the gameplay was.  Awesome, right?  Nope.  We get to play one mission in Paris, which can be done way too many ways for me to bother trying them all.  It's a great mission, the game looks amazing, and I actually really enjoyed it.  Then I realized... that was it.  $15 for that one mission.  $50 more to get the remaining missions....  ok well I'll go for that...right?!  I mean it is a really fun game.... oh wait nope, if you pay for that you get nothing until they release the new missions, which is apparently the end of April...

WHAT HAPPENED TO MAKING A FULL RELEASE GOOD GAME????   These new business models for games is the most frustrating, game ruining, absolute piece of ^@#$%$# way to go.  Bloody money had a bunch of missions, it was a pretty simple game, looked good, gameplay was great, and now they have gone and charged $60 for what is essentially a single mission with future missions to be released monthly.  THIS SUCKS.  I want to be able to play the game from start to finish within a matter of a few weeks, so the story is fresh in my mind and I can really get engaged with the story.  This completely kills the story in every way.  It's fucked...  

How does this company get slammed by horrible reviews for their last game, then redeem themselves by undoing all the terrible changes they made to the gameplay, only to completely fuck themselves and their loyal customers by implementing the dumbest release model ever.  This is worse than season passes, which also suck.  They should have given us 12 unique maps/missions for $60 and then charged $10 for each monthly new mission as a season pass idea.  But nope.  You get one map(with a bunch of ways to complete it, but who fucking cares, it gets boring killing the two people over and over again on the same map without something different, I like to play Blood  Money from start to finish over and over again but not the same mission over and over again).

I can't walk atm because I'm waiting for surgeries on my feet and during this period I'm more relaxed on my rules of pre-orders etc since doing any crap that takes my mind of being stuck at home (however stinking bad that crap is) is better than doing nothing.

*Episode 2 - State of the game: So yeah... I tried to play the Episode 2 after a couple of days (or weeks, can't remember) of the episode being out. What surprise am I greeted with? The servers doesn't work! Yay! So if I wanted to play that day I would have no ability to progress and unlock new stuff or use new stuff. 

*The performance (playing the DX11 version with GTX 970 and Skylake 6600 CPU) since Episode 1 is alot worse. Had to reduce my settings to half of what they were before. (High settings to either medium or low). 

*Great choice to have always online DRM on a singleplayer games guys! Oh well... a few days ago I logged in again and completed the level while exploring most of the stuff in it. Took me an hour maybe. Most definitely doesn't feel like 1/5 of a full game. Maybe 1/15. 1/10 if I'm really generous, Blood Money had 13 missions and it seems like this game will have 5-6 in the end. 

*If each episode came with 3 of these levels then I'd say it's worth the price. But atm, there is no way in hell that any person who can walk (I.E not me lol) should put their money elsewhere. I don't see how they can justify releasing only 1 level every few months while also having Always-Online DRM AND Denuvo DRM. Scum bags is all I have to say. (Probably Square Enix fault)

*Original review*
  
Don't make the mistake of supporting these shady people like I did by buying this game. What will you have to deal with if you buy it? Let's make a list! 

Always Online DRM - check. 

Denuvo DRM on top of the Always Online DRM - check.

2-3 months wait time between episodes instead of 1 month (which they promised) - check. 

Too little content per episode - check.

*Worse performance now than at the release - check.

When (if EVER) should you buy it? When the Always Online DRM is removed and the whole game is completed and at sale. These guys are really shady and shady practices shouldn't be supported. They promised a new episode each month and that the episodes would be filled with content. Now they're going back on that promise when they've sold most of the games. Disgusting practice. They use Denuvo DRM which should mean that there is no need to have Always Online DRM, BUT THEY STILL USE IT! 

If you look at my hours played and think I got my money's worth, don't be fooled. I have played sooo many hours trying to make it worth it, but most of those hours (replays of the same levels) have had me so bored that I fell asleep in front of the computer... it's just my desprerate attempts to make it feel like this was worth it by pretending replaying a level 10 times is fun because it's big. Suprise! It's not! I actually would have rather had another game like Absolution than this crap. At least replaying them made you feel some success at perfectly figuring out the puzzle of that level. Replaying these levels are just too easy because the options are so many and so overpowered.

I'll never buy a Square Enix game again."

What's Good:

Our first map offering, Paris, is quite detailed and a large playground of murder. I have no issue with the new design being centered around repeating this large map with varying objectives. It's fun trying to complete escalations as the mission difficulty slowly increases. I used to play Blood Money in the same way, completing a mission and then trying a new angle. So it's cool that they've built this in with their unlock and challenge system.

Kills are satisfying in that there appear to be multiple options. There are some of the bigger more staged options and I would recommend turning off the Opportunities hints as they basically hold your hand. Beyond that though it's fun turning people chaotic so you can sneak up behind someone and stab them with a lethal injection. The core of the game (map design, ai, sound, visuals) is great.

What's not good:

I'm always amazed how developers can create something good and then shoot themselves in their own foot. I don't play Hitman for multiplayer. Leaderboards are why the game has always-on drm. And it's felt. On my final part of an escalation mission, I was disconnected randomly and bounced back to the main menu. This negated all the work I had just done. To have my play interrupted by a feature that I care nothing about in a game that isnt about other people is beyond infuriating. I appreaciate them trying to tap into community content with the contracts feature. But we don't need always on drm for that. 

Also the episodic release schedule is confusing for a hitman game. The story isn't compelling enough for me to WANT to see what happens next. Which has to be the case for Episodic release to work. Instead you walk away feeling like you have a very small repetitive game.

BOTTOMLINE: 
Core mechanics are great but the game is hampered by always on drm and episodic release schedule. Not enough content to keep you motivated to continue playing."
2067,0,0.6407,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target",What can I say? Meh. It's ok but I'm not excited to continue playing it mainly because of the lack of a storyline. It's a collection of set piece contracts all happening in the same place. Paris is just a series on unconnected contracts set in a palace during a fashion show. Memorize the layout of the palace and go through the motions soley for the purpose of collecting a number of achiievements.

2073,4,0.3194,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go","I am a big fan of hitman video game series and have always loved the game and appreciated any kind of changes introduced in the game. Even with Hitman Absolution, I was pretty happy with it. But this prequel to hitman video game series seriously disappoints me. Why? Well here's the list.
1. First of all, the thing that bothers me the most, ""you have to be online all the time to actually play the game"". Even slightest disconnection from your side or the server side (which happens more often than you think)would throw you back to the main screen. And boy, its so frustrating. To add to the problem, the servers are almost always offline.
2. You can't unlock any achievement when playing offline. 
3. The game's episodic release is a turnoff. It forces you to play the same map hundreds of time under different name. Call it contracts or escalations. I for one don't mind playing a map over and over but only the one that I like. Not every one of them. It takes away that freedom from you.
4. 6 Levels over 6 months is a long time.
5. Escalations are just like any other contract but with cameras and lasers, which is easy to destroy.
6. The game is buggy. NPC's see through walls. Didn't expect that from a game which is already on episodic release. It just points that the game is released prematurely.

note: the play time on my profile is actully the time I wasted trying to connect it to the server.

I would recommend to buy it only once all the episodes are out. The game might be less buggy by that time.

[Edit : Its been more than a week since the patch v1.03 was made available and since then, not even once was I able to connect online. The online mode sucks to such a bad degree, I can't help but give it a 0/10. Definitely not recommended at all. Waste of money.]"

2083,0,0.5905,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","It's a good game if you're looking for a hitman experience.  However, it's super short, I mean 2 hours and you pretty much used up your $15's worth.  

The AI - I wish there was a neutral rating because the AI is definitely buggy and a step back from the previous installments.  People who notice you will lock on to you no matter what (through walls and stuff) but the easiest way to avoid that is to just run which in previous games would have raised even more suspicion if you ran the moment they looked at you.  

Controls - it sucks so much for pc because it obviously was designed as a console first and pc second.  I quickly got used to them after a few changes but it just shows how much quality they sacrificed just to get us to shell out some money for an incomplete game.  

Missions - it's really just 1 mission for 15 bucks, the 2 tutorial missions isn't that fun since they're both super easy with disguises/methods literally just laid out for you.  The mission provided has a ton of people around, so it's fun for the silent killers with so many eyes and it's fun when you just want to go psycho.  

The good - there are a ton of new ways to kill someone and they definitely spent a lot of time to come up with all these various methods of kills.  They also removed all those scripted events from Absolution and it's more sandbox now.  I have no idea why game developers back then all thought we liked super linear games like Max Payne 3 (which kind of killed that franchise for me).  I'm glad they went back to the original sandbox gameplay, it was like when JC Penny decided to never have ""sales"" anymore and the company declared bankrupcy shortly afterwards since the CEO obviously didn't know crap about the business.  

Performance - really poorly optimized, I have SLI gtx 980's and it runs noticibly like crap with everything turned up.  I know that the game is designed for ATI graphic cards but 2 top of the line NVIDIA's should handle this game with everything on max.  I ran the game on a 4k monitor and had to use medium settings to play properly.  

Overall - this game is definitely rushed.  I wasn't so anxious for a hitman game that I couldn't wait for a full release vs. a 1 level beta.  Bad AI, people/things falling through floors, obviously the business execs were desperate for some cash and didn't care about quality of the game at all.  I mean, I probably would still buy the next episode since being a hitman is fun but it's getting real close for me to just give up on this franchise completely.  

TLDR - Unfortunately, great games like Dragon Age, Hitman, Mass Effect are all falling into the hands of executives looking to get rich quick and they don't care how badly they kill the Franchise.  At least they didn't just copy and paste levels like Dragon Age 2.  I hope that nobody is going to mess up Dishonored 2, hitman 6 is probably going to be fun next year when it's out of beta but I probably would have moved on by then.

I really like the first 3 levels. I really want to give it a thumbs up, but now it appears the ""monthly levels"" were just the first 3 months... which wasn't communicated until after the release. We now have to wait until fall for new levels. The summer releases are just modifications of current levels. Bash me all you want and look at my ""played time"" in games for some weird stalkerish reason. Count my first ""steam review"" as my first review (there are many other sites FYI because some commenters weren't smart enough to know that). Note that I BUY every game I play. I just don't always play the legit version due to DRM. Its why I have games with very little play time (again I shouldn't have to explain myself... an opinion is just that... if you don't like it, move on... i wrote it to help people who hadn't bought the game! not people that owned it themselves and felt the need to keep reading reviews)

Good game, just poor DRM and release schedule which is why I have left it a thumbs down. I have a 100/50mbit connection and every time I have been booted from a level, my stream (netflix or android TV) continues. So its either a server issue or a low timeout. I have only been booted about 10 times during play which is ok, but why put such an intrusive DRM in that punishes you for it going down. DRM doesn't stop piracy. Look at some of the classic over the top DRM's like Settlers 7. That was cracked on day 1 and was so unreliable for legitimate users an employee actually recommended the cracked EXE to fix the issue on a thread.

ITS NOT THE FULL DAMN GAME!!! it says full experiance but its not. youd think if you spend 60$ on a game that it would
be more than one freaking mission.

there a tutorial mission or 2 but only one main mission.....  60$ for one mission at release?

im not to upset really cuz i read the reviews and knew but i have to agree with everyone else its a little upsetting to pay 60 for literally 2 hours of gameplay.

Cons: not the full game ( i get it, it comes out in sections but still)
needs some optimization 
i noticed you cant swap sides with your weapon......  (like the division or just about any other good ""combat"" game)

pros: it is very pretty. (needs optimization though)
i held at a steady 60fps on MED-High settings with a GTX 980Ti

in a year when everything is released and patched itll be worth 60$

if you CANT wait like me get the 15$ intro. that price seems to be more fair.

Pros:

Nice refined graphics and huge crowds giving a sense of atmosphere.  

Pretty open world and lots ways to get to the target.

Cons:

Online DRM - You have to be online to play with all the features/ addional weapons etc.  

Even if you are online, you'll need a superfast connection.  In my case, if someone else uses the net in the house (netflicks etc) , Hitman detects the drop in speed and kicks me out of the game saying 'You have lost internet connection'. and back to the games start menu you go.  Nice one....

The devs obviously didn't get the message that we want lots of weapons to choose from.  You start with a pistol and the only way to get better guns, sniper rifle etc, is to play the same levels over and over in order to unlock 'points'.  Worst of all, you get no points for a Silent Assassin rating without being spotted etc.  Instead, you need to achieve 'comedy' objectives such as kill with a falling chandelieer whilst wearing the wizard costume.  Great....

In sum - Lots wrong with it and you have to wait a couple of months for each level as this release only has a training level and the 1st propper level (about an hours worth of gameplay).  My advice, wait untik the full campaign is release and it will probbbaly be discounted by then too."

This game was advertised as being complete and released on the 11th March.  It was advertised as an open world, the ""World of Assassination"" as it were.  Not so much.  I had Hitman:Sniper on my tablet, which was OK while I played, a bit repetitive and limited but hey whatever.  This feels pretty much that game in PC form, only much more expensive and less fun.

Why oh why do games developers do this?  Ruining a perfectly good franchise is not only ugly, it's downright evil and loyal fans and new potential fans get put off altogether.  I experienced this with Tomb Raider, as a seasoned Raider player; now as a first time Hitman player I'm disgusted with the entire franchise.

My son owns Blood Money, which I bought for him on my account, but never played myself.  I mentioned that I have the tablet Hitman:Sniper game, which was fun if not overly repetitive.  This is my first real Hitman game... I was looking forward to it based on what I'd seen.  Holy cow was I in for a disappointment.  Why?  The amount of content provided for the money is extremely poor.  I went off and paid for the game, thinking ""I'll enjoy it""... and then found out that ""ah, well, see, we didn't bother finishing the game; you'll have to wait 6 months or more to get the 'episodes'.""

Gameplay, for what actually works, is easily a 9/10

Especially at the premium of $60. You can get the game experience for just the $15 right now and at that its barely 2 hours of gameplay. The mechanics are good and the visuals are stunning and a great follow-up for a Hitman title, but its not really worth it for the content you get. Sure, you have the special contracts and different challenges, but really? what happened to when a Hitman came out you had a full on experience for hours on end doing various missions and then you have this...one mission with promises of more to come at a later date... i completed this one mission at less then 2 hours (only because i was running around like a retard picking up hammers,letter openers, and crowbars and stalking random people walking around).

That just simply causes a graphics driver crash after 10 seconds. DX11 - terrible performance. DX12 - Not much better and only manages to run for a matter of seconds before crashing.
   I did play the first mission a couple of times, and I gotta say, it does have the ""blood money"" vibe. It was fun, but I can imagine that playing 1 level repeatedly for a month is going to become boring, no matter how much re-playablility they claim. 
   The structure sucks, they should of just delayed. The Performance sucks even more. The idea is good, the mission, gameplay, everything in that regard is supurb, but when it runs as poorly as it does, I cannot justify giving it a good review. I've requested a refund, and maybe a couple of months down the line I'd consider getting it again, if they solve the issues and actually deliver the promised content.

My reccomendation? Leave it 6 months, wait for a sale/discount and then get it. Assuming they actually bother fixing the horrendous performance issues.

The game is a step back from everything Absolution built up. The graphics not even ""Next Gen"" worthy, more like ""Last Gen"". The animation look stiff, like from the early 2000s.

Second, the movement and keyboard settings are absolutly shit
Third, no real introduction, you have to find everything out by yourself
2nd introduction mission, i have no clou how to do it, there are no hints or any description how to solve the puzzle. Besides, am i in a puzzle game or in a hitman killer game?

you have not much freedom how to kill the person, in the first mission (you have to do this twice to progress) you have to get close and kill him. Poisining is abolsut a waste of time, he never eats or drinks or you have to wait forever. ( i do not want to sit around until something happends)

In my opinion, the last hitman was way better, forgett this new realeased hitman 1, even i remember to sniper guys from the house or get a bomb on the car to blow them up, it has not the style from the original.

So whats the problem?
The main issue I have is the publisher is not being honest about what this arrangement really is.   At the very least it's Early Access.  At worst, it is a creative way to rush an unfinished game out the door while mitigating a large portion of the backlash.

In short, the game is nowhere near finished.  We have a couple of maps to get a taste of the game and now we can wait or play the same map over and over..  but hey the season 2 trailer shows the real game we are waiting for.

What about the online features?
To me it's late content.  The timed offerings are there to get you buy the game.  Hopefully they add the limited content back in at a later stage and consider adding even more maps than planned.

-Poor optimization, getting avg 45 fps on high quality with a Gtx 980 TI

Overall:
The game is not bad, but the reason i'm saying no is that it's not currently worth the 60 USD. Basically people who payed for the 15 bucks has the same content than people who bought the 60 bucks game for now, untill we get a new mission.

The first training mission alone is a mess of bugs, glitches and idiocy.


When you get aboard the ""ship"" and you are prompted to smash the cooks face in with a hammer doing so will alert the ENTIRE SHIP to where you are, what you are wearing and what you have just done. All that with NO windows or open doors etc that anyone could see you do the deed thru. Yes, someone could have heard me throw a hammer in the cook's face but that doesn't explain how they instantly know where i am and how i am dressed ??!

Basically the entire crew and all passengers should be VAC-banned for wallhacking!


Next we have another great bug, if you do get caught smashing the cooks face in, quickly taking his clothes and hiding his body will make the guards follow you around screaming at you but they will never actually do anything. They basically just get stuck in an endless loop of following you around. And all the passengers freeze up in fear too...


The last thing i've found after just ~30 minutes of game time is that if you complete challenges, save the game after completing one or more challenges and then reload that very same save the challenges are reset. So you are basically fudged if you mess up and have to reload even once. You might as well do the entire mission over again because some challenges can only be done once...

An example: I strangled Ritter with the rope but got no challenge completion for it because i reloaded a save made after i had killed him. So Ritter was still dead but my challenge progression was reset. Good job IO, Square or whoever rushed this game out without testing it properly...


In it's current state i WOULD NOT recommend people buying this but instead waiting until the price drops and the game is actually playable without massive bugs and glitches."

Optimization is REALLY bad, I'm running at 1080p on an overclocked  i7 4770k backed by a single GTX 980 and 16GB of RAM and it dips below 30fps frequently. It's very possible that Square Enix knows this, and makes the game ""episodic"" to buy the devs more time to fix it...at least I hope they plan to fix it. How they messed up this badly I don't know - Absolution ran smoothly all the time on my old, slightly weaker machine.

Gameplay itself is actually very good. If you run around, you will find ""Challenges"" in which the game essentially holds your hand to fulfill an objective. Overall it's a much easier game to get into than any Hitman before it (remember the last mission of Silent Assassin when you fought alone against 30 guys with sniper rifles all camping in a church?). One drawback is that you die pretty easily (2-3 gunshots) so mass shooting your way through is probably not going to work most of the time unlike Absolution. 

Graphics look okay even on medium, but not spectacular on ultra either. For the hardware requirement I expected more. But this game honestly has never been about awesome graphics. It looks as good as or better than Absolution if memory serves me correctly, and I'm fine with it. At least 47's head actually looks round now instead of jagged thanks to the power of 1080p and AA/AF. 

I admit, I am a Hitman fanatic like most of you. If you are like me and have a decent PC, I think you will love the experience more than hate. If you're not, don't bother right now - at least wait until it is 3-4 episodes in and see if the situation gets better. I'm sure this review section will constantly get updated as episodes come out."

[*] the feeling of being a real hitman

[*] solid performance
[*] fun if you like the stealth genre or just the Hitman series

[*] im still not sure if i like having no health indicator at all
[*] the stupid Instinct system is still there, althou not as bad as in the previous installment
[*] why can i not melee with the left mouse button like before??
[*] have to drown the target? 
sure ok. but why do i have to poison them first so they go to the toilet to throw up and then...and only then...you may drown them. why can i not knock them out and...simply drown them by draging them there? drowning only works with poisoned people...noted.
[*] why....did you take Human Shield / Take Hostage away from the game...?
[*] waypoints for challenges? really?
[*] artificially stretched challenges. 
id rather have a good dozen difficult ones (that are fun..) per level rather than 76!  which simply means i have to restart the level over and over and over because they almost all interfere with each other.
i couldnt think of 'a' game where a level would be worth restarting that many times and im a gamer since 20 ish years.

[*] constant online-drm...in a single player game. dafuq?

and instead of something-something online, all you keep clinging onto is this lame Contracts Mode. it could have been so much more with some form of co-op or pvp.
hello..from 2016!!
[*] the most moronic AI i have seen in a very long time.
Hitman Absolution did it better.how did you downgrade this even?
a no-go in a SINGLE PLAYER game.
[*] and how, for everything thats holy, do you manage to downgrade animations? 
47 walks robotic like the terminator, civillians seemingly hover 1-2m over the floor when pushed/walked past. you draw your weapon in a snap-instant-movement. previous installments did it MUCH better. 
i mean i could understand doing something wrong and then doing it right but you did it the opposite way. 
how is that even possi..what ??
[*]no hitboxes ...or realistic behaviour to being hit.
you know, that kinda..is important in a game about...killing.
remember previous installements where hits by bullets where kinda realistic? i remember one where a civillian would even roll all over the floor,holding his knee because you shot his leg.or crawl to a weapon on the floor and trying desperately to use it against you. 
here? no, not here . here its like ""no hitboxes meets shi$$y AI"" . 
gets shot in the back,falls foward, gets back up,holds his head in a dramatic manner and yells  ""oh no, a gunman!"" while looking around..
i have seen people standing back up after a headshot from distance..or die by a bullet to the a$$.
[*]last but not least...
really?releasing one level with the option to still pay the game at full price? lets go to a car dealer,pay for an entire car and only take the doors home. rest still to come..and lets 'hope' its a nice car. 
whoever made this descision should get fired,no questions asked; and yes im serious.

Review(25.03.16): 

This game is good, has a strong concept and can be great with updates. However it saddens me to speak about not game play but always online DRM in this review because in its current state I can not recommend due to it. Even if they say it has offline play, it does not include major features that you PAYED for.

You can not earn challenges, you can not play escalations missions and other stuff while offline. What is worse not one of these features requires always online. Game could have easily download required mission data and let you play offline, then upload your score online. As of right now you can spend long time in an escalation mission, disconnected, and lose all of your progress and therefore your precious time. I also could not unlock various challenges in the main mission including Silent Assassin even if I got them several times. This is again (and I guess) due to synchronization failure between server and local data. In the end I got tired doing the same things over and over again.

I do not have any sympathy for a game that does not respect your time. We see other online games keep track saves, your progress for ages and for a pseudo-online game to not have these features or implement this online DRM in the first place is not acceptable. 

Developer Io-Interactive said that they want this game to be living experience. They said that they would improvise the game with constant feedback coming from players. I too think this kind of iteration and episodic format is really suitable for game like HITMAN that has a complex social simulation. If they are to keep their words this is where they start, with removing or compensating ALWAYS ONLINE DRM.

While I am writing this review, the average user score is at 53%. If they insist with their policies, I do not think people will buy further episodes. I also will be devastated to see such potential goes to waste in the hands of incapable developers and publishers.

I will change the review accordingly if these issues are resolved. Please DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR THE UPCOMING EPISODES before this nonsense ALWAYS ONLINE DRM issue is addressed."

I've been a fan of Hitman since the very first game and played (and purchased on different platforms) more hours of Blood Money than I could even guess. I was really hoping that this game would be a return to form for the franchise, and from some of the things I've seen and done in the game I honestly believe that it could have been.

I don't absolutely hate the episodic release, I wish it would have been a full form Hitman game but this gives me some incentive to really flesh out and explore each level. Honestly there seems to be a lot to do in the main Paris mission that we have available, and that really bodes well for each subsequent level we get next. 

Now on to why I wouldn't recommend this game in it's current form. I've got a pretty beefy PC rig that should be absolutely able to run this game at 60fps on at least high settings. The entire first ""tutorial"" mission was initially unplayable due to what seemed to be a problem with shadow mapping, causing the screen to be almost completely blacked out by blown out shadows. After resetting the game multiple times it finally randomly decided to start working. After getting through the tutorial stage I was able to get into the real meat of the game in the Paris level. This time a lighting issue (that I still haven't been able to fix, regardless of what settings are changed) made the game look like absolute garbage with flickering lights and overblown shadows. As long as I wasn't in an exterior environment it seemed to function fine. 

Finally to put a stellar cherry on top of this turd sunday I was just about to complete my first Silent Assassin run of the Paris mission when I get this text popup onscreen stating that I was disconnected from the server. In some bizarre choice of DRM the game needs to be online, I assume for the leaderboard to function correctly. One would think that the best option in that situation would be for your game to go into ""offline"" mode, nope it just kicks you back to the main menu. I will add that the game has an offline mode that I will now be utilizing.

There is great potential here, and honestly it seems like there's many things that IO Interactive could fix. I think this speaks to a larger issue with games in the last five to ten years, the mentality that ""hey we could just patch it"" if things aren't working. I understand the idea behind releasing patches for obscure bugs/glitches that weren't picked up during testing, but for the game to be nearly unplayable at times is (to me) unnacceptable. For many developers patching seems to have become a crutch. In short, I would wait until a few episodes have been released along with (hopefully) a few patches as well. If you're a fan of Hitman I know you'll recognize the potential this game has, but I still couldn't recommend it as it currently stands. I give it 3 crow suits out of 600 rubber duckies (review scores are pointless).

2177,0,0.4659,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I was quite disappointed with this game. I was expecting it to be more or less like Blood Money, but with the Absolution style game mechancis and graphics. However, in it's current state, there are a lot of problems and I wouldn't recommend buying it at all.

Cons(-): 
- Always Online
- If your machine was just good enough that you could run Absolution on Ultra high settings, you can run this with everything on minimum and it will still lag
- The ""Modular"" release format leaves this game with a serious lack of content at the time of release; this is pretty much the same thing that happened with 'Elite Dangerous' (i.e. it was released to meet a deadline, when it was obviously not developed enough to be ready for release)
- It feels like the game was based off of the blood money rather than absolution as it's backbone; clues to be found in some glitches from blood money like how sometimes dragging a body would not work
- Running the same mission over and over in different ways is very repetitive; at the moment, there is no variety in missions (there are literally just the tutorials, and one single map! Is this a joke?). Blood money had a lot more content than this. So did all the other hitman games. I would rather play the old ones than this. 

Pros(+):
- Honestly, I have no pros to post. As a huge fan of the hitman series up until this point, I am seriously disappointed.

Conclusion:
If you have a machine that can run this on max settings, and you want a good game at similar price point, get 'The Division' instead. Unless they release like 10 more levels in the upcoming patches, this is not worth it at all.

EDIT: Updating my review for the release of the Sapienza portion of the game. IMO if they genuinely only plan to release one more map after this, then that's an absolutely disgusting lack of content. Having been a fan of all previous hitman games, this one is just bad.

However performance-wise, the game performs better on this level than on Paris for some reason. Playable FPS is possible on semi-decent machines if you overclock the GPU (still, you shouldn't have to) but it's still doesn't have the look or feel of absolution. Yes, they spent lots of time making the maps big. But 3 maps does not a good game make and playing the same map over and over in 100 different fashions is just not good. Waiting for the 3rd release, but after the first elusive target and Sapienza, I would still DEFINITELY not recommend this game to anyone under any cirucumstance."

No upgradable weapons, no newspaper ranking system, or really ranking system at all, just a check list of things to do, which is fun and well done, but no real ranking, reporting on your playstyle, just unlockables and acheivement style gameplay. That part is done very well, and is fun, but people trying to say this is the next Blood Money, please STFU. The fact I found out... just the time it took me to write this plus five seconds, that I got hosed by buying the intro pack was even more of a slap in the face for this silly style of releasing a game. I thought we were going to get installments, not just a teaser reason to spend more on the same game that was going to be released in it's entirity very shortly after the first teaser. There's fun here, but they haven't figured it quite out yet what made Blood Money, Blood Money. Or even Silent Assasin, in some senses, as even that had a ranking system. When you offer the player different styles of ending the level, why not tell us about it, make the ending you chose actually matter other then just a new unlockable location or disguise, give us ranks and reporting on how you've done based on the play style you've chose. I'm sure other players have just tried to destory and break these open levels before and take every npc out to see if you get any crazy titles and ranks, or even unlocks, as this doesn't seem to recall that this game does present Yyyuge challanges, even more so this one, for those who want to try and tank their way through a level.

For now, I don't recommend you to spend the €60 on this game -> wait until they patch the game with performance improvements and/or a driver update is released (Nvidia). I'm running this on an i7 3820, 48GB DDR3 RAM and 2x MSI GTX780 Lightning (CPU&GPU's are watercooled). SLI isn't scaling and with MEDIUM settings/1080p (because of the V-sync issue in this game) I'm still experiencing massive fps drops. I know it is not the best system you can get these days but still pretty decent if you ask me, and should be more than enough to run at least smooth on High (not Ultra) settings. CPU and GPU's don't seem to be the bottleneck neither because non of these are really utilized in game (avg of 50% usage). VRAM isn't fully utilized neither (~2GB)."

+ Fun gameplay (physics, AI, variety of options)
+ Good graphics
+ The Paris map is huge (currently the only available full level)
+ It gives the feeling of Blood Money.

- Performance issues (low fps with decent GPU)
- Pay in advance and only play one level per month (Completely ruins the story)
- No option to buy and modify weapons (I'm not sure if this feature will come at all)

2197,0,0.6845,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","In a single word Hitman can be summed up as ""bland"".  Nearly ever aspect of the game is bland, boring, uninspired, and unimpressive despite how nice the trailers leading up to release were.  The game fails to deliver pretty much everywhere.

The gameplay just doesn't have ""it"".  That feeling past Hitman games have had, it lacks.  As a veteran who's played every single game since the original back on my old Windows Millenium PC I can't believe just how lackluster it feels to be a Hitman.

There are tons of reported DRM, ""Online Always"" and save game issues that have plagued the release, but to be honest none of that has affected me at all.  I've never had a game interupted, nor have I been disconnected.  So when you factor that into the equation this game should be relatively good as major publishers have stated right?  Wrong.

The game's gameplay itself is extremely basic.  While the previous Hitman installment lacked variety, and assassination targets largely because it's adopted a linear story mission based world, it nailed the gameplay mechanics perfectly.  In the previous hitman game the controls, and gameplay were rock solid.  Weapons felt great, player movement was spot on, and you generally felt like you were Agent 47.

In this new release I don't feel like 47.  In fact it feels more like a bad Hitman knock off.  The gameplay feels watered down.  Player movement and animations feel dated, and it's a big step backwards for the series.  The gunplay is abyssmal.  Never in the history of Hitman has shooting your signature pistol felt so underwhelming.   The typical methods of killing your targets are there, guns, poison, explosions, and a few unique ones.  But now that the missions are so large they are actually a drawback for the series. 

The Paris mission is quite large, and there are many of conversations to be heard which open new ways to kill your targets. But it takes time, a lot of time in fact.  You can spend hours on a single mission, but after the hit is done I never got that old satisfying feeling.  It's marred by technical issues, poor AI, watered down gameplay, and just doesn't feel good.

The soundtrack is fine, but for whatever reason the game starts if off way too loud.  I think that's to hide the fact that enemy AI doesn't pick up on sound cue's well, or at all.  The sound bars all end at 20, and I had to put the sound down to 4 before it was acceptable.  I want to hear footsteps, doors closing, and everything else that I would imagine an assassin would.  I can't see an assassin of 47's calibre walking around with earbuds on...

Graphics are good.  A downgrade from the previous Hitman, but still good enough maxed out to be pretty.  The game makes a poor choice of locking Textures on Low as if you're too stupid to tweak settings yourself.  You can do some in game, but I've seen others state that with less then 2gb of Vram on your GPU you cannot put textures on Medium or High which is silly.  The previous Hitman title didn't do this, so why now?

I found the tutorial to be pretty frustrating.  Big dump tips and tricks to help you succeed, and very poor controls from the get go.  Unfortunately the game locks the Key Binding outside of the ingame menu, so you have to quit in order to change the controls then go back and see what you like.  Overall the controls suck.

In the end you get a highly diluted Hitman game.  There are tons of challenges that aim to improve the replay value, but personally I would have wanted more missions from the start.  With completion of the Paris mission you're left with more or less nothing.  If the gameplay mechanics were spot on then maybe I could see the replay value, but when the gameplay isn't good you're not going to be coming back for much.

Episodic Hitman is bad on many levels, and here's why.  In previous Hitmans if you didn't like a level or had a hard time on it you could go in guns blazing, get the kill and continue on.  Here, you can't do that because there's nothing to continue on to.  Personally I found the Paris mission to be horrible.  Unappealing on the eyes, boring characters, and no reason to replay.  It's the type of mission I would complete and never replay.  As a first impression this game leaves a dirty taste in your mouth.

Another issue is the lack of 47's previous bullet proof self.  In past games he could absorb quite a bit of damage, so if you decided to guns blazing you could succeed.  Here that's no longer the case.  2-3 bullets and you are done.  The games blood is also a downgrade.  Kills used to be colorful, and there would be more blood.  Instead here it's limited as if it was made for a younger crowd.  This is not the Hitman game I want.

As a longtime Hitman player this is a series low.  The fact you have to wait weeks to get another taste on another level just boggles the mind.  If the initial impression was amazing we would put up with some crappy follow up levels, but the initial impression here is full of failure.  If this is the end of the Hitman series it's a damn shame, but at this point it's not hard to see someone else come along and do it much better.

Overall 4/10.  Back to the drawing board."

This is a good sequel to blood money, and they made many options available for the more creative assassins out there, unlike Absolution, which forced you through missions certain ways.

However, once you play the same mission over and over you start to see the cracks in the level layouts and AI, and you realize that you have less freedom than originally thought.

Eventual full release will probably be a 8.5/10 for me.

First of all, it still has some of the shitty mechanics from Absolution. Random people of certain groups (Police officers, mechanics, staff...etc) can see through your disguise. It's realistic, yes, but it's not as fun as it was in Blood Money where you could go anywhere unnoticed with a disguise.

Also, where is the blood? The older games had plenty of it and let you play exactly how you'd like. The new ones actively punishes you for killing whoever you want. You can see through walls and you're hand fed with extremely obvious hints which takes away the immersion of the series.

They have casualized the game and it goes against what the old Hitman games were about: Trial and error as well as individual exploration.  Also the new one has strict DRM and is episodic (another cancer the industry has put upon us)

The good thing about this one is that the levels are pretty huge and it's stunningly good looking (DirectX 11 looks exactly like DirectX 12, except 12 freezes the game after 10 minutes)

The intro pack should be free as a demo until they made all the levels for a finished game later on. I'm going to play this game for a little longer to see if it's better than the first impression. Until now, the game is pretty bad for being a Hitman game.

2214,0,0.447,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Here's the deal guys, this games critique is very valid. Does that make HITMAN a bad game? Well, it has all the hallmarks of a negligent studio for marketing, but the core still seems to be valid so I would say no.

This version brings back all the old glory we used to love in the hitman series. You decide how things are done and have free reign of the place. Overall the controls aren't that bad, and everything seems to feel pretty fluid. The level design is pretty legit, and just on a few play throughs, I've only less than a quarter of the level. Sound design is immersive, and doesn't pull you out of the game, and characters react to you in a more realistic fashion. The graphics are actually pretty good even though they are locked at low -_-. I also have to mention the menu design is gorgeous. Really dig the art design.

I'll put it this way I think it was worth 15$, but that's all it's worth at this point. 

Many people are complaining about DRM and having to be online or you get booted off while this only happened to me once I can absolutely agree with the hate. It's a single player game, this shouldn't be required. They obviously want to stop piracy, but it seems like there trying too hard. SE are you guys that broke that not only do you need to release in episodes to keep the project going, but you wasted money on some buggy DRM?

The Episodic release really pushed me away from hitman, I think it's a trend growing in the industry that absolutely shouldn't be. It worked with the walking dead, and that's where it should have stayed. It's not like the story of this game is so gripping you can wait for another portion. I mean for that matter there really is no story so far. There's a narrative, but nothing that's deep enough to warrant episodes. There basically releasing a game in pieces because they failed to finish it on budget, and on time. If this isn't the case I highly suggest you guys review your model. As it sits you got 15$ out of me, and you would've gotten the full 60$ had it been a full release. I'm not sure if I really want the rest, I kinda got the hitman hype outa me at this point.

The FPS lag is real, although my computer really didn't have trouble with it. Keep in mind I did have to turn it down from ultra to high, though, and it seemed to work. I'm also significantly over the recommended hardware requirements. It ran alright, but there were serious lag spikes in certain places. Definitely not that optimized. Also, the locked graphics thing was kind of a joke. I feel like you think were children when things like this are done. What's the point in putting graphics settings if you just going to dictate them anyways?

I had fun with it, and I guess there's more good than bad to a degree, but the bad is so blatant in your face it's hard to overlook it. I have to give this a thumbs down, simply as a sign of protest with what the AAA community tries to pull on its customer base. If this was not in episodes I would overlook much of the cons, but it all adds up to one stinky pile of sadness.

If you are on the fence, though, I do recommend you to buy the intro pack. Play the game for a bit, and leave a review. I only hope SE listens to its fan base and fixes some of this. If they do I will buy the full game and change my rating, but like most AAA titles the player base is ignored. If that's the case I will make sure they don't get anymore of my $$."

TL:DR - 1/10: If you ""NEED"" this, get it on console because this is a BAD port with always online DRM.

+ There's the ability to turn off all the terrible gameplay ""additions"" from Absolution.
+ The challenges encourage heaps of replayability.

- DRM. If you spend two hours in a level trying to perfect your playthrough, and for whatever reason you get disconnected... you get kicked out of the game and lose all of your progress. It isn't even saved. IO show no sign of removing the DRM, and keep insisting it's the best way to go. If this stays, do not buy this game. They must be taught a lesson.
- Player proximity scripting. This wasn't in Blood Money, but it was in Absolution. Unfortunately the game's realism and immersiveness takes a huge hit when you realize this game is filled with player proximity scripting.
- I know there is supposed to be more levels to come, but... after four years of waiting, the best they could do on launch is... one level...? I mean, it's a pretty good level, but still... one level...

Normally I am fine with episodic releases. But this is a low blow. I barely played the game, and I'm already done with it for this month. The online features are fairly barren, not enough to hold any interest. What is the point? I'm more likely to uninstall the game than to remember that another episode releases each month. An episode, mind you, that takes an hour to complete.

I'm supposed to go through the level multiple times, right? Well, that is boring, doing the level you just did, over and over. I'd much rather play a few levels, and then come back to an earlier one with more skill than I previously had.

Ok well for people wanting to buy this game I just want to let them know that first they must realize what this game consist of. First I will list the pros and cons of HITMAN. 

Pros:
- They went back to the roots of hitman allowing the player more freedom to do a mission, and explore without constraints.
- You are once again alloud to customize your weapon load outs before entering a mission. 
- Ai is a little more intresting, people in the game react to the way that you do things and conversations are brilliant. 
- The game has a 15 dollar option if you wish to just get the early cotent. 
- Key Mapping has become more expansive so you don't mix up actions in the game. 
- Contracts mode is still pretty great and makes the game replayable longer. 

Cons
- You must maintain a stable internet connection to HITMAN servers or it will boot you out of a game. (Hopefully saves recently)
- The game as of now only consist of 3 missions... If you Preordered you got to play the first 2 mission and then one PARIS mission on game release.   The Game is now episodic and I see this as a flaw only because I worry that we wont be getting many mission per release.  When I first though they were releasing paris I thought that ment a campaign for it with many missions... I was wrong and this was a major let down.   I am not sure how they plan to release the episodic content but if it is only one mission per month then this is a rip off. (They should have released a bigger game at launch and then after released episodic content in my opinion as DLC. )  Most people say they like the idea but I think it is rediculous, and perhaps the company got lazy and went for this approach. 
- If you dont like doing the same thing over and over to approach it for achievements this game will get old. 


My final opinion of the game is that the game was a weak release and I don't like this whole epidsodic thing they are doing.   I always expected a complete full game on release and they decided to give us content little by little.  On the plus side you can spend 15 dollars instead of the full 60 to play what is availible now in the game, but overall I think this approach is really stupid. Let me explain...    Lets say you know someone like me spends 60 dollars for the full hitman experience.   Ok now I have about 3 missions to toy with for a couple of weeks, little by little getting content.   Now a person that waits to buy the game can get a sale, lets say hitman hits the point where its 50% - 75% off.  At that point of sale maybe the game is just about finished releasing all it's content.  So the person that picks the game up gets the full experience at about the same time as me for a big fraction of the price.  Then I the person who bought the game in it's early stage that paid full price burned out on the game.  (Basically It is like the game is ALPHA unfinished but they call it this episodic thing)


If you love hitman and can't wait to play it and dont care that there is only 2 tutorial mission and one major mission availible then buy the game.  I have told many of my friends this without being pushy of my opinion at first and they thought this episodic and constant online thing was crap too.  I hope other games don't come in with the lazy attitude that they will release game like this and see it as acceptable.   ""Release little content on launch and slowly give packs of content along the way.""   Now the plus of this is maybe they can release some pretty awesome missions with alot put into them, but the down side I think is that they will not deliver many mission for each episodic release. (This is based on the original release.)


I do not recommend this game in it's current state and if you are wise you will wait for a major price drop when you can get the complete game for less money.   If you read all this and still feel you are dying to play hitman then perhaps pick up the 15 dollar pack and decide from that if you are still intrested in this.     I tried to put my opinions in the Hitman forums and got attacked by hitman diehards... I been playing hitman since the original release that was PC only,  I been a hitman fan for a long time.   However I am not defending a game I strongly do not love and this game is good but weak in content and I think this new way of delivering hitman content is bogus.

I give this game 5/10   If they had more content and didnt have the stupid constant online stuff perhaps it would or reached 8/10 or 9/10   and would of been one of the best hitmans yet."

Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is engaging and the world is thriving and bursting with personality, but there are some serious problems.

1. The game itself runs awfully. I am running it on an Alienware 18 Gaming Laptop, dual nvidia 880M's, i7 4930MX, 16GB RAM + SSD. Yes, by comparison, my laptop is not as powerful as say, a gaming desktop, but it should certainly be aqequate to comfortably run this game on at least medium settings. I have to lower literally everything to minimum to even get 20-30fps, and that is no exaggeration.

2. The game is absolutely HEAVING with bugs. To name a few:
- The game freezes for around 5-10 seconds every 10-15 minutes. At first, this may not sound like too much of an issue but when you're in the mits of combat this becomes extremelly annoying.
- Sometimes NPCs will start a conversation and then randomly walk in different directions, yet still be able to maintain the conversation whilst several rooms apart.
- If you use you fiber wire on a standing up enemy whilst you are prone, there is a good chance you will both glitch into the floor.

3. The AI is so friggin dumb. Want to spike someone's drink? No problemo, just do it right infront of the bar staff, they might ask you what you're doing, but if you make a quick enough exit, they'll forget about it almost instantaneously.

4. Always online. Personally, I have not had any connectivity issues, but this is going to be a serious problem for a lot of gamers who game on the go. This requirement desperately needs revising.

5. Way too short for an initial release. I mean seriously, it was over in an instant.

As it stands, I cannot recomend this iteration of hitman. This isn't a game, it's a BETA demo."

Graphics are no better than the last one.

Interesting STORY because its about the beginning of the career of 47.

Major problem : They releasse only one episode per month !

The levels are biggers than the other hitmans but in the end you end up doing the same mission over and over just changer your way to kill the targets. you still have the Contract mode but i the same levels....

If you are a SUPER FAN of hitman .  buy it now ( like me ) and  if you arent .   well you will be dissapointed  so i suggest to wait for the full version the comes out in 2017. and a least have the full game .

Absolution was the absolutely wrong direction to take and I think the developers have recognised this but...

HITMAN WoA is aimed in the right direction but is unfinished, unoptimised and IF it is actually beautiful (which I can't verify because it runs like a dog on medium settings) it wouldn't make up for the fact that they have asked for a full game price for a game that has about 3 hours of play (20% of which could be attributed to lag or problems derived from the consequences of lag). It feels like IOI realised what makes a good HITMAN and were taking WoA in the right direction but ran out of money and decided to release what they had, unpolished and unfinished.

In conclusion, as much as I'd like to say that WoA hits the mark, it doesn't. Maybe they missed the target because they were lagging too? Heh. I wish IOI would realise that they had the right recipe back in May 2006, when men were real men and Hitmen.. well they were real men with barcodes on their heads.

Big fan of the franchise and hate to see corporate greed destroy a great game. I get that no company wants or tolerates piracy but the consumers also don't like being treated as slaves. My personal attitude is: ""you make a great game and I will buy it for sure"". CD Projekt does not have denuvo or always online requirements, is being pirated and they still make a lot of money. Why? Because they have a great product and therefore don't have to worry if it will sell. They show me respect as a customer by not placing stupidly high levels of protection on their game and in return, I buy their product. Message to Square Enix and IO: ""less accounting, and more game making"". If games keep this trend of paranoid protection levels I will just simply stop playing. How will you make your money then? Respect the players, get respected by players.
Until the online issue is fixed this is a negative review. Game looks and feels great, but it's all ruined by the always online feature. I have wasted my money, people do not waste yours. Better to wait and see if they get rid of this nonsense. If they don't there are always other games."

1 - Obviously imposing online gameplay restriction even on story mode, is simply retarded.

2 - Story mode is practically none existent. Game comes with a single mission ( excluding the tutorial ).
      
     Having paid 60 $, i don't want to wait for anything to come out, i believe i was supposed to get a fucken full game.

3 - Having played story mode and a few escalation missions, i haven't gained a single additional weapon. Nor do i have a

    clue as to how i can aquire anything.

4 - Game Menu is a mess at best, badly designed, and leaves you wondering as to what the fuck is happening or what've 

    you actually achieved so far.

5 - Being used to previous hitman games, all i wanted is to have a decent story, and most emportantly some sort of 

    shack or baselike storage room where you can collect weapons and what not. Perhaps upgrade them as you go along.

6 - I simply find myself unable to collect anything, and the game gives no sense of accomplishement. Instead it's just 

     another farming game, where you're left playing the same mission over and over again in order to collect 20

    achievements. ( sure that has always existed, however it was optional and one could simply play the storymode ).

7 - I can go on forever, and i can't think of 1 single positive thing to write about this game. Shooting seems weird,

  no blood, no base, no weapons, no story, no self of personalisation, you can't accept your own missions, simply 

 imposed with useless contracts.

EDIT 23/4/16: This week's patch incorporated a reconnect option that allows you to reconnect to the game's servers should you happen to be disconnected during play (Thanks IO). This helps somewhat to solve the immediate frustration of having your gaming sessions disrupted, but still doesn't change the fact that the game is almost entirely single player, yet is unnecessarily hampered by draconian DRM and a pointless always-online requirement to access new equipment and unlocks. HITMAN may very well lose most of its content if the servers are shut down without the developers rectifying these issues. If the game wasn't so damn good I'd be boycotting the next episode(s) until they remove all of it completely, but I don't think I'll be able to help myself. Damn you Square Enix.

They should have held back and finished the game before releasing an unfinished product. I despise the episodic distribution method and will not recommend any games that are released this way. If i didn't go over my 2 hour play limit I would return it and wait for the full game which will probably cost less when all the missions are available.

So to sumarize just wait for the game to be finished, or don't buy it at all if you really want to send the devs a message."

I personally don't like this epsiodic theme. i think its better to release a full game with a bunch of levels and maybe a couple DLC's with extra levels later on. Other than that, its a great game, just what personally I've been waiting for; a hitman game similar to Blood money and the older ones where they drop you in a setting and you figure out the way to kill the target, not like absoultion where it was constantly sneaking. My computer runs this at 60fps on low. I have a i5 2500k and nividia GeForce GTX 770. All in all, the longer you wait to buy hitman , the smarter it is because more levels will be added every month, 


UPDATE:
As many people probably already know, the new episode is now coming out near the end of April, so basically waiting 2 months instead of supposly every month. So i won't be touching hitman now till this new epsiode and when i play the new one i won't touch it untill the next one. moral of the story, epsiodic games are not good at all because of the wait time, and on top when the company can't even release the new levels within everry month its definetly not a game to purchase.

First of all, i will say hokaido map design is impressive, it has gorgeus view. But the game still suck tho.

WIth final episode, I DON""T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE STORY????????????
Seriously guys, a shaddy guy come approach Ms. burnwood and say something. Then what???
No conclussion of the story, the game didn't feel end at all. In fact, like i said. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE STORY.... And i feel like the target by the story is just there, so we have someone to kill. They have no connection with the story at all.

I will rate this game 2/10.
I can play hitman 2: silent assasin again, it still more enjoyable than this game in term of story and game mechanic.

Hmmm control with joystick didn't feel right. So switched to keyboard & mouse.

Also the NPC feel too soon to blown my disguise :(

Here is the review after marrakesh episode out:

I already forgot about this game, i have lost interest with this game. Thanks to the episodic release, i already lost appetite for this game because waiting too long.

Probably i will play with this game again when all the episode out.

See you in next HITMAN game and don't expect me to buy pre-release or full price.

This is the review for the initial game release:

Bad bad bad, feel like unfinished game.

Shooting feel not right, there is no sensation at all when you shoot. I tried using controller and mouse. Nothing feel right. Hitman Absolution is better when shooting using controller and Hitman Blood Money still better if you using mouse. 

When you shoot, there is no blood. Is this game for kids? 

Controller aim assist feel not working, so RIP controller user. Because of this, you will prefer to use melee weapon :(

AI feel stupid and not live at all. 

Starting gun options only pistol. Looks like 47 run out of money.

Bigger map?
Yeah it's bigger but world feel empty. Basically what i feel is, the amount of content still the same it's just the distance got longer. I will prefer have smaller map with rich content.

The only thing i feel improved is disguised system, where now not all the guys using same disguise as your will recognise you.

If you're player who like do mass massacre for fun, you can cry. The amount of guards in here is uncountable. So basically you will dead before clean upall guards.

I did not get any issue with performance, i'm using NVIDIA GT 600 series.

TL;DR not recommended, wait another year and hopefully you will also get discount + fix
If you still insist, buy the intro pack."

I wasn't thrilled about the episodic release style, but I could live with it. I was a little miffed that *six months* after seeing the Showstopper playthrough on YouTube that's still the ONLY LEVEL IN THE GAME, but even then, I could look past it. Those two things aren't what make me give this a solid thumbs down. 

Requiring an intenret connection for what is fundamentally a single player game is colossally stupid. If you lose your internet connection or their servers go down even for a fraction of a second, you get immediately booted from your single player game. I figured oh well, I'll just play single player, right?

WRONG. Square Enix decided to offer an ""offline"" mode that cripples the game completely - no progression, no rewards, you're basically stuck with only the default options.

I'd *gladly* repurchase the full game - tiny amount of content and all - if they un-cripple their single player game in the absence of a permanently on connection to their servers. As-is, it's a load of bull, and I'm glad Steam got me a refund so that I can send a message to publishers - THIS IS NOT OKAY.

A Summary:
* no hotkey for weapons, first person or map
* ExitGame button is in settings-section (WTF? Console Sh*t. Ok, Alt + F4)
* no cold, dark, more serious sound/atmosphere (no jesper kyd music)
* no weapon buy/upgrading no money system (i do all missions for these boring challenges, rly?)
* no briefcase for sniper etc.
* no map for planning mode (where are the damn pickup points? guessing, every time)
* instinct - see through the wall (ah sure, superpower clone i forgot)
* button mashing melee combat -.- (Absolution legacy, hate console game features)
* no human shield
* no interesting briefing (as a hitman player i want to get an serious briefing from agency)
* no mission-end newspaper like blood money (this feature was so genius, the articles reflected your behaviour in missions)
* no Pro/Purist difficulty (there is no reward to do sth. in harder ways)
* no blood & no blood trails when dragging victims after shooting (its simply logical, or not?)

Its like Blood Money, but a lot of good old things are missing. Its no total crap-game, but it's just far less than it could have been. Dumbed down for casual gamers, many features missing, which they got right 10 years ago.

Escalations:
1. Kill Guy x
2. Kill Guy x and y
3. Kill Guy x and y and z
4. Kill Guy x and y and z and u
5. Kill Guy x and y and z and u and r

I figured I'd pick up the episodes which appealed to me, which was the main benefit I could see from using such a system.

With IO now independent, I thought I'd check out what has changed. Turns out, not much, and not for the better. Why can't I buy individual episodes? Why can't I buy ANY of them without buying the rediculously overpriced GOTY outfits? 

Seriously, why are reskinned missions and 3 outfits as expensive as the whole rest of the game I am interested in? I was excited to play. Now I just feel like IO is screwing me over."

Unfortunetly it's marred by some rather stupid decisions when it comes to DRM.

For starters, progression is locked to always online, you can't unlock anything in offline mode. If you're playing online and their servers go out (which has happened a lot, even as I'm typing this the servers are unavailable) you will be kicked out of your singleplayer game and not able to get back in until the online mode is working.

You can't pretend you don't have always online DRM if you restrict offline mode to a completely nuetered version for no reason.

It's not protecting the sales of this game, it's hurting it."
2380,2,0.4261,"online, server, always, save, connection, offline, mode, lose, connect, need","I'm writing this review while waiting for this single-player game to reconnect to its servers so I can continue playing from my latest savepoint because the game kicked me out of a mission due to a lost internet connection. In fact, just now the game threw the following message at me: ""Unable to connect to the HITMAN service. Failed to authorize your account with the HITMAN server. For more information, contact HITMAN support.""

My options at this point are to ""Retry"" or to ""Go Offline"". Retrying does nothing, going offline will let me start the mission again from scratch, but won't let me load any saves I made while I was online (even though I'm 99,9% sure that saves are stored locally and not in some cloud).

All the time while I'm writing this review the game is ""trying"" to reconnect to the servers (It has to be mentioned that my internet connection is fully functional at this point).

So here's what I'm asking myself right now: why is this even a thing? Why do I have to be online for a fucking single-player experience. I am not interested in making it to some leaderboards or something. Why does the game kick me out of a mission if I lose the connection? Dark Souls lets me play offline even though it's a much more internet-reliant game. This joke of a product doesn't.

I am sad because if you look past the always-online nonsense, the poor optimization and the fact that the game so far consists of just one mission (and two tutorial missions) you will see that the devs finally understood what the playerbase expects and wants from a HITMAN game and I won't lie, they actually tried to deliver.

However I can't look past those issues because at this point I am STILL not connected to the servers. In the end I am glad that I went with the intro pack rather than the ""full experience"" (which at this point is more of a ""fool experience""). I'm glad I didn't spend more than 13 euros on it and I am positive that I will not purchase future episodes."

HITMAN runs poorly - i run a 980TI/6700k/18gb system and i cannot for the life on me get a stable 60fps, hell i cant even get a stable 50 is some areas at high/ultra. The frames jump wildly from 45 frames to 60 in just a simple matter of moving from room to room and the graphics simply dont justify it. I run The Devision at a stable 60fps and it looks 10xs better than Hitman. 

I can live with the notoriously odd AI and the unrealistic shooting mechanics - because thats Hitman - i can live with the lack of animations from opening doors to quick to animations of dumping bodies and changing into costumes because thats Hitman - but couple that with it running awful and you lose any enthusism.

If, however, you are like me and cannot wait, the core game is rather fun. If you loved the Hitman series, the game stays mostly true to form. The size of the maps is impressive and offers a lot of potential for the coming updates. 

Like every other negative review here, the DRM issues cause problems, especially if you have a weaker internet connection. 
Buy it if you must, wait if you can. 
My review might change if the games is updated properly. 

Cheers.

Sadly I can't recommend this game as it is right now for the following reasons:
1. Episodic BS. I made the mistake of blindly buying the game. I had no idea it wasn't a full game. Needless to say, episodic missions is not something that works well with Hitman.
2. Always online DRM. This is a single player game, there's zero need for that, and the servers are so shaky that you can't really play a mission without the game booting you out when the servers crash.
3. The removal of difficulty in the game. I loved beating Absolution on the highest difficulty on the 1st try, the fact that you can't save and are forced time and time againg to try to get it perfect from beggining to end was one of the landmarks of the game. In this Hitman, you can save as much as you want, making the challenges pointless. What's the value of doing a 'Suit only' run when you can save every 5 seconds? there's no skill requirement left in this game.

I have a high end pc with a gtx 970 and an intel i5-4670k which together should be considered pretty much a high end PC. I know it's not the most powerful but It should make a game like this run at 1920x1080 @ 60 frames per second.

Well when playing it you think at first this is good, 60fps on problem. Then you go inside the mansion and see the huge crowds. you start heading for more 30-40fps. sometimes it can just freeze for a little bit, sometimes you had to put up with sub 30 frame rates. 

For PC games this is unacceptable. Why should we bother paying for pemium hardware if this is the kind of service that companies are going to give us. Sort your S*** out square enix. Either give us a working game or don't give us anything. 

It's a shame as if this didn't have poor framerates it would be a fun game. It's like bloodmoney but with absolution elements.

The levels are a nice start and should last the average player until the next dlc pack or whatever. I never gave a go of contacts but if it's anything like absolution then it should be enjoyable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Square Enix, lets talk. 

Kudos for making another Hitman game. I mean, the franchise is still profitable, so it's a bit of a no brainer to make one, amiright? But thanks for finally ending the wait. 

Now, you've done some good work in the past, and some good work here. You've hit your stride making the levels feel ""real"" with background conversations, and the ""immersiveness"" factor of letting you interact with bystanders and steal tools for use elsewhere really gives a lot of flexibility. It makes possible the whole ""do I shoot them? Poison them? Bomb them? Drown them?"" smorgasbord of death thing you've got going on, which is honestly somewhat entertaining. The effect of having many different ""right"" (not going guns blazing at everyone at sight - you're an assassin, not a terminator) ways of killing your target reduces my frustration at trying to divine the subtlest way of killing the target. It makes it ""easier"" (less time consuming) to kill my target because if one method fails I can switch to another, keeing me from scum-saving to hit a security hole or get to my target in a 3 second window or the like. You've made the levels themselves things of beauty, and the work you've done in giving targets and bystanders extensive dialogue and real ""lives"" really pays off here. They're no longer faceless mooks, and because they DO have personalities, I almost feel a little bad about killing them. Congratulations, you've made a game, and a very polished one, too. *golf clap*

That being said, what were you thinking? 

Okay, I get the temptation to try new things when making a game, and you've tried several new things here. Let’s take a look at your choice to make things “episodic”. The word means ""an event or series of events considered in isolation"", so I suppose it’s used appropriately. But in this episode, once you get past the training and “graduation” mission (NOT a mission) you have given me a grand total of… one mission. ONE. Yes, it's a mission with some of replay value as there are a thousand ways to die, but now I know how the level works from the first time, and my gameplay is now reduced to running around to unlock various triggers I know about to find one or two I don’t know about. One real map does not a “world of assassination” make, no matter how many different ways there are to complete it. You've provided ""challenges"" revolving around your 1000-ways-to-die level design model to unlock things like new guns, and I suppose that gives me an incentive to replay, no matter how contrived it is. You provide “escalation” contracts revolving around ascending difficulty levels to kill the same target again, in a previously played map, but in a harder setting this time, and you provide “featured” contracts which make me....oh. I replay the same level again and kill two different targets instead, sometimes wearing special clothing. I mean, I get some of these ideas – you HAVE to try new things, right? Otherwise how can you justify the $59.99 you ask? New is fun, right?

What were you thinking? Were drugs involved? You can TELL me!

I suppose I can understand why you did this – I mean, it’s pretty clear you’re looking to have me spend more time on fewer levels. By having users pick their own targets and trade “contracts”, it encourages playing with friends, which is the biggest single characteristic of the console crowd. I guess that makes sense, even if it seems kind of lazy, like someone has cut your art budget. But it’s not automatically bad! I mean, if people are happy replaying the same level killing…let’s see. I want….the construction worker on the third floor, and the escort on the patio. If they’re happy killing people like that, more power to them, right?

And I guess I see how it seems like having fewer missions (oh, I hope not) with greater replay value might work - but giving me these “challenges” doesn’t make a lot of sense in the world of Hitman. I mean, I have an agency backing me up, right? Why would killing the target with fireworks while dressed as a fashion model get me a new gun? In “Hitman: Blood Money”, I could buy intelligence on my target and pay to cover evidence. This provided a connection between missions – my success in the first carried through to later levels, and I couldn’t just load up on ammo and go Expendables on everyone in sight. Well, I could, but it would cost me a ton to get new fingerprints afterward.

What were you thinking? Were they blackmailing you? Did they have pictures? Is that why? You were young, and needed the money, right? 

I suppose if I were more cynical, I’d say that forcing players to spend more time on fewer levels is supposed to make Square Enix more money by having them spend less money in development in the first place. I mean, players still play the game a lot, but you only have to make one-half to one-third as many levels. The first episode had one training mission, one “graduation” mission, and the first assassination. If every new episode had three maps, we’d be looking at 15 more maps overall, which is a respectable game. But if the first assassination is the first “episode”, then you’re only looking at five new maps and a few cinematics! Cake!  But it’s also a good game for DLC, selling new gear or “micro-missions” with less work on each one. Better yet, having users make their own missions means less need for new official missions, period.

What were you thinking? We can HELP you! They have support groups for what you’re going through!

None of this covers your insane paranoia of the “constant connection” online DRM. I genuinely can’t see the point of it, as I’m not noticing any gameplay benefit I receive from it. However,  I generally don’t play user-generated missions. Given that the game is on Steam, itself a DRM service, it may be that the constant connection requirement is designed to support user-generated missions, itself a bad sign for the length and quality of future episodes. To put it baldly, Square Enix may be hoping the user-generated content, only distributable through the constant connection, will be the game’s selling point, making the “official” levels, playable on pirated versions without an internet connection, an inadequate reason to pirate the game . Or, why pirate the game if you only get six or seven levels, when all the “good” content requires a legit copy? (This theory is supported by the low ""intro pack"" price)

SQUARE ENIX, STOP THAT RIGHT NOW! BAD! NO! HOW DARE YOU BEND POOR AGENT 47 OVER A TREE STUMP AND THRASH HIM LIKE AN RENT BOY! NO! WE CAN HELP YOU, SQUARE ENIX! THERE ARE PILLS! I….NO! NOT THIS!! NOOO!!!

I'm rewriting this review after spending more time with the game. I like the game, but they shouldn't have released it in March. Their September announcement said six campaign, three locations, forty signature kills, contracts mode with 800 targets and weekly live hits and events. That's the bit I saw and thought wow this game sounds awesome. I never saw the January announcement that said we're getting what I have now. After seeing the September announcement I fully planned on buying the full experience. I completely screwed up for not paying more attention but in all fairness to me, who would expect they would need to keep an eye out for this kind of change? Now all I have is one location, some occasiona escalation contracts, and the normal user contracts. Elusive targets have been pushed back until April. On top of that the game does have problems. People and items fall through the floor a lot. I've had weird graphics issues at times too. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy the game at least as far as the one story mission goes. The escalation contracts just aren't my thing.

I don't recommend buying this game yet... or at least not yet. Some will love it and defend it to the end and blame the people who expected to get what was announced in September for not paying enough attention to the later announcements about changing how this release worked. Again, who would expect such a drastic change to happen mid January when the game is due out mid March? I don't game a lot, but I figured the last three months would just be for polishing the first three locations up. Then the next three locations would be polished up in the month to come before they are released. There was all this promised live content but all there is are a few escalation contracts every week and a half or so. Basically for those you're killing one of the NPCs in increasingly ""difficult"" ways; more like odd ways. I mean seriously, why would any hitman where a vampire magician outfit to carry out a hit on anyone?

The little bit of the game we have is good. Trust me when I say you should wait or at least don't buy the full experience like my idiot self did. I remember what was announced in September went on steam pressed purchase for the full experience because I was all in since September and was confused as hell where the rest of the game was. Go back and do some internet searching and felt both lied to and like and idiot for noy paying more attention. 

It boils down to this. You buy the full experience now and you'll be frustrated with the constant deplays for content and patches to fix problems with the game. I've noticed on forums the people using consoles are having a really bad go of it.

""On release players have access to the Intro Pack content - Prologue Mission, the Paris Sanguine Fashion Show, full access to Contracts Mode, Escalation Mode, elusive targets and other live content. Remaining content will be available as six releases periodically throughout 2016, starting April 2016.""

The way I read this was that you had different contracts and different modes and they would be releasing content throughout the year, like DLC.   I thought contracts were more like side missions.  In reality, all contracts really do is allow you to kill someone else in the same missions you get on release.  No going to California and killing some movie star.  You can kill the same NPC's over and over again with the 2 training missions and one ""full"" mission until more content is released.

 So if you enjoy doing the same mission and trying to kill the marks a bunch of times in different ways, this game is for you. 

This could have been a really good game and it might still, but at this point I cant say I would recommend it to anyone.  Bascially you are paying a premium price for a partial game with the promise of future missions."

And by looking at the screenshots / gameplay and doing the benchmark available this game shouldnt have been any different.

But no Hitman™ (2016) Locks/greyes out your graphics settings according to (atleast) your Video Memory INCLUDING RESOLUTION. So if you have a monster PC with overclocked parts and still highly viable GPU setup, that has performed admirably to this point it stops here. 
This game doesnt care if you can run witcher 3 with all maxed and still enjoy acceptable FPS. 
It cares even less the fact that ppl can't suddenly change their display / native resolution as they could forexample downgrade texture quality or other eye candy to balance the performance. 
The game have decided that its better for you to run the game with blurry downscaled resolution (beacuse thats the dream of every 1440+ resolution owner)  than to either take the performance hit or balance it out from somewhere else, and no you dont have any say in this, not even with reg edit.

I dont need the stable 144fps on singleplayer tittles.
I dont need the ultimate best textures necesarily if they truly are so taxing for my old pc.
I dont need the sharpest shadows.
I dont need the highest possible anti aliasing or anti aliasing at all.

have to go through the tutorial again like i did in the beta.. no big deal i expected that.

Finally onto my first real mission...
Beat it in about 15 minutes..
Thats it...

yeah i know this is supposed to be ""Episode based releases"" but
even then.. its really not that good. The AI is trash you can literally get in a closet with them looking at you and they will walk away.

releasing this game like this was a terrible idea.. and it shows in the amount of negative reviews they are getting.. this was just a terrible idea. the 2 maps that yous tart with feel unenjoyable to replay because tou know they are ""training missions"" and that the weapons arne real. and yeah nothing is really different.. but its a mental thing that they did too well. but the real level was amazing dont get me wrong. but i wanted to binge play this crap out of this.. and i cant.

Thats all the game was...
3 ""Mock up"" training scenerios and 1 REAL mission.
then there is nothing. it gives you several objectives to do on the SAME 3 maps
to earn mastery points which doesnt really seem like it does anything,.. then it lets you 
create your own missions which is neat but again.. same levels..

WHOS IDEA WAS THIS?!?!?!?

if you look past the tutorial... you just paid 60 dollars for ONE LEVEL

After starting the game and getting into the tutorials I was excited to finally get my teeth into an actual mission where I can basically do what I want; moving onto the Paris mission I was excited to basically be given the run of the map, chosing my disguises and basically blending in where possible, my first attempt I completed the mission with a negative score of -22000 where I just decided to go gungho at the end while escaping, which I thought was fair because I didn't do it in a stealthy manner, I then noticed I was getting ""Mastery Levels"" for the current mission, I thought to myself, this is pretty good I can come back to this mission and try out some other starting locations. Cinematic kicks in and im thinking yeah this games on point so far. Cinematic cuts and it takes me to debrief, and no other mission.. I had to consult my friend and he told me that the game is episodal; which as soon as I heard I immediately regretted my purchase.

I spent £40 on this game for the ""FULL EXPERIENCE"" only to the be shit on by being told I will get a mission a month? What is this.. its not a Telltale game.. I have just paid £40 for a games I'm not going to be able to progress in for atleast 6 months.. what is this bullshit.."

I now need to wait until April to get the next part of the story mode and I ask you is this really what you want for £40?

Therein lies the problem.

The controls - like the original are clunky as hell. If something should go wrong (and it will) there's no quick way to access your weaponry. For that matter, there's no quick way to access any of your gear or equipment either it seems.

Graphically, this can't be counted as a 2016 game. At best, it looks like a 2016 port. Playing on maxed graphics, the world looks fine within about 50m, nothing special, but not terrible. Beyond that, character models jerk and jank around while moving so badly you'd think they were a badly done stop-motion video.

The other big problem is the always-on DRM. It's a single player game that has always-online DRM. Enough said.

If you're a fan of the series, it's not a bad successor, but there's no way this game is worth the currently asked price. Let it drop to $30 at a MAXIMUM before getting it."

Let's start with the pro's of this game, the scenery looks spectacular, I have a 970GTX on my PC and it's running smoothly with settings on high at 1600x1280 utilising the DX12 option.  The combat is fluid, yet somehow choppy.  Unfortunately, this is where the pro's end for me.

So the negative stuff, There are literally 3 levels, seriously 3 and 1 of those is a training mission.  The developers decided to create additional challenges, for example, to poison your target or make it look like an accident.  Really, you expect us to play the same level, over and over and over.  Perfectionists, would do this but not everyone.  I think it's lazy that only 3 levels get released with more to come, provided you have the ""Full Experience"" package.  It's bad form when you feel ripped off and left wondering, exactly how many levels are there in the ""Full Experience"" package? 5? 7? 10?  Give us something for goodness sake.

I found a few glitches, the most painfully obvious being the requirement for an online connection, if your connection, drops, you have to wait until the connection resumes again inorder to be able to carry on.  Picture the scene, you managed to get the disguise you want, your hiding in a cupboard, the target walks past you, you leap out and then you lose connection and are forced back to the main menu.

Other glitches include a few clipping errors, like when you subdue a security guard and his body drops through the floor.   If you want the full experience, wait until ALL the levels are released and then purchase.  It's not a good idea to purchase a game that is clearly in Beta and not fully released or polished and be expected to pay the full price.  Let's hope future levels are worth the wait.

I gave this game a negative review for the little rant below, but now I realize that this game really is bad. I've had about 5 times where I'd be in the middle of a map and the always online DRM would pop off and I couldn't play anymore. Come the fuck on. Really!? This is a single player game!? I get ""Oh we don't want cheaters"" It's a single player game, what are they gonna cheat on? Achievements? Are the players gonna get money for getting an achievement by doing a sly little hack. Really Square Enix? you took a great game series, made a meh, but generally good game, then go back to the roots of the series to shit all over it.

As someone who absolutely adores the Hitman series, I was absolutely disgusted with Absolution. Absolution was not a Hitman game, but it had a Hitman story line at least. This game is a ""revamping"" of the series, but holy cow are my expectations not met. I understand you can pay $60 for the full game that will come out over time. However, how in the hell is one big (fun might I add) map, and two small tutorial maps supposed to keep an audience busy for months on end. It may sound greedy, but until the map list expands, and possibly adds some other features like maybe a steam workshop so creation in unhindered, anyway enough of this rambling should you buy this? No, unless you've got money on your hands and just want to spend it for an OK Hitman experience.

TL:DR
Don't buy this unless you're really craving to drown people in toilets and have a thick wallet."

So my recommendation is: Don't buy the game yet. Even though it will take a while, wait til they release all the ""episodes"" (levels), and while the graphics are amazing and gameplay is well executed, finishing the tutorials and the Paris mission didn't feel as compelling and rewarding as Blood Money did in its Prologue level.

new map was added, and if there is a disconnection from game servers, it is now possible to reconnect without loosing game progress. Also loading saved games now correctly loads information about chalenges and other stuff. But That is all for the good news.

The bad news is that the disconnections do still occure. Worse bad news is that the game gets unstalble after a while and craches simlpy as time passes. I have a save game whis is not finishable, because the game crashes aproximately 3 minutes after I load it, sooner if I kill someone. huh. WTF?

Anyaway, the new map is not realy good. I would say that it looks really great at first but actually it is much worse that the first map. Main thing which I do not like is that there are some predefined routes, but If you want something as easy and simple as open/break a window that is not opened from the beginning (even from inside), you are out of luck. How lucky we are we that at least doors can be opened as expected. Runing over the roof is only allowed on thre (I think) places. Not to mention climbing on anything (wall, hill, rock) - it is not possible, unless there is a sharp ledge to hang on. oh well, another WTF. It really gest booring by now. 

Well, I think that this is more that enough update, for now. I will wait for another update/patch before even trying to play the game again, because I am now stuck with unfinishable savegame after some 4-5 hours and well, I have no intention wasting another single hour on any replay atemp unless I am pretty sure I will be able to at least finish the level...

So. I still do not recoment the game. Actualy if it was possible, I would recoment it much less than I recomended it earlier (and yes, I did NOT recomented it earlier). 


Original post bellow (was valid before second level (sappienza) was released):
I will not say anything about the game itself as it is absolutely UNIMPORTANT compared to how unstable the game is.

My fist day (day of the release) experience was OK, but today (next day) it keep keeps crashing like 1x per hour and I got disconnected several times, which forced me reload, which does really made me angry (since I try to save as less as possible) and it looses all progress and sending me to the game menu. 

And no, it was NOT problem on my side - my connection was perfecly fine and working all the time.
 
Also, I forget to mention, that the finished oportunities and chalenges are NOT displayed correcly when game is reloaded. Some do still couts as finished when the mission ends, but it is a bit hard to keep trak of all of these since there are so many of them a well, basicaly they are the only reason I stick with the game after finishing the level for the first time. Which means it realy DOES break my game experience.

So. I can not recommend this game. Instead I recomment to anybody STAY AWAY until they can make the game  (at least) does not crash when interet connection to their lousy servers fail.

If there would not be for those, I would be quite satisfied with the game (knowing it is not a finished game), but as things are right now, I really do regret that I have bought it in its present state."

The game seems to be badly optimized, even on lowest of the lowest details it's barely playable (especially Paris mission, where there's much to render).

I'd say okay to this, even if it meant that I can get achievements only on-line - that's fine. But not getting the whole game under lock-down and depended on developer's servers, that's just a huge NO.

I pay - I demand full functional product. As it is now, it's great topic for lawsuit for the product not meeting the agreement. By buying I agreed for functional game, not something that's in development.

Decent Hitman game, I would recommend this if you are a fan or want more of Hitman Blood Money. If you are a fan of Absolution, I would also recommend this. It's less linear and returns back to the original Hitman experience. Note that this game requires you to be online to experience the ""full"" game experience to ensure you aren't a pirater, and I often get disconnected from the servers and lose my progress. Story is released in an episodic format and seems to work well so far.
However, performance as of when this review was written is [b]ABSOLUTELY[/b] horrendous. I'm running a dual GTX 980Ti and am running this game @ 1440p. This game shouldn't even be a problem for my GTX 980Tis and I should've been able to run it at at LEAST a constant 60 FPS.

Instead, it dips down to 20-30 FPS every few minutes for a good 10-15 seconds. Therefore, do NOT buy this game until they have patched the performance. As for now, even with my rig, it's hard to play it.

Instead a pop up shows up, stops you from playing, and gives you a choice : retry connexion, or go offline. This gives you a chance to fix whatever caused the loss of connexion, if it's on your side.
But if the issue is due to a server maintenance (which happens mostly when they are implementing an upcoming patch for any plateform), you have no choice but to go offline.
_____________________________________________________________
Edit 28.06.16 : they confirmed the online necessity was not meant as a DLC. I guess it's just pure data mining then. And they also said they will stand by it. I guess the last hope regarding this point is the future disc version...

But another little something comes ruining my appreciation for their market practice.
They initially said ""we will give you 6 episodes and absolutely no DLC"".
And now because they are mid-season and are probably really late for the rest of it, they decided to release a 7th ""BONUS EPISODE"". Guess what though? You can only have this ""bonus"" for free IF you bought the ""upgrade pack"" or ""full experience"" (= SEASON PASS MUCH). If you decided to buy each episodes when they come out, YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.
So instead of paying 50€ like ""full experience"" owners, you'd initially pay 54€, because 13+ 5*8. I decided to go with it. ""Meh okay, 4€, it aint much more, I'd rather not risk taking the whole thing yet"". But now we have to pay 62€, which is 12€ more than if you had bought the ""season pass"" as they wouldn't call it. ""NO MICROTRANSACTION"" then ""oh but we add a bonus you never heard of until it was too late that fucks you of some more cash  now that its too late to buy the season pass because you already bought the 3 first episodes""

TL;DR of this edit : SEASON PASS or +12€ for a ""BONUS EPISODE"" even though they said they won't make any DLC.
_____________________________________________________________

I WILL change this NO to a YES... if and only if that online bs is fixed.
So, I won't bother repeting anything that's been said hundreds of times here already.

Just this : I expected this game to be a disappointment. It actually is QUITE NICE. But this online DRM, it's just a BIG NO NO for me.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

There is already DENUVO in the damn game, why add an online DRM, seriously?!
Why do I love single player games? Because my internet is too bad for multiplayer games!
Why would a single player game FORCE ME to play ONLINE to unlock SINGLE PLAYER content? NO REASON except greed maybe.
Multiple ONLINE games don't force you to be online to unlock stuff : Payday, Killing floor, CS GO achievments can be made offline then will be unlocked once you're online. SO WHY WOULD A SINGLE PLAYER GAME DO THAT?
I > can not < play the game as it is right now.
I'm not even gonna talk about the servers that are unstable and kick me out of the game etc, because I don't WANT them to fix the SERVERS, I wan't them to get rid of the necessity of the online.

So, IO, SE, know this : I bought your intro pack without knowing that was gonna be a thing. But I will > NOT < buy the remaining of the game if you don't change that very specific point.

Now, the game itself it pretty good I guess. I'm afraid it's gonna be too short tho, even once it's complete. And some 'unlockables' should NOT be unlockables, they should be in the base game. And yes, there are a few bugs. Game breaking ones for some of them. But I trust they will be fixed, considering how many people complain about it.
Though, it does feel like a beta... this game really is a pre-access beta in disguise..."

i cannot recommend this game at all.

let me take you back to 2003,
everyone had a ps2, borrowed 2 games from a cousin,

wwf smackdown:here comes the pain.
hitman 2: silent assassin.

me and my friends would run though smackdown in a couple short bursts for fun as a group.

but hitman 2, for us, was like chess, 
who was smart, resourceful, and observant enough, 
to beat the level without dying,
it wasnt easy or forgiving in anyway shape or form,
and we loved it.

bought every single hitman game since then,
absolution was a freak of nature that fractured the fanbase,
a cosplay of hitman, more batman than hitman.

i lost hope,

i thought hitman 6 would stoke the fire of my passion for the hitman franchise,
""finally, a return to form, a game for us old school hitman fans""
but that return to form was more of body snatcher than an old friend.

i was wronged again,
an early access trash heap with a technical issue that is preventing me from progressing.
for every glint of hope, i wash dashed with the darkness of truth.

[u]The game is not time-cycled[/u]

now this is a real game breaker for me,
no spontanious actions or targets wandering from what i've seen,
the targets only discuss ""their actions"" when im around,
and only move when im around, 
script trigger nonsense not befitting of the hitman franchise.

[u]No FPS mode[/u]

in the older hitmans you had a fps camera mode,
it made interactions and decisions much more tense,
you had to remember map layouts and patrols from quick map glances,
should you choose to play that way, 
it was just another dimension to the game that made hitman great.
speaking of map....

[u]Viewing the map pauses the game[/u]

say i was to turn off batman vision, minimap, and all the other handholders,
and i would have to rely on the menu map for my info,
well it pauses the game,
could be a plus for some, but a negative for me,
the old map blood money map was live,
npcs and targets wandered as i was reviewing the map layout,
and since this game was meant to be blood money successor,
its absence is a glaring one.

[u]no customisation[/u]

there was a reason to silent assassin missions in blood money,
you could get better gear and weapons.
which midigated the games difficulty to a degree,
it feels as though there is no incentive, other than a ranking,
to silent assassin a level, no reward for doing so, 
just a checklist that amounts to nothing.

[u]ALWAYS ONLINE????[/u]

why, just WHY?
its a singleplayer game,
there isnt even enough content now to justify it being always online,
and why arent saves cross-compatible?
with denuvo, it pretty much ensures that custom gamesaves are a no no,
why cant it be uninvasive always online?
meaning i just get contract updates and whatnot,
beat them offline and upload my scores or whatever
instead of relying on it to play the damn game.


as for the issue i mentioned at the beginning,
i cannot play the final test mission,
just constantly crashes whilst watching the ingame intro or skipping it to play.
it just crashes.
even after the tutorial missions ran without a hitch,
its baffling that they would even consider releasing it in this state,

my closing words are these,

this game isnt for hitman fans,
and judging by their release schedule,
it isnt even for regular gamers.

too hard for casuals,
too easy for hitman fans.

not enough content to satiate either appetites, 
one mainline episode to hold our attention until the next release?
better games maybe out by then,
and not enough content to justify the always online.
performance issues abound, with dx12 apparently broken.

eidos got away with murder on this one,
and just like the tititular hitman,
we arent even aware of its death yet."

2511,0,0.585,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","If you're alright with an experience roughly 3 or so hours long on a single playthrough, I can wholeheartedly recommend the game. My biggest complaint is that there just isn't that much content there, don't get anything but the $15 option if you want to play it right now.

As you can see from my time played, if you like replaying missions to achieve different objectives and learn new things about the map, you can get a ton out of the game. The map doesn't feel as big as the marketing made it out to be, but there's plenty of space to experiment with for things.

Overall, I would compare the game to MGS:GZ (in a good way, I loved GZ). It's a taste of what's to come, and one of the most solid stealth levels I've played through in a long time.


Update after the game is finished:

I cannot recommend the game anymore. Half the levels were lazy in their execution, and the devs stumbled at every turn in delivering on content. The issues with the always online system were never resolved, and out of the entire game, only a handful of missions are any good.

If you want to play the game, get the first level, second level, and last level. Skip everything else, it's not worth the time."

This game was ported rather poorly to PC as i run a  GTX 980 g1 on an x99\ i7 5820 and still get frame drops from time to time. this should not happen ever...

There's basically training, then tutorial,a quick level then that's it.

After nearly 13 hours I finally finished the first ""episode"" of this game. That doesn't include all of the different ways to take out the targets so there is plenty more to do. I watched a few playthroughs on Youtube and that helped  in getting a better handle on the game. 

For instance now I know that to put your weapon away you don't have to go into your inventory and switch to a coin or lockpick. You just have to hit Caps Lock (PC) and it will dissappear. There are a few large weapons that it doesn't work for but that's ok.

What I like. 
Agent 47 has never been more sleek and handsome but he retains his signature mean glare.

What I don't like

TL:DR: This could be as Good as Blood Money, in a few months! But do Not buy it now, because you will Hate every second of the roughly 40mins-1hour of gameplay included in this release! Bad AI, bad DRM, multiple choice linearized, fake-sandbox missions, with illogical scripted events. Also always online, locked options, and unoptimised in every way. Console controls are fine, but PC controls are badly set up. Mediocre graphics and animations compared to hardware needs.

The whole thing feels like the old blood money engine torn to pieces by someone who never done any coding, and after ruining it with high-res stuff and console code from Absolution, stuff it was never meant to handle, that same person put it back together while being drunk and paying attention to a stripper instead of his work.

Here are some details:

- the GRAPHics look like Blood Money looked on lowest setting, because some important quality settings are locked and cannot be changed unless you have insanely over the top hardware. This is so the game doesn't crash on you as it is not optimised and the engine code is probably a shameful mess. It could be a good looking game, because the art is there, you're just not allowed to see it unless you bought the highest-end GPU possible. Frame rates are pretty bad considering the very low ""quality"", clearly no optimization was done.

- Where's Agent 47 ? And by this I mean, where's the cloned superhuman we got to play throughout the series? This time 47 is slow, week, and now has eagle vision for no apparent reason! Taking out two man standing right next to each other from behind with a heavy object like a fire extuingisher  takes over 40 seconds of slooooow animations playing! My 87 y.o. grandma can hit two guys over the head with a fryingpan faster and harder than 47!!!

-You have literally zero chance of taking out two peaple at the same time. This leads to the total linearity in every mission. Two guards protecting a doorway? Get the right disguise or get lost! 
You are constantly led around the levels this way, making for a boring experience of trying to find out what the designers wanted you to do. There is now a ""right"" way of doing a mission, and everything else is wrong and leads to instant death by guards. Stray off this designated path, and you are busted. No freedom, no creativity, no thinking about it. You can't take your chances with situations any more. You can't just observe and be smart about it. Do as you are supposed to or die. There is no tension anymore, as you can only find out the ""right"" way by trying and trying and trying, and thus reloading and reloading and reloading a savegame from 2 minutes ago, because the ""right"" way is often illogical until you accidently trigger a script making someone move or do something totally unrelated to the situation.

- the gameplay does have an Always Online element to it, and it is bothersome because the game throws you out the instant it looses connection to the server. Which it will! The servers are unstable still, hopefully this will get fixed. Update: servers seem to be a bit more stable, I could get almost an hour of gameplay in without getting disconnected.

- As stated above, SCRIPTED AI actions ruin the fun of watching, waiting and planning. Instead you have to try to trigger these scripts to see which one does what as they are 100% unrelated to your actions or surroundings, and re-run the mission to get your target to where you want him. This makes up the fake ""sandbox"" part, and thus gives you ""one way to do it only, 100% linear"" actions to choose from. So, no freedom what so ever.  Remember how the good old Hitman games were like puzzles you could examine, learn, and solve in many fun ways? Now there is no puzzle, just a stupid maze with no logic or thought behind it, you are just being forced down the road you choose. 
- generally the AI is erratic, and mostly dumb, so are some of the setups of who will recognize you in a disguise

- the PC Controls are tacked on, keyboard layeout is for at least 3 arms and 17 fingers on each hand. It feels like a console port no one payed any attention to (example .:Push X to get up on a ledge, but push space to climb down? WTF) Also mouse look is lagging, even around 40-60fps, so aiming in a tight situation is ranging from a pain to impossible, depending on how much the framerate stutters at that moment. Push i for inventory? whats this, an rpg from 15 years ago? Mouse wheel is not assigned in any way? Others said that gamepad support is okay-ish, but I found out that if you want to use the kb+mouse instead you really have to disconnect/disable everything else, even HOTAS and Steering Wheels because the game will try to use them as it would use an xbox gamepad! So if you want to play with keyboard and mouse, unplug all your other controllers!

- ANIMations, like stashing someone in a freezer, are a mess, they look incomplete and unrefined, compared to BM or Abs. Animations like these take ages, despite the fact that they are cut in the middle of the action for some reason. Also 47 stands like his elbows are stuck to his waist with superglue, and so he walks in a silly way. All characters have a very basic motion set, which feels rehashed from Blood Money, or older as they are even less realistic.

-PHIsics are about as bad as any non-simulated game would be from 10 years ago, most of it feels fake and unreal, and not even in the cool ""blown away 500yards by a headshot"" way. Also, remember how in Blood Money, Absolution, and all AssCreed games you could push through the crowds, and they would flow around you and such? Well here the crowds are like ghosts standing in place, with absolutely no regard or reaction to you. Also you will walk through them, literally! They wont move aside enough, you won't get pushed aside, just pass through each other! Come on Devs, you did a way better job years ago, what the heck? I have to give them one good point though, for the cloth simulation of skirts and such, that's better then most of the stuff I've seen!

- AUDIO is one of the finer points of the game, apart from NPC conversations getting cut mid-phrase if you get too close, it's pretty decent so far. Ambience is nice, and positional audio works fine. Music could be better but that's a question of taste, for me it's entirely forgettable, unlike the previous games.

Conclusion: 
- But does it feel like Hitman? Yes and No. The scripted bit with the linearized ""right ways"" ruins the pretty okay-ish Hitman atmosphere entirely! Buy it in a few months when all the other issues are fixed, if that ever happens, and the later levels may turn out to be more fun."

No major performance issues that I noticed.

Paris level is a dream come true
   Stealth players have a  variety of ways to eliminate their targets allowing them to be more creative in their planning.
   Like to go in guns blazing? There are so many npcs walking around you could spend hours making sure every witness has been eliminated.

CONS:
The 2 hour refund window. 2 hours simply isn't enough time for someone to make an informed decision on a game like Hitman where the true objective is to eliminate your target unnoticed, be a ghost if you will. You could easily spend those 2 hours simply doing recon work at the fashion show.

Players only interested in finishing the missions can burn through all them in an hour (give or take). Note: The mission list includes the 2 tutorial ones on the boat, a final test, and then Paris.

For me this game did not want to connect to the servers. When I was lucky enough to actually connect and get into a mission I would lose connection and get sent back to the main menu. This happened repeatedly for 3 1/2 hours making me ineligible to refund the game. Steam seems to not give any leeway on the 2 hour policy, even if your actual time spent in a loaded level is considerably less. 

Conclusion:
Your play style will definitely affect how you view this game in its current state. 
Probably not worth the risk for most people at the moment but could be worthy of high praise in the future.

Note: Contracts and Escalation were not tested because of the connection issues."
2542,2,0.3078,"online, server, always, save, connection, offline, mode, lose, connect, need","Wow, where to begin with this game.
Lets start off with the ""non-required"" required server connection. Allow me to elaborate - you can still play the game when you're offline, you just can't choose ANYTHING. Can't change weapons, can't change starting location, etc. without an internet connection.
Then there's the issue of how terribly unoptimized this game is. EVGA GTX 970 here OC'ed to 1500 MHz can only manage a stable 30 fps in the first real level at medium settings. What do the devs expect people to run this game on, 4-way SLI GTX 980s?
Then there's the entire ""episodic"" format they're running with. Generally, games like this give you a bit more to play with at a time. With HITMAN, you get two training missions and one real mission. Just ONE. I understand they're going to release more over time, but really? For $60 I expect at least 3 or 4 missions at launch, maybe 2 if the other two issues weren't here and the levels were nice.

tl;dr: always online, no frames, one level. Wait for these problems to get patched before buying this game."

[h1]THIS IS A MIXED REVIEW! TL:DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION![/h1]
Hitman: Enter a World of Assassination is a third person, stealth, assassination game. There is flexibility in how you play to accomplish your mission, but running in guns-blazing like an action shooter is probably not the most effective way.

In Hitman, you playing as Agent 47, and your objective is to kill any targets you’re assigned while minimizing collateral damage. You will find weapons, and tools that will help you, and allow you to kill your target in different ways. Unless you can find a clean shot, you will need to gain access to your target first. You can use distractions to lure people away, and subdue, or kill them. Then steal their clothing to disguise yourself and infiltrate their inner circles. You can also try to sneak passed using lock picks and crowbars, without using disguises, but if you get caught, you may be escorted out of the area for trespassing. You also want to avoid leaving bodies or weapons around, otherwise you may drawn suspicion. Some people can see through your disguise, so you have to be aware of their presence, and you can do this with your x-ray like ability that lets you see through things.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list][*]several options for gameplay, audio, and graphics settings
[*]fully customizable controls and controller support
[*]the gameplay was as expected with the use of weapons and disguises to infiltrate and kill your target in a variety of ways
[*]the opportunities is a nice feature, but it also has the potential to make the game easier, so it might not be appreciated by everyone
[*]the sound effects and voice dialog were well done
[*]manual save slots as well as auto saves are very helpful for doing the 'perfect' runs[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list][*]the story that you learn is still lacking content, and many of the details are still unknown; although it's growing more intriguing, I still want MORE in terms of story
[*]servers being down: only the main story is available in offline mode, everything else required you to stay online and connected to their servers (that aren't always working)
[*]if you drop from the server during any contract mission, you get kicked out of the mission completely, it's frustrating
[*]some issues causing you to drop the body when dragging it around doors or corners
[*]some characters clipping through each other in more densely populated areas[/list]

Episode 1 was alright, but fairly short and simple. I enjoyed episode 2 the most so far because the map was larger, and I found it more challenging. Episode 3 was roughly on par with episode 1 as far as the difficulty.

The game also has a contract mode, which are different kill orders you can complete, but you play on the same levels from the tutorials and story mission. The contract targets are in different areas though, so you may have to alter your tactics to succeed. However,  you can only access the contracts, and almost all the content outside of the main story line while you are ONLINE AND CONNECTED to the Hitman servers. If the server dies while you are on a contract mission, you get kicked out of it, and that was frustrating. However, I didn't notice any connection issues while playing episode 2 or episode 3, but I am still not a fan of the online DRM.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
If you’re interested in playing the game for it’s story campaign, I still I suggest waiting for ALL of the episodes to be released before even thinking about making a purchase. If you plan to do mostly contracts, compete for the high scores, and get achievements, then you might be able to get a bit more enjoyment out of the game as it is right now... That’s of course assuming their servers are working. Needless to say, I'm growing less disappointed in this purchase as more episodes release, but I'm still not convinced of the full price purchase. I will continue to update as the final two episodes release.

2545,0,0.3914,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I came up with the 14.99 because I believe in this series.  Blood Money is probably one of the most fun games I have played (I still play it very frequently, coming up with different ways to play the missions).  Yes, Absolution took the wind out of my sails, but it happens.  Every series has a rough spot.  

So I pay for the preorder, and the beta seems very familiar.  It's as close to blood money as I could imagine it being, and I got excited.   I played through the trainer levels (which worked superb) and was stoked for launch day.  Launch day comes, my game is preloaded, I press play, and...

Nothing.   I check file integrity.  Run as administrator.  Everything I know to do.  The game will only work if I set it to DirectX 12 (which my card does not support).  So, at this point, I'm on day two of owning this game, and I can't play it.  I've searched forums for answers to no avail.  

I was alright with how they were spreading out the game.  A map a month.  Gives them time to focus on a particular map and make the game stronger.  If the map was already done, they could focus on the online aspect.  Make it stronger.  Make it better.  Unfortunately, now instead of getting to work on the next level, they need to fix what's already out.  What's already broken.  

Ubisoft, Square Enix, and any other developer, mark my words.  If you continue to release broken shit, you are going to ruin the community you have strived so hard to maintain the attention of.  Your core audience.  How difficult is it going to be to release games with no money because no one will buy the latest AAA release because they want to wait a few months because they know it's going to be worthless experience until that point?"

I loved every single one all the way up to and including blood money. 

After that they tried to change the formula and press some sort of story down our throats instead of following what actually works for this franchise and that I am sure NOBODY asked for, but I still remained a customer and purchased the titles and played through them. And I really liked the beta as it felt like good, old blood money and I was happy.

I have not had any technical issues with this game, but I still cannot recommend it for a very big reason.. WHERE IS THE CONTENT?? GOOD LORD!! Two training levels and ONE story mode level and see you next month?? 

What corporate shill thought this was ok? Jesus!

So for now, based upon almost NO content (Yea, yea you can finish the missions in so many ways just like it used to be BUT WHEN THAT IS THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE GOING FOR YOU THAT IS A PROBLEM) I just can't recommend it.

Maybe with some more content, but that remains to be seen. 

Seriously.. The lack of content shocked me. I thought there would be atleast 3 or 4 story missions just to up the variety and get you vested into the story, but 1 single mission?? Gaaah.. I just cant even..

2557,4,0.2547,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go","I wanted to like this game. I really did. Blood Money was a classic and the developer promised to bring this game back in line with the classic Blood Money style. So that was enough for me to purchase the Full Experience for 69.99. A rarity for me in this day and age. Most AAA titles don't deserve that amount at launch. So I bought the game and was ready to get a classic Hitman experience. 

Boy was I wrong. 

I don't blame the developers wholly for this, but it's up to them to take a stand when their publishers demand ridiculous features like always online DRM. Take pride in your product and defend the people who will be playing it. 

The game boots you out if connection to the servers drops (which happened frequently at launch) and your progress cannot be carried over to offline mode. 

In addition the game is clearly a console port and is poorly optimized. As of this writing, DirectX12 barely works. No support for 144hz and unless you enable Vsync there will be screen tearing everywhere. 

The game itself was fine when it was working and/or you weren't getting booted out for losing connection. It offered many different approaches to taking down a target and all that other good stuff that made Blood Money so well loved. Graphics are pretty poor and look like something off a PS3. The menus themselves are messy and poorly optimized for a M+KB experience. I have a controller, but I enjoyed playing Blood Money with M+KB. 

That being said, while the core of the game is fine, it is wrapped in hot garbage. Publishers like SE don't deserve 69.99 for this ham fisted crap they push onto PC Gamers. CDProjeckt Red has set a new standard for customer care and LISTENING to the consumer and there is no reason for PC gamers to put up with crap like Hitman with its always online bullshit and shoddy optimization for PC's. 

Also the business model for this game is atrocious. At launch you get two training missions and one actual mission. The rest you have to wait for. Don't support this garbage. 

Thank god for Steam Refund. This further strengthens my resolve to not buy AAA titles at launch."

I've heard some argue that the Paris map is very large and contains a large portion of Paris (i.e. open world), having played this game and been to Paris recently... ; what you really get is one building and it's surrounding gardens with a Paris scenic backdrop, all closed off from access along with most of the garden areas.
If you really want this game, wait for it to go on Christmas sale as the lack of content will lead to a massive reduction in cost by then which the developers deserve for ""Releasing"" a full cost product listed as an open and large world game; which is more like a tech demo and a dated one at that.

Prior to my purchase I had read the information about the game and the plan for it to be an episodic release so this was no suprise to me.  However, the reality of only being able to play on just a hand full of levels for at least a month before a new map is released is just not something that feels right for a game like Hitman.  This current release build feels more like a demo that you pay for.  Coupled with the online server issues that prevent you from accessing material or losing your progress are further proof that this game simply is not ready for release yet.  In the future when the game becomes stable to play with its always online function and there is a moderate enough content to play through I will likely look at revisiting this title.  The potential for a good game is here, but it is not included in this premature release."

The Good
-This is like Hitman Blood Money 2.  Much better then absolution.
-Paris level is HUGE...really well done.
-The level has a fair amount of replayability.

The Bad
-Only one episode/map for now, so be aware of that.  
-Half of my friends were completly unable to play due to poor optimization/graphics issues. Why is there hardware locking?
-Always on connection: Seriously, this is a single player game. There is NO reason it has to be online at all.

To follow up on the always on connection issue: Getting halfway through a mission then disconnecting and losing your progress is a horrible thing.  There's no reason for you to need to be connected to achieve the goals/unlocks. None whatsoever.    As a result, I find myself rushing through missions to get unlocks so that I can try it from different angles...I don't take the time to enjoy the game as much as I'd like to.

TL;DR version:  Hitman Blood Money 2 hampered by unecessary always on issue.

If the technical and always on issues are fixed, I'd recommend it. If you're really itching to play it, get it on sale.  Don't buy the full game, it's not worth it at this point.

I LOVE HITMAN! Just not THIS hitman. However I know I could have, but I don't see that this game is in Beta, or any reason it isn't supposed to be complete. 

Here's the problems:

-Not every one likes Tutorials, but I feel I need to experience every bit of the story I can. A Reboot to Hitman?! With Absolution features?! *Heavy Breathing.* Tried playing through the game 10 minutes in on six seperate occasions. Disconnected from THEIR server. Oh no worries, I'll just finish up and connect later to update my save game. Nope! I am Kicked out of the gameplay and returned to their Menu. Thought I was making a mistake, then I saw all the issues online. That made me mad, but I wasn't going to give up on you Hitman! 

-I'm not really one to care about graphics, but this is 2016. I was surprised by the download of 7 some gb, but now I know why. I ran a benchmark, Hitman Absolution by far has the better graphics, and that game is older then this?! I would have waited for you Hitman, but 60 bucks for this? Come on! Come on guys! I have a Titan X, there's no reason for the game to look like a Xbox 360 game! So much clipping in it that totally broke the atmosphere of the game too. I don't think even Blood Money had so many issues with everything feeling so flat! Also I love Hitman for its design choices, this feels empty and flat as well. Everything feels so 2Dimensional. The execution buttons, The menus. Doesn't feel like a complete game. Especially a $60 game. Disapointing. 

-There are some technical issues, the graphics aren't on point, but what about the game play. A lot of the game play is recycled from other games. Which takes away from a new feeling or a more viceral feeling. The item usage in the game is all I could tell in which they added. I couldn't even make it far enough to use guns though. :-( When I finally got a gun it crashed... Not much I can say on the game play, because I couldn't play it for 10 minutes at a time. For the hour that I tried to make it work though, it felt like the same old Hitman, probably not in a good way though... <.< Sorry Hitman...

-I will follow this game, and hope they finish it, or fix it, or whatever we're calling it these days. However I'm not putting any money down, until they get their shisa together.

2590,0,0.7707,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","The only positive thing is that I feel that there is more ways to breach into places and execute your targets.

However I am too used to Hitman: Absolution. My opinion best Hitman so far, in that game there was a point system which made it awesome! Also in Absolution you could do Point Shooting which gave you a really nice cinematic style of executing your targets. In this game it feels clunky and also I do not feel that I am precise when shooting or aiming with my weapons whereas Absolution felt more accurate and less clunky. For a AAA title the graphics are terrible and it can be often laggy and some stages even though I play most AAA titles in Ultra. Also for Directx 11 users such as myself there is some good news! and that is that you are forced to play on low level of detail and you cannot increase it which makes it look bad. It disgusts me to see that their next game is terrible. waste of money in my opinion!!!

Edit: I forgot to mention that they removed point shooting in this game and that also when you shoot someone in the head with your ICA Pistol, the enemy sometimes just eats that bullet + it is not like Absolution where it would play an imazing cinematic feeling when you shoot someone in the head. Also this game feels like it is unfinished."
2591,0,0.6582,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","So....

I bought the intro pack... Because it would have ""all the paris episode"" plus prologue...
The prologue is just the tutorial with two very simple (<- and I MEAN it) maps and the Paris Episode is just ONE (1, Uno, Um). I played for 3 hours and I finished (done Paris twice).

Now I'm wondering... will the next locations have just one map too? Maybe they are counting the tutorials maps so we can expect 3 maps for locations? So it'll have 5 other locations suming 16 maps plus 2 tutorials... By the complexity of the Paris map I got to say... not enough.

The game mechanics are good enough, while still worse than blood money (especially because of player triggered scripts), it's a very good improvement over absolution, the game tries to rescue the feeling and the gameplay from the blood money merging it with some mechanics from absolution an example is that when you're in disguise just a few people using the same outfit will recognize you, so you have a lot more exploring freedom, while it's still more realistic than blood money. The inventory system comes directly from blood money, where you can have infinite items on it, but larger weapons are in display at all time, preventing you of passing unnoticed while carrying a shotgun and dressed as the cook.

Even with the content that's being promissed for the year I think it'll be a lackbuster, with this amount of content the game should, at least, have some new bonus gameplay features, maybe a small co-op exclusive campaign or some kind experimental assymetrical versus or just a remake of some fan favorites maps from the previous games.

This game, as-is,  is way worse than Ground Zeroes, I have around 10 hours played on that game, the map was huge, there was a lot of approach options, like a dozen of side missions and an actual story, a brand new engine, a pretty decent A.I. and I think it was around the same price as the intro pack.

Anyway, the intro pack is kind of cheap... but the lack of content for a game with ""enter a world of assassination"" as slogan it's simple bizarre, more like ""enter a very, very, very little room of assassination"", if they used the intro pack to lure in more players, it was a missfire...

I'll update the review as more content become available, but right now, the game can't be recommended to anyone."

As it is, this is underwhelming, unoptimised (i have a i-5 4460, 8gigs ram and a gtx750ti and its on lowest settings; a decent computer.) and ultimately, not nearly as fun as i remember. its like blood money and absolution mixed together, yes, but its like playing ""curtains down"" and paying 60 bucks for it. I knew there would be some issues and less that full gameplay, but it really is not what you'd expect on release. 
I expect that in 6 months once the other maps are released it will pay off; till then, save your money folks. to be clear, i bought it for 60 bucks. i regret that now. who knows about the future though.

Why is this a NO review?

There are some problems here which don't really warrent a purchase RIGHT NOW.  However for 15 bucks, if you can't spend that kind of money on a series which you like, you may need to log off of Steam and re-evaluate your life.
For Hitman lovers, it's worth the 15 to at least play through it and see hgow you enjoy the new style of gameplay.  For everyone else I'd wait until the entire game has been released and then is on sale.

Pros:
Decent graphics
Ok voice acting.
Large level
Creative ways to kill target

Cons:
Bad DX12 support
Only 1 real level atm (but we know this going into the game)

I don't even care if you're releasing a second mission at the end of the month, because its only ONE more mission. Whoopdy doo. 2 Missions and a tutorial for $60.

Also the Always Online DRM on a non-multiplayer/non-coop game. Lol.. What's the reason behind that? Can't do challenges/extra stuff while offline anyways. Not like you NEED to connect to the servers to update your online profile or anything like that, cause it don't even matter with no player interaction between eachother. Only thing you need online for is to share contracts, which isn't even fun because of the fact its still the same damn map as the previous 10 player-made contracts.

Never have I been upset with a Hitman game. Absolution was better than this, and I hate games that follow storylines that never change.. Isn't the purpose of releasing a newer title to the series to update/upgrade it, not downgrade? Goes to show which way this one went.

Uninstalled from my PC, I might install it next year when there's actually missions available."
2599,2,0.6018,"online, server, always, save, connection, offline, mode, lose, connect, need","Unfortunately, I can't really recommend this game due to the draconian online vs offline mechanics. There are heavy restrictions placed on you should you choose to play offline (or if you're forced to play offline in the case of a server outage). This, combined with the lack of offline/online save syncing makes for a pretty miserable experience unless you can guarantee you'll always have a consistent, stable connection to the servers - which is not really feasible considering the servers may go down at any time, or for scheduled maintenance.

If they would allow online/offline saves to be synced with each other, I would change this to a ""recommend if you can tolerate the other offline restrictions"". However, I don't see this happening, so I regretfully suggest you pass on this one.

First, the good:
[list]
    [*] Much closer to Hitman Blood Money than it is to Hitman Absolution
    [*] The ""Opportunity"" system is fairly innovative for those who would like some help figuring out ways to complete a given mission - but it can be disabled if you wish to figure everything out on your own.
[/list]

The bad:
[list]
    [*] If you lose connection to the servers for any reason (including issues on the server side), you get dropped from your mission and lose all progress since your last online save or online autosave.
    [*] Online saves do not sync with offline saves. I'm not sure who thought this was a good idea, but nobody else does it this way. This means if you're playing online and later want to play offline (perhaps on a flight, or somewhere else you don't have a reliable internet connection), you cannot load your online save. You'll instead be forced to create a brand new, offline-only save that is in no way linked to your online save. Yeah...
    [*] When playing offline, you are limited to selecting a single starting location and a single Agency drop location for missions, as opposed to the several you get while playing online.
[/list]

Neutral:
[list]
    [*] You're forced to play the tutorial misssion twice. Once as a guided mission where you're forced to complete it a certain way, and again in a freeform style of your choosing.

The eposodic sales methord is intresting. Currently i dont have the funds to pay full price so to play a fair chunk of the game for a small fee is nice. However, im not sure that this will be a benefit in the long run. Comparing this game to somthing like the tell tale games the story is drasticlly missing and feels really disjointed making the satisfaction of finishing a mission not graet enough to make me what to find out what happens next. 
The gamplay is really good though, simply put its a good hitman game. However there is a magor flaw currently and thats the DRM lock of this game. I started playing online played through a fair chunk of the paris mission made a couple saves and was thurally engoying myself. However, i was sudley signed out due to a server error... So i said fine online gamplay features wernt a consern of mine yet. So I tried to load a game in the offline mode and i had no accsess to any of my saves that i had previously done when i was online...... This is bad as i quite often play games on the go with the use of a gaming laptop when im traveling. This is a magor let down for me and in this case the reason i can not recomend this game right now.

Yeah, it is. It's a lot more fun than the last hitman that got released.

Is it worth it?
No, I don't think so. I get that all of it's content is not out yet but that is not the problem.
In order to fully unlock the complete game experience you have to stay online all the time, and the servers you connect up to are shit... I've DCd so many times in just the 3h I have on record and everytime you do you lose all the progress you've made on a mission and have to start over, it can't just switch to offline. In order to complete challanges and unlock new content for replaying missions you also have to stay online.

So do I recomend it?
No, not in this state. The gameplay is fun, a lot better than last game however with its current performance and network problems it's not worth getting. Hopfully it will get better in a near future.

It sadens me to not be able to expect that these problems shouldn't be existing in a AAA title while with Indie titles where this could be expected almost never happens. I feel like we are in a time where the AAA companies just want to milk series of money not caring about the players while indie devs are making games for gamers by gamers.

Hitman Absolution was for me, one of the very best Hitman games there has been. With that in mind, i bought HITMAN (TM) and was very excited to play through an awesome story again with one of my favorite characters. 

HITMAN (TM) is nothing like any other Hitman games. Sure the game mechanichs are the same, but it is buggy, not optimized, lacking in content and somewhat a downgrade from Absolution. 

There is only 3 different levels available at this stage, and remember, this game is almost 50 euro! It feel very unfinished, unpolished and like a BETA version of a game.

The game is overly unoptimized. Between different graphic settings, there is barely any difference for the amount of power required for the PC. I have a mid-high range GTX 960 4GB and I'm not even at mid-high settings, I'm still getting sub 60 fps, dipping to 20 fps maybe even 15 fps. Its too much.

Gameplay wise, I'm not a fan of how flashy they made the game however that is more of a personal preference and I understand it is to entice new players. 

Game-playability and crashes wise, the game doesn't CTD however the always online DRM of the game is absolutely ridiculous to the point where if THE SERVER GOES DOWN, I WILL BE IMMEDIATELY KICKED OUT OF MY GAME.

You are not getting $60 worth of content if you purchase them right now. The ""Upgrade Pack"" is just a season pass, and the full experience is just the intro pack plus the season pass. When you purchase those packs, you're getting the same amount of value as the people who bought the intro pack right now, which is to say two very short 'tutorial' missions and exactly one story mission.

- Bad optimisation: My GTX 970 can't run this at a fluent 60 fps and DX12 causes the game to stutter and occassionally crash.





I had to tinker with the settings to make it run at a stable 45 -60 fps on my GTX 970.
The instinct lowers my fps when I use it (Must be a tradeoff).

I'm pondering whether the episodic release model will work - It forces us to learn each map I guess.

However - The biggest issue is the rubbish online mode.
The servers are unreliable and choppy and when you aren't online.
You also can't access unlocked entry points and gear for the Paris map if you are offline.

I really want this game to work as the developers intended - the base game is fun and has loads of potential but SE need to get their act together and fix their servers and optimise the game before Agent 47 gets to Sapienza.

Memories from Blood Money and past Hitman games.  Absolution wasn´t really my kind of game and I prefer the classic mechanics of Hitman as well. Now this game brings it back. 

HITMAN plays to the time where Agent 47 ( Hitman ) was devoloped and started to operate. In the game you are starting with a training mission on a Yacht where you have to eliminate a target without being seen or killed. Silence, tactical operation like pre-planing, gathering informations about the enemy etc, etc is strongly recommended to go for that. The game isn´t story rich so if you want to have a proper story line than you play the wrong game.

The game will be splitted in episodes over the year. To be honest.... it wont make the game better. It´s rather damaging the game and the feel of gameplay. Once you finished the first episode than you have to wait for such a long time to get the next episode. I would like it more to have a full Hitman game. 

Technical wise the game doesnt run that properly at the moment. Especially when I was on the Yacht mission my FPS count droped to 30 FPS. Also the loading screen takes a while and it can reduce the fun. 

My current specs :
GTX 670
Intel Core i7 3770K 3rd generation 3,4 GhZ
16 GB DDR3 RAM
2 SSDs .

The game is being played on my 250 gb ssd and it still has huge frame drops from time to time. 

The game is not bad but it´s also not super good currently. The episode splitting... the Frame drops... thats a no go for me and it shouldn´t be in a Hitman game. I really hope NVIDIA and AMD will bring driver updates and the Developers will also do something there.

If all of this is fixed than I can recommend this game for the HITMAN fans out there.

Otherwise I would say... wait for a sale if you want to go for it or wait until all epsiodes are released.

Why do you need a mix of gamepad and MS/KB, just make it one or the other. If you select MS/KB the just show that option. The game do not give you a lot of freedom, if you pull you gun, then you can't holster it again. The (I) for inventory do not work, if you don't carry anything please just show an empty inventory.

So really playing a mission is just going through each sequence of pre-conceived ways of killing your target. That's not really ""open play"", is it?

---
Original review: 

So at the end of the day, no matter how you spin the ""episodic content"", this game has 1 mission. You buy the ""full experience"", it'll keep you busy for a day while you play the single story mission available to you.

I'm not bothered by the artwork in the game, it's not the spirit of Hitman, but the DX12 mode is buggy and I needed to use DX11 mode (which has pretty poor performance). 

I also feel a little cheated that although the description does explain the episodic content, I wasn't expecting to put out full price to abruptly be told I need to wait another month before I can play level 2.

But other than that, great game."

2643,0,0.4087,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","As a massive Hitman fan this is disappointing so far, while the game is beautiful the core functionality fails. Hitman traditionally is a single player experience and more recently (in Hitman: Absolution) has had online elements tacked on, to give you a sense of lots of content.

I'm sad to say online DRM ruins this experience (when doesn't it), I was kicked out of my game because the connection failed and to continue from a previous save you must reconnect. (Sucks when you have poor internet or lots of people using your bandwidth.)

Apparently if you play offline then you will have an offline save. Challenges are also disabled in offline mode, so you wont be able to level 47 up to buy/unlock new weapons or tech to reply the levels in new ways (so much for replayability) 

I wish I hadn't bought this via GMG just so I could refund it because I don't support this level of locked in online only bull, at least in a single player game.

Also what's going to happen when the servers shut down in 5 years time, there is a challenge in the game to eliminate 5 exclusive targets. 

Exclusive targets are IO's (only online) small offering to keep you enticed because there isn't a lot to do and we don't know yet how big or how many levels there will be. We also don't know if the unlock benefits from completing them will be unlockable any other way it would be scummy if you can't.

(They have said no micro transactions but I bet the costumes/weapons from these exclusive targets will be up for a price)


I would hold off buying this at least till IO or Square Enix change their narrative or change the game regarding the online only elements.

Heres hoping the mod scene can turn this around and stop this, I payed for a single player experience not a tacky online mess but I doubt it because of Denuvo and server checks.


Also in playing the game some more I've found the ""replayability"" laughable most of the challenges and assassination only vary by a small amount. So you end up replaying multiple times using the exactly the same method but using a gun instead of fiber wire.

I've resorted to having a good save start point that already has the masterkey a few tools fireworks remote etc, just to be able to speed through the challenges and assassinations. Because I don't find most of them fun, contracts mode definitely needs more variety. 

If every level is like this just two target per level then this will be disappointing."

2671,0,0.8521,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Wait for a sale! (also, Hitman 2 has all of these levels)

It's more like James Bond. Music is out of place and dark theme is  absent, also story is meh. Mechanics are decent(except the X-ray vision) but the game is only decent on a professional difficulty or above, anything below that is spoon fed and due to the sandbox nature you will be visiting the same locations again and again, so recon/adaptation burns out pretty quick.

Hitman cn47 / SA / contracts / blood money define the DNA of this series in three major ways: a) Dark theme b) Music c) Mechanics. Also the first two games were not easy at all to complete on a full stealth approach because of some unpredictable AI RNG. The NEW hitman games after 2016 nails the mechanics part of the Hitman DNA with good improvements (remember the older game's clunky and complex controls) but completely misses out on theme and music (that is partly the reason why it feels like James Bond). 

The new Hitman has better graphics, an engine able to handle large and dense environments, however this might not always work in the favour. Older Hitman games have a very few ways to kill the target but the new Hitman has too many ways to kill the target and you can almost turn the game into a circus show for few hours! but not everyone wants that. There are also too many usable objects around the map compared to older Hitman games (which have a very few); which brings us to difficulty of the game, combine dense environments with too many interactive objects and many ways to get in and kill target and you have a game that becomes less difficult in assassination and more of a circus clown show.
In hindsight, instead of focusing on highly dense environments and adding tons of new clown ways to kill a target, they should make more medium sized maps with a new mission. In fact, they should work on making more medium density maps rather making only a few highly dense maps with too many ways to kill.

Some assisting mechanics shorten the game and fun like X-ray vision and guided tracking, that's why you should turn it off. 

I've been a Hitman fan since early 2000s when it  came out for the first time, I remember me and my friend discovered it as a demo in a tech magazine's DVD but we were like 8 at that time and failed to complete the demo mission without messing up stuff every time xD."

For a 2016 Triple A title I was very sad, esp as I love the Hitman series, and whilst it does add back in that versatility in how you kill, also the uniforms work pretty neatly, in that certain guards / people are only knowledgeable of certain uniforms (usually their own), unlike that crappy instinct shit from Absolution. There are alotta other points to make that are hard to really get across without having you play it yourself. But in general, graphics/networking aside, the gameplay feels unbelivably unpolished and unfinished in it's current state, asif you were playing an a beta/alpha.

2695,0,0.5445,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","[h1] For those who concern - This is my first and very honest review.[/h1]

[h1]About me:[/h1]
[spoiler]I'm a fan of Hitman series. In fact hitman is one of the few game i paid real money to play it.
I played Hitman: Codename 47, Silent Assassin, Contracts, Blood Money, Aboslution and even Hitman GO
They said Hitman Contracts was bad but i still try to enjoy it because i love that bald and mean looking guy
I mention this so you guys could know how love i really put for the hitman series. 
I was overjoy when heard that Hitman release and eager to play it and i regret my decision immediately[/spoiler]

[h1]About the game:[/h1]
Technically there are 4 levels.
-Turtorial - You learn how to play the game
-Replay turtorial - with diffirent strategies *such freedom* *much wow*
-Turtorial: Final test - Small map but there is one fun method to kill the target
-Paris - The one you see a lot on youtube. Large map

[h1]Things you expected when you paid for full experience:[/h1]
-A huge inventory of weapon like Hitman: Blood Money - Not gonna happen
**The game only let you choose 2 gears, 1 weapon and 1 costume before doing the mission, and the only mission you're allow to do that is Paris.
-A full game - You only have 4 levels like i mentioned. *Oopps*
-A details map about intersting point to discovery, a sandbox like they said - Nope, the map contains only 2 things: The targets and the staircase. =>> The map was not helpful
-Too easy to finish missions.
-Characters lip not fit with the voice
-Graphic is not improving a lot since the absolution.
-You paid 60$ but you get 15$, suck to be you... Oh wait... Those people bought Intro pack can play the game first but you can't until they full release. -- Sucker
-Elusive mode is *Not Available*
[i]-What is the duck is use for? Maybe i have to sitting duck wait for them to make a fully fuction game [/i] *The duck is available when you select gears*

The issue i got:
-Loading Paris for the first time and there was a bug made all characters hanging, then slowly turning to cinematic
-Planted a bomb but there was no remote and the bomb turn into a mine
-Some people concern about the 24/24 connect. I don't find that a problem but still i still name it here
but what is 24/24 connect is for by the way? 

My conclusion about the game:
I really dissapointed about this game and also the first time i tried the refund button. I could say that this is somekind of fraud because when i purchased full experience, meant i want to play a full game, not just an intro pack. Everything i read when they intro Hitman was a lie and i cannot accpect it. I bought it because the hitman, bought it before it release to have it White suit. But then after playing the game, those things are not important anymore

Don't buy it, because if you buy it you're support them to make these kind of games in the future. You don't want that right? Your money is your tear and blood.

I thought that with this ""episodic"" crap they would have optimezed the game really well, as they had more time to work on the game mechanics and performance, since they only release 1 map + training, but I thought wrong.

********** OLD REVIEW BELOW **********

! I still stand by every word of it for that time, it was pretty horrible. 

I understand that you guys are running an experiment here but I don't like it. Please don't do this kind of release for a Hitman game ever again.

First of all, ""FULL EXPERIENCE"" means 2 training levels and 2 full levels ATM. That is it and I am not exaggerating or kidding. You get exactly 2 story levels which are ""Paris"" and ""Sapienza"". As soon as you're finished with it that's it. The end of the game's story until you get the next (not the rest of the game but the next ONE) level in May (hopefully), then the next one in June and so on. Cool setup for a Hitman game, right? And there are only 6 levels in total. That is less than any other Hitman game ever. Awesome, right?

I like to complete my games' story in full and only then replay them hunting for achivements and nailing challenges. And only after that do I usually try any online features. That's how I played Absolution and it's a great game. But this here crap lasts a couple of hours if you play it that way and then all you got is either replaying the only full scale level or playing the online features that will drop you out if you disconnect from the server for whatever reason. Mostly the disconnect problem is not on the player's side (do I hear Uplay? yeah, exactly like that junk). Discovering all this BS took me more than 2 hours so now I can't get a refund. No matter how elaborate the description for the refund request the answer is alays the same: uuuuh, you got more than 2 hours so go f*ck yourself and shove that crap of a game up your azz. Great.

***

With some fps drops on Geforce experience recommended setting (minus 1 point in shadows setting) this godawful game heats my 980Ti up to 80 degrees with the coolers spinning like crazy at 2000+ rpm and there is nothing on the screen that should cause that. What the hell are dudes with old GPUs gonna do? Watch a f*ckin slideshow?

But that's not what pisses me off. What actually made me furious is the intro to the apparently only mission in the game that says ""Crimean separatists blew up a nuclear plant near Odessa"". WHAT THE F*CK, MAN?! We now have biased political BS in modern videogames? I'll turn on the TV if I want to hear political bigotry, I don't need it when I'm resting.

F*ck the creators of this game, f*ck the publisher, f*ck episodic content in a Hitman game and f*ck politics in games! I want my money back!

***

Unfortunately I didn't really check the details and didn't know it was going to be episodical with huge time gaps between episodes as it never happened to a Hitman game before. If I knew that I'd buy it like I buy my telltale games - when it's fully done. But that's entirely my problem.

But a game with new bugs every month, features not working (elusive target) and only 2 levels fully done is early access game to me."

Bought this one right when it first came out, but found a lot of issues straight away. The game is NOT ready for release.

I have a 16GB PC with a quad core processor and with the lowest resolution options it is slow and impossible to play properly.

Body dragging does not work (It's not just me because I searched ""hitman can't drag body"" in google and found out that other peope are having the same issue)

2708,4,0.4468,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go","This is probably the pinacle of bad ideas in the gaming industry.
I loved Blood Money and enjoyed Absolution but I cannot support a game that releases, episodic or not, as $60 with so little content.
I am very hesitent to buy 'early-access' games on Steam these days as many of the developers have decided to abandon their titles before completion as the game's sales have already peaked.
This HITMAN feels as though a AAA game studio saw the work vs reward of many early-access games and decided they should try it as well.
Basically, you buy the game and must trust that the developer will not only finish it, but finish it in a satisfying manner. What prevents the studio from not finishing this series? What prevents them from phoning in the rest of the episodes?

While I knew of the 'episodes' when I purchased the $60 version I still think the game borders into some grey areas of ethics. The videos shown above show a much more finished product which many, like myself, thought would be a part of the first episode.

75% of the content in the first episode is dull and uninspiring anyway. The fashion show mission called Showstopper is much nicer but still felt unentertaining to me. I swore I heard the words 'open world' somewhere in marketting before this came out and the levels feel very small to me. Maybe the square footage of the Showstopper is larger than some, but it felt clostrophic. I think of a large spanning room where the ceilings are only 4ft high.

Lastly, while I'm sure some enjoy it, I can't help but feel that the completionist mindset of the game is lazy. Many things within the game, all replays of the same missions mind you, are locked unless you complete challenges. These challenges are things like ""Kill this person wearing this uniform in this fashion"". I feel like they're trying to capture the essense of Blood Money but instead of giving the freedom of Blood Money they force the player. Do this Agent 47. Ok. Now do this.
I'm not sure if I can explain it better than that, but I had no interest in listening to the game.

I just cannot approve of this new direction the franchise is taking. I have no interest in it. I think it's dangerous to customers as well. It feels like a family member asking for money. That they'll pay you back later. In an undefined time frame. With money they're betting on making. From the money they borrowed from you.

No uncle 47- please stop.

EDIT: On a positive note, I received a refund from Steam for this game. I'm pleasantly surprised they refunded me but felt it was worth mentioning. It was not only refunded in full, but the very next day. Thumbs up to Steam."

WAY too short. They should have put in more missions from the start.
Smells like an Early Access - Maybe they're low on cash in IO? :)

My recommendations would NO to the price of the game. But Yes to Hitman in general... I like the missions, they're okay a little too quick to complete (Intro), but when you get your first (and apparently ONLY!) assignment in Paris, it get's a lot harder. 

So DON'T spend the money on the ""Full Experience"" - Unless you want a Full Experience on getting fucked on ;)

2714,0,0.3073,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","Is what little of the early access game here better then Absolution gameplay wise? yes, the costume mechanic is a lot better then Absolutions where now only a select few people like the bosses of the proffesion can see theough the disguise so a middle ground between Absolution and older Hitman games that makes sense.  But that is about as far as I can say good things for the game in its early access state, now for the bad.

Right now there is only 3 levels, 2 training levels and then Paris, the two training missions are fairly small maps but still a bit better design the Absolutions maps. The Paris map however is a fairly good sized map unlike the corridor maps of Absolution.

Framerate on a fairly decent PC even with all settings turned down low is awful, like 16-30 FPS awful and I can play games like Witcher 3 and Just Cause 3 and Fallout 4 all on ultra settings getting over 60FPS, poorly optimized, maybe a NVidia driver update in the next few days will help, but right now it is a cringe worthy framerate.  And secondly always online needed to do anything in the game, I personally have not disconnected from the servers, but there are people who have had connection issues and this always online for a game people play mostly single player is the same type of crap of Sim City reboot being always online, no need, and hopefully Squenix learns something soon and does the same thing EA learned with Sim City and allows people to play offline.

If the framerate gets fixed, the always online gets pulled, and if the Paris map shows promise then I will change this to a possitive review, but those two major issues are a no sale no reccomend for any PC gamer, maybe the console version doesn't require always online, but still the framerate there would be nearly unplayable as well so all I can say is wait a hope they learn quickly that this is not acceptable on PC.

Update: With using Dx11 (but still with most settings on low) as a pose to Dx12 the framerate is acceptable, but still I would either wait for a driver update to fix the issues or something because the game shouldn't need to be on such low settings to run well.

All in all, if the future maps are like Paris of being a bit more open and a bit larger, my biggest hold up for reccomending is the always online, that needs to be Sim Citied and the publisher/developer needs to revert that idea for me to change to a reccomended sale.

But all in all if the always online gets pulled Hitman is much closer to the originals then Absolution was, infact in many ways I feel like it could compete with Blood Money if it wheren't for the always online. So if you like the Hitman series and don't mind that unless the publisher changes their minds about the way the game in handled that when the publisher feels they are not making enough money to keep the servers up that the game you bought will become unplayable then this is a good addition to the Hitman series (given the remaining 5 maps keep pace with Paris), but until that online issue gets changed I can not personally reccomend it."

- Poor Graphic.

  - gain scores & XP(mastery)
  - beat in-game challenges
  - choose different spawn locations other than the two offline ones
- AI

Yet another bad console port.  It is Batman AK all over again.

i7-4770k, GTX 980TI, 16gb ram, Windows 10x64

First of all this game is completely unplayable for me currently as it often and randomly locks up.  I haven't not been able to solve it.

Performance:
Performance isn't great but not horrible when it comes to FPS but there is a lot more to it than that which I will get to in a minute.
DirectX 12, MAX all settings, 5k resolution - Average 20FPS
DirectX 12, MIN all settings, 2k resolution - Average 100FPS
DirectX 11, MIN all settings, 2k resolution - 60FPS locked.

Oddly in DX 11 mode this game seems to have a 60FPS cap.  How disgusting.  This cap does not appear to be present in DX 12 mode.

While framerate is decent, the game has serious asset streaming issues and appears to deal with it in the typical console way.  Serious asset popping incluing textures, shadows, and even entire actors just popping into place.  There is also a weird cloth sim issue where the closer you get to say a woman in a dress, the more refined the cloth simulation becomes.  The game has a VERY small distance in which it switches to the set quality level.

Graphical difference between MAX settings and 20fps and MIN settings and 100fps is very subtle!  I mean reall,y it is different but not by a whole lot.  Honestly it looks last gen either way.  I almost feel like the screenschots and marketing shots are all fake because the game looks nothing like them even on maximum settings.  Do yourself a favor and just play on min."

I mean i was expecting the game to be broke on release like most games that are ported. I think anyone here who did expect this game to work day 1 is a god damm fool. i expected to run into things like bugs fps drops for no reason, AI to be utterly screwed.  

Hoever, I did not expect  it to take me like 2 hours to actually get it running on my machine, I  mean i was stuck at the launcher, eventually after playing around with settings uninstalling drivers and re installing them i managed to get past the launcher. I get to begin to play a game i have waited so long for. Get dropped off at the very first scene get to walk as 47 starts to feel good.......

Get past the cut scene then here comes the loading screen to what must be the first mission. I start to get excited suddenly loading bar stuck at 75%...It just does not want to move at all, decide it may have just crashed so reload have a look around the title screen and find the first mission and start it up, same thing 75% so i leave it there and go grab some food only to come back and see its still there. Check in task manager see the game is using 0% of my cpu. Tried restarting my machine over and over and same results.

Is this another port where i cant play untill a few months like Dead Rising 3 and then by the time the game actually works its on sale and the only thing that they will see at 75% is the amount off the sale price. 

This gets old really quick. Untill its fixed i think this will not be recommended to anyone unless you are playing it on console.

Ashamed for this so called 'PC Master Race'"

2745,0,0.4729,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","What is going on with the gaming industry lately? Im am so disappointed. This kind of crap has happened on several game released lately.

As far as the game play, yes i enjoy it, its Hitman. If you are a Hitman fan then you will like it. Its along the lines of Blood Money, not that linear crap they pushed out last time. From what ive seen game play was solid except one issue i found. Open doors are invisible to the AI. Meaning I opened a door, entered  a room and stood behind the door. A guard walked into the hallway that i just came from. I could not see him, the door was between us. But he still saw me and shot me through the door. I never saw him but died anyways.

Other then that the rest of the game play was good. They added more complexity to the AI comments and behaviors. One example i liked was if you ""accidentally"" walked into an off limits area. In past games you would be automatically considered hostile and the guards would start shooting at you. In this Hitman they act like real people, they will tell you that you are not allowed in that area, they will escort you back outside of the area where you came from, then go about their business. They only get hostile if you refuse to comply.

Ive seen alot of review complain about graphics, or settings grayed out, low FPS, etc. I did not experience any of those problems. I could play on high/ultra settings (1920 x 1080), none of the settings where disabled, graphics were smooth, not one complaint. My video card is Nvidia GeForce GTX 780 Ti (12gig).

Alot of people also complain about the constant internet connection. Yes, i also agree that is crap and i had a problem with it. In the middle of playing their server went down, so i got kicked from my level back to the menu. My internet was online it was just the Hitman server that was offline. The game allowed me to switch to offline mode to play. But in offline mode it would not load the game save which was saved in online mode. I just stayed in offline mode, started the mission over from the beginning, and F their online mode.

Now for the really sucky part... If you read the fine print, they say that they are only releasing the game with the Paris content then plan to release more content 6 more times through out the year. The Paris content is literally *ONE* mission on one small map of a house. Yes its a big house, but still one location all the same. Really? I waited two years for this game to come out and paid $60 just to end up with one house and one mission??? I am not counting the two very small tutorial training maps you play first before unlocking the *ONE* mission. If you count those then you have three whole missions for $60. With the release of content 6 more times are those also going to be solo missions? So i have to wait a year just to get one complete game of a whooping 7 missions ?!?!?!?!?!? Oh' boy what a deal, not.

In a nut shell, yes it's a fun game.
Yes, Hitman fans will enjoy how they went back to their roots of being an open world/map with multiple solutions.
Thank you devs for allowing me to skip cut scenes. I hate it when games force you to watch their entire blah blah.
However i feel that the devs took the lazy approach releasing a game with only *ONE* mission. I feel very cheated compared to the past Hitman games.

DO NOT SURRENDER AND AVOID THIS TITLE FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS.
I know there will be lots of haters out there now telling me that the graphics are great and the concept is the best ever and it promises to be the crowning jewel in the franchise. This all may be true, but at the moment it's just promises.
As I write this I am looking at the howls of frustration on the forums and blogs about the DRM and the servers being down on release day, so their first promise of being able to play a snippet of the game on release day(choose your own definition), has already been broken.
You see here is the awful truth. If I or anyone else knew that it was a year till they finished the game, I wouldn’t have pre-ordered it this early. I would have been excited and eagerly awaited the release, but I wouldn’t have thrown down my hard earned. I’m sure no one else would have either. I mean it could be worse, at the moment we only have a single mission we can’t play until the servers get fixed. If the game was complete we would have more missions we couldn’t play until the server gets fixed. (What can I say I’m a glass half full kind of guy.)

Alright, the HITMAN beta is out!  A little buggy, and I would've expected the series to evolve at least a bit from its original formula (it doesn't), but it's a beta, and it's FAR better than Absolution. (8/10)

March 11, 2016
WTF?!  I paid $60 for this?!  This is exactly what everyone else got to experience in the beta, plus one more level.  And it can't connect to the server?!  Am I being punked?!  Agent 47 needs to track down the people responsible for this!  (4/10)

5:24am, March 12, 2016
I asked for a refund today.  (10/10)

7:18am, March 12, 2016
Refund denied :(  So basically I paid $60 for a game that I've played for 87 minutes.  Yeah, yeah, more content will be released later.  But I didn't pay for later, I paid for now (BEFORE IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE GAME WOULD BE EPISODIC).  Yeah, sure, I can go and replay that ONE level for a month to figure out all the neat ways to complete the challenges, but if I can't connect online, WTF good does that do me?!  How about they take my money in f*cking episodes?!  F*ck this game, f*ck IO, f*ck Square Enix, and f*ck Valve!  (2/10)

7:12pm, March 12, 2016
So I finally got my refund.  Had to refund it to my steam wallet, rather than back to my bank.  Whatever.  I can now hold onto the money until this POS is done and deeply discounted, with enough to buy something better to fill my time.  Great exercise in how to get a refund. (98.6/10)

To top it off, this isn't a complete game. The single player experiance is spread across multiple ""episides"" which will be released over time. So even if you COULD play it (which you can't), you have two main missions play. They basically shipped a mostly multiplayer-only game and are adding most of the missions over time as DLC.

I can only write a first impression, since I only finished the tutorial and just started the Paris level.   Let me start to say that I am a big Hitman fan and played and finished all games on purist level with silent assasin status.  So I was really looking forward to play this one.   Well, let me tell you......So far I am really disappointed. 

In the short period I played, this is what I noticed:

Technical stuff:
-  Playing on DX12 mode causes freezes.  Playing on DX11 works fine.
- I could not start the game without controller.   Keyboard/mouse did not work properly.  In menu it only showed the controller buttons, not keyboard buttons , i.e.:  ""press A to continue' instead of 'press enter to continue'. After plugging in a controller the problem was instantly solved. Also keyboard/mouse work fine now. 
- In Tutorial graphics seemed static: people barely moving, not changing position, fabrics not moving (example:the flag on the ship and the curtains around the scene)

About AI:
- AI sucks to a level it almost made me cry.
-  No need to sneak, i can just walk behind the enemy in a room that was clearly not meant for people to be in : running arround, bumping the target even, still did not get me noted by the 2 other people int he room  They only noted me when i stood right in front of them.
- After being caught, i could still kill the target and slowly wander off.  Took the guards ages to respond.....even if caught red handed. I could have killed everyone in the meantime, had a drink at the bar, have swim and slowly leave the scene.
- To make matters worse, while being shot at, i fled into a dressing room with only 1 exit. Guards did not even come after me, but aimed at me through the wall from outside the room. When eventually a guard did come in to check, he did not even check the only closet there!  Indeed, the one I was hiding in.  They knew i was there. There was no way out....the other guards still stood outside aiming at me through the wall.  Guard inside mentionned I was gone. 
- At another moment I killed a guy while he was alone in a bathroom. No witnesses at all; no one close by. Yet the guards instantly knew they had to look for a bald guy dressed at as waiter...WTF! 
- Suddenly I saw on the map  that guards moved to my location.  They said they found the body, but I was still alone on the bathroom with that body with the door closed. No way they could have seen it. Anyway.... I went out of the window and hid outside on the ledge. Guess what... the guards knew exactly where I was (through the walls) and started shooting me (also through the wall).  So I quickly moved aside, passing a window of the next door room, before the guards arrived there. And suprisingly... still they knew exactly where to look.

I can't believe this is the Hitman from the series I love.   I wondered if i was playing on super easy mode or something, but did not find an option to change the level. Only option was to turn of pointers.


Of course there are also positives to mention:
- Textures look awesome
-Atmosphere is great
- Voice overs are great
- The world is screaming to be explored and conversations begged to be listened to.
-  Really great audio 
- It's Hitman


Fix the AI quick please! Because you can not tell me this is meant to be! 

At this point I really can not recommend the game for diehard Hitman lovers.  I I hope they patch soon and put some intelligence in those NPC.  Since I did not get it through Steam  I can't get a refund.  Else I probably would untill this is fixed.

They though PC gamers can handle low framerates, maybe it's better for them. They stopped releasing optimized games, and keep making our eyes hurt. Most known examples are Watch_Dogs, Batman: Arkham Knight, Assassins Creed: Unity...

[h1]I'm Not A Pre-Order Guy[/h1]
My first pre-order is Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain, because it gives another free copy of Ground Zeroes. I was happy at the end, because they release the game very fine. Game was so smooth, so i can't play any other game for a while after Phantom Pain. My second was Naruto Shippuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 just for character bonus. I did not except a lot from it, it's classic NSUNS game with tag team system. That game gave me what i except, also it was cheap. Even if fails, i won't lose too much. I was know the stakes. But in the end, that pre-order was fine. After that, i just pre-ordered Street Fighter V for beta. Also i got very badass Chun-Li costume too. I was not sad after full release. It has a little bit connection issues, not too much. The only one problem about it, it has not punishment system for ragequiters and it's fixed now. So, that pre-order was not a bad idea.

Suddenly i changed my mind. After those years, i can pre-order games without fear. Then i saw Hitman's pre-order deal. That suit... That suit was my childhood. I spent lots of hours on Blood Money when i was 9. After all, Hitman Franchise one of the my favorite franchise. I trusted Square Enix after Absolution, back in the day i bought it on day one. I still play Absolution sometimes. That game is not bad like community says. Back in the topic, after saw that suit i gave a shot about it. Then I play HITMAN Beta and it was not bad at all. The game runs about 50-60 at normal, gets a lil bit stutters if NPC's are lot. I was not feel bad for that pre-order money until now.

I'm okay with episodic chapter plan. The problem is i can't even test DX12, it just give white lights on black patterns. (Which is fixed with 16.3 driver, the one not works with autoupdate somehow i done it manually, twice. Because it corrupts 3-4 times, so i used DDU to make it clean. Even it fixed the game crashes a lot in DX12, which is i've not know why it happens.) In DX11 i get 30-40fps, sometimes i can see 10fps too. 10FPS with a effin $500 graphics card. TEN EFFIN FRAME PER SECOND. So, after this experience i decided pre-ordering games are taking a huge d in your mouth, just like Eric Cartman says. I was not waiting this shit from you Square Enix...

I'm not recommend this game, it's runs too bad, maybe a few patches can fix it. I'm double checking my gpu drivers, maybe they can fix it i dunno.

[h1]Lets Pretend Like Optimization Is Not Bad[/h1]
Like i've said it before, episodic games are fine to me. I'm not digging around HITMAN too much, those fps problems are broking my soul and damaging my eyes. Even it has one mission on day one, gameplay was good. I mean, there is lots of opportunities, disguises, killstyles... Map is big, like was in Blood Money. It's pretty direct sequel to Blood Money, it's fine. Also it has some elements from Absolution like Instict with a better version. I'm in love with game even i play 5 hours (and 5 hours are nuff for a first episode), I'll play more and planning to give more info about it.

Well, forgot the mention it the human shield and point shooting are removed. I have wanted the use them again, because sometimes i want to play movie-style (pew pew pew), but unfortunately they removed instict bar which is used to be for point shooting. I hope human-shield will be back, but it's not necessary. Also, if it's direct sequel to Blood Money if we consider play-style, where is the god-damn sniper cases? Smuggling item will helping kinda, but i want to use that case. Another thing to mention, animations kinda dummy. Beta was more good about animations like walk, using wire, running and climbing."

2815,0,0.548,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","this game strove to be  a hybrid of bloodmoney and absolution, touted as the best of both worlds, but due to io's loss of insight and the exigencies of modern game industry i'm sure, they simply made another absolution with bigger levels. there is no return to the roots they kept hyping before release. suitcase interaction, holstering animation, procedural fiberwiring animations, and multifarious little details, ie the things which fans have been agitating for since their disappearance from absolution, have been even further streamlined and dumbed down for the casual masses. teleporting objects and instantaneous animations are a constant sight in this game.

perhaps the biggest deal breaker is the completely dull and scripted nature of the characters in this game. targets and important characters will remain stationary until you activate them by moving in close proximity. you can spend the entire game hiding 20 feet away from one of these important characters, and unless you advance 5 feet, or however large the event trigger radius is, he will remain there indefinitely and stationary. the autonomous ai from bloodmoney has been replaced by linear scripts that belong in a call of duty game.

don't be fooled, the original development team has essentially moved on. these current io developers are hopeless and completely lack any understanding of why certain hitman features were great, instead they made a simulacrum of those features and failed to combined them into a working game. also, the performance is god awful. this is the only game in my library that dips below 60 fps. and worst of all, at low/medium setting, this game looks like it was made in 2008, yet the average fps is still hovering around 20-30. unacceptable and atrocious."

I'm not really interested in Contracts as I always prefer playing Story missions (in all games). The gameplay would be perfect if I can actually get 60+ fps at least but sadly the game is horribly optimized and it's the only game running at low settings on my msi ge70! I play all recent games at least on medium settings but this game is not FPS friendly at all! I hope Square Enix looks into this huge issue and make the fans happy.

I have played every Hitman game since the first, yes I am that old and crusty. I was so excited about Hitman Absolution I looked pass or dare I say Blindfolded my ass to help me ignore its shortcummings. The Hitman games have become a mindless series. Yes, the graphics are great, the environemnts are awesome and the dialogue is superb. However, the gameplay reminds of the old 8bit and bit days of gaming where you had to play the level several times to memorize what or how the AI would behave. My good friend since High-Schoool has worked at ""IO"" / Square Enix or whatever they call themselves for about  odd years. He has happily worked on more than one Hitman game in the past and always had great things to say. However, in the last  3 to 4 year or so it has not been that way. Jeff has always said very little about Hitman Absolution and the recent Hitman now series ""For Profit"". He left IO interactive 6/15 and was asked to reconsider through several emails and meatings with upper management. As he worded it, the series has become a mindless game where the ""AI"" has predertimned paths and behaviors in place regardless as to how you play the level or navigate it. So, no matter how well you plan your attack on the level, you will most likely have to ""Redo"" it once you learn the AI paths and behaviors. I feel like its 1999 again.

In the years leading up to this game I dreamed of an experience as wonderful as Blood Money, the formula was so perfect and expectations were high that the new Hitman game would deliver on what the fans wanted. Now while Absolution isn't the best as far as a Hitman title goes, at least it can be classified as a finished product. Hitman uhh......HITMAN is the newest entry in IO interactives most recognizable franchises, and it's broken. While I can't speak for all of the optimization, and performance problems of everyone allow me to share my experience. On booting up the game I put my settings to medium level of detail, high textures, medium shading and fxaa antilialising. As soon as the first training mission started, I get graphical glitches with the lighting. Shadows from light sources casting through walls, flickering constantly completely taking me out of the game. Other than that the game ran fine with my hardware which is an AMD 79503gb, 8gb ddr3 ram, and an intel i7 4770k proccessor. Upon turning the shadows on low the flickering stopped for the most part and i continued. Then onto the actual paid demo, I mean first entry in this episodic series. Everything was working in it's favor it felt great, looked great and reminded me of blood money times a 100. Then halfway through the mansion after running smoothly for 20 minutes it starts to stutter uncontrollabley, rendering the game unplayable. I was having such a good time too, the richness of the level and sheer number of ways I could accomplish my task is amazing. I love the disguise macanic and they've found a way to make it work in a sensible way. instead of being free to go wherever as certain disguises or needing instinct certain NPCs of that group youre dressed as may notice you, so a big strategy is finding the most unique disguise with the most access. All of the mechanics could have been so sweet, it's all there. I sincerely hope the developers address all performance issues and release the quality we Hitman fans have been hyped for."

I purchased the intro pack of this game basically so that i could get access to the initial beta to see if the gamewould be any good.   I had my reservations after IO had only supplied the first 3 small tutorial missions as a whole Beta experience ""but whatever right?"".

Now that the full game has been released i have to say that unfortunately, my reservations have been realized.  Ok yes I've only purchased the Intro Pack (whichs gives you access to all current content on release day), but where is the game?  I am a massive fan of the Agent 47 franchise, and ave previously purchased all of the game on both console and PC platforms (Don't judge me too harshly for the consoles, I was young!)  this game has a tutorial comprised of 3 missions and one main mission in Paris. 

So it seems that IO believe that a game is worth even the intro level price of £10.99 for one mission and 2 targets.  Id have happily paid the £39.99 if i hadn;t read it would only allow acces to up to 4 main missions.  whats happened to the game like silent assassin where we had 10+ missions and an armoury.. or contracts where we had much the same for the same price level.

Unfortunetly for me this game seems like yet another one of the embarrassing cashcows that studios are releasing today.  this is going to hurt the franchise more than help it out.

On a positive not,  in my experience the game does run well, its not too clunky and the levels seem fairly well thought out.  but i have yet to experience more than one mission, so who know how much potential the game actually has.

I am sorry IO, but for me this is a fail more so because you seem to be screwing your fanbase than for the actual game.  it just wasn't what I personally expected a studio of this size to bring to the table at all."

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

It feels good. Controlling 47 is once again comfortable, precise and empowering. IO had the decency to allow for all the in-game assistances to be deactivated (I did keep the icons indicating which enemies can be suspicious). Overall, there are tons of good ideas, and an undeniable attention to detail. You feel free to explore and tackle the objectives how you see fit. By now most people might already know what big changes have been made since Absolution, like the revamped disguise system and the sandbox-ish open levels, so I won't say anything about this. These latter had been promised, they're here, there's nothing to complain about.

I'll seize the opportunity to briefly mention the story: while we are just given a little glimpse at it, it does seem well-crafted and interesting. The prologue/tutorial takes place at the beginning of 47's career, when he first joined the ICA. The Paris level - and the rest of the game after that - takes place a few years after Hitman Absolution (without direct link to said episode, like a new start, a clean slate, in order for us to better appreciate the experience of playing as 47 when he does what he does best).

Each destination will have its own ambience and each target, his background story. An overarching story ties it all together, and the balance is perfect : it is there, it is interesting, and it manages not to feel too intrusive.

Nevertheless, some design choices do manage to ruin the fun for me : the game requires you to be online. Should you be disconnected from the servers, the game will quit and you won't be allowed to load your saves. A distinction is being made between online and offline saves. This is unacceptable.

The game will slow down for no reason after shooting someone is the head, and so far this unadequate, inelegant ""feature"" cannot be deactivated. I hope IO patches this.

There are a few bugs here and there. For instance, I had a knocked out character stuck in a wall and I couldn't move him out of sight, it got me spotted and ruined an otherwise perfect run. Alright, probably it was also my fault for forgetting to save my game.

The AI can be exploited, it can be broken, it can feel dumb at times, but really, it still does its job, and overall, the NPCs truly feel alive and convincing. The scripting might need another debugging pass - I saw an (important) character ask for a drink [i]after[/i] he had taken it and started drinking on it. I know, I know, it's just a detail, but still, one might expect such things not to happen.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

The graphics are pretty. Once again, the Glacier engine delivers. The modeling and the texture works are good, even with the quality set to ""medium"". Lightning is really beautiful - not groundbreaking, but still - and overall, there is not much to say about it. The design itself appeals a lot to me, with plenty of details that help immersion and make the game feel believable.

[h1]Technical / Performance[/h1]

I play on Dx11, at 1080p, on the following setup :

Windows 7 x64
GPU : AMD HD7950 3Gb
CPU : Intel Core i7 4970k @ 4GHz
8Gb RAM

And the game runs from a SSD.

I had to put the in-game settings on medium because I had big framerate issues. Sacrificing a few settings - texture quality, detail level, shadow quality, texture filter, AA, etc - didn't render the game much less beautiful. Sadly, it did not improve performance either. Looking at the forums and other reviews, it appears that some people with similar or superior setups are reporting performance issues as well. So, based on that hardware, I should expect a higher performance. Don't get me wrong - it is decent, with 60 fps when the field of view is directed towards the extremity of a level, or when indoors - and it falls to 45 fps when looking at crowds or towards the center of a map. I also notice a slight stuttering when rotating the camera.

I experienced two crashes so far is less than 3 hours of gameplay, once on the very first tutorial mission, another time upon launching the game, as the IO logo was appearing. 

[h1]Sound[/h1]

The sound design is great. The effects are diverse and a particular attention to detail has been paid in that regard. The voice actor work is, as in previous Hitman games, accomplished with a lot of care.

The music is pleasant to hear and contributes in building a proper Hitman ambience. Niels Bye Nielsen did a great job, even if, I'll admit it, I'll need quite some time to get rid of this sour taste Jesper Kyd's absence is giving me.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

This is just the first episode of the ""season"", so, be warned - it can be finished in just an hour (or less). But that's not how a Hitman game is played. There are tons of contents beyond the completion of the three missions. Achievements, challenges, user-made contracts, elusive targets... Well, that part is the job of Square Enix's PR department, I won't do it. In short, there are a lot of things to do if you like Hitman games. Good enough for this first episode.

Now, I decided not to recommend this game for several reasons : first of all, the use of Denuvo. That's right, they chose to put quite a lot of money into buying a licence for that recent DRM. Yes, that's the one that doesn't want to be called ""[b]DRM[/b]"". That means money that could have been invested into paying developers to fix above mentioned bugs and performance issues, has instead been redirected to the pockets of the guys who made the StarForce DRM. And if you buy Hitman, you'll get some files coded by these people in your computer. I would rather have nothing to do with that shіt since I bought the game and since it's already protected by Steam's DRM.

Alright, moving on. The episodic format made a lot of people suspicious. Some of said suspicious people decided to trust IO and Square Enix and bought the game. I am among those people.

I do not regret buying it. I'll admit it, I'm having a lot of fun with this Hitman game. However, I cannot help but feeling like ""I don't like where this is going"".

Being tethered to the servers is not okay. Being plagued with Denuvo is not okay. The bugs and terrible design choices are not okay."

The problem is that it's 2016 and PC Gamer's are constantly forced this kind of shit. Episodic content aside (that's a preference and one I don't particularly enjoy) the game offers incredibly little at this moment in time to warrant a release yet alone what it's done.

There is no sandbox to speak of. Sandbox in IO's context refers exclusively to the fact that it's non-linear and you have multiple points of entry and egress that do not have a specific place in the game.
You're still in an ""instance"" you can't walk away from a mission or go into your own ""home"" or walk around Paris or the such. It's a sham.

The game was delayed in December until March and still many users on Nvidia cards are suffering horrible optimisation performance because of DX12 and most functions are disabled because of a bug in the auto-benchmarking.
I am completely understanding of a first day launch not being perfect, rarely is it ever the case and that's perfectly ok but this game has, at this time, for a standard player, 3 hours of content and a ton of rinse & repeat online/auto-generated missions.

There is lots of polish and the game is incredibly promising for the future as it seems to have returned to its roots; however, unless you are ACHING to play this game you should seriously wait until it's on sale as a full package."

2864,0,0.3426,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","This is exactly what a Hitman game is supposed to be like, and I fucking love it. Great gameplay, huge levels and SO many ways to kill your targets, there's a ton of replayability here. And the game also runs very smoothly on my pc. With a GTX970, a I5 4690 @3.5GHz processor and 16GBs of RAM, I get over 60 fps at almost all times with nearly everything maxed out, except when I walk into crowds, but even then, the frame rate never drops below 40 fps.

Now here are the bad things.

Always online DRM: Why, just fucking why? The game is 100% single player, the only multiplayer aspect that it has are the leaderboards, so why is it that I have to be connected in order to have access to a playable version of this game? For some people, this might not be an issue, but I don't have access to reliable internet, so I'm fucked there. But even when my internet works flawlessly this type of DRM still sucks, because if I'm downloading something on the background or watching a video on a different device, the game just gets SO FREAKING SLOW. And even people with good, reliable internet will have trouble with this, as the game's servers aren't stable at all and will, sometimes, simply not work. I seriously don't understand why bother with DRM like this. The only good thing about it is the fact that people can't cheat on the leaderboards, but that's 500 light years away from being worth all the problems it causes.

Bugs: Half the point of this game are the challenges. Given the fact that you have very little original content, due to the episodic nature of this game, you are left with challenges to complete after completing the mission the first time. But these are VERY buggy, I'd say about a quarter of them won't unlock after you complete them, making you have to redo the whole damn thing and just hoping that this time it will be unlocked. This is completely random, as doing the same exact thing will sometimes grant you the challenge and other times it won't. There are other minor bugs in the game, but the real significant bugs are all challenge related.

Episodic Content: This game is episodic. The game will be released by updates of little original content at a time. In this release, for example, there's about 60-90 minutes of original content, half of which are tutorials. After that it's all replaying the same exact missions in different ways. The major problem with this is that it's going to ruin the story. I can't see how we can get engaged in the game's story, if we're only going to get 5 minutes of cutscenes every month. There's a tiny little bit of story in this first release, but I don't even think about it and completely forget it even exists, just because of how little of it there is. 

Overall, I think it's an incredible Hitman game, and I personally love it. But they made so many stupid choices not while developing the game itself, but all the things around it, that I just cannot recommend it. It's too late to fix the whole episodic thing, but if they get rid of the damned always online DRM, then I'll give this game a thumbs up. But for now I say: Get it if you're a Hitman fan and you like the replayability aspects of the old games, who doesn't mind replaying the same level over and over, who knows the always online DRM isn't going to make the game completely unplayable for you at most times and who doesn't mind the episodic content. It's a long list, I know."

Edit: 10/02/2017

So at this point the entire first seasons out, this is long after the fact that I originally wrote this review.
I could have recommended it at this point, the game has vibes of Blood Money, has its comedic moments, and gives the player enough freedom of choice to do rediculous shit, like drown the entire gala ball in a single toilet. 

I never had any problems with any real glitchiness, other than usual AI dip-shit issues.

HOWEVER, I still doubt that the game is worth 60 dollars (As based on the current Serason 1 bundle price) Especially so long after the initial release. It's a full game now, but I do not believe it to be worth 60 (MAYBE 40)"

   Good Graphics
   No lag with 24GB RAM, i7 & GTX 970
   No long loading with the above
   Open - lots of different options, lots of replayability

The Bad:
   Only a single mission available at launch. 20% of the game available to play today.
   A few ""bugs"" around AI. Some interactions bug out and blending in randomly triggers everyone to be suspicious of you, meaning you have to start from a previous save.
   No ""visual"" effects, such as holstering weapons, the weapons just disappear, putting a body into hiding shows slightly stock based effects.
   
   
The Ugly:
    Always online.... What the actual fudge? Really...? It's 2016 and I'm being kicked back to the menu (losing my current progress since the last auto save) when the servers go down (and they appear to go down quite often...)  To complete the ""Final"" Training mission I had to reload from my existing save 4 times... in an hour!


At present - not worth buying. When they remove the DLC and “always online” element, and add more content, and maybe reduce the price, then it might be worth picking up.

Yes they said it was Paris, but frankly other than the odd French flag didn't feel like it in any way, kind of blew the whole immersive thing for me and I have a feeling Italy will be the same it really could have been Chicargo from Absolution or if they put a Scarecrow in the garden South Dekota!!!

Played thru the 2 main monthly kills pretty much without any trouble(and Im new to this line of games and this type of game baught Absolution last week! ) and as such can't see how they will hold peoples interest for the whole year. to rate it I would say the Hotel at the start of Hitman Absolution and the escape through the library was harder and would people pay for just that??? And that brings me to a bigger point I don't see how all the content they are talking of adding will add up to a whole game(if you consider Absolution the benchmark as what a whole game looks like)????

I guess in one respect the company did listen to the fanbase, people complained that Absolution was too linear, HITMAN seems to be totally the other way,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, pointless

Tried to log in today and.................... locked out 

So all in all I dont think in the state its in its an upgrade on Absolution(but in fairness that was a game I quite enjoyed) and to be honest even if the content wasn't stripped I don't believe its a better game, add to that the technical issues this is one that I would recommend staying away from (sad because I was really looking forward to it)"

So far this is a very disappointing game.

This hitman title was dumbed down not sure why but it was easy as hell, also this game has a really bad DRM problem, the problem being that it's a 24/7 online DRM that blocks you playing the game if it loses connection.

the game ran fine but it's not worth buying this title as it's the worse hitman title yet.

I recommend if you really want to play a hitman title then buy the first, second, and third game, the older hitman titles where much harder to complete and lasted much longer than this title.

Square Enix made another scam after Just Cause 3.(another pile of  garbage with gameplay that sucked, bad performance and their awful server connection as well)

And the gameplay? It just sucked. Well, there was no major improvement in gameplay for this series since blood money, so I don't really expect it to be different (actually, yes, it's just getting even worse and more boring)

Basically the game just doesnt want you to move on, it wants you to replay the same level over and over with so-called ""different approaches"" and contracts that no one gives a crap.

Performance wise I was fine, definitly notice some FPS drops, other than that it went pretty smooth for me.

Was this mission worth the $15, sure. But if you can hold out till the full release. Do that.

Only reason I do not recommend it, is because I feel episodic games really kill the vibe and flow when trying to immerse you as the Hitman. After completing Paris full stealth and only using lethal methods on my target I was ready to jump into the next mission, but unfortunately I'll have to wait until next month.

EDIT: They really need to upgrade Contracts Mode. I just spent an hour finding hard to reach targets in Agent 47's suit in-doors, and kill each one with a sniper rifle. After losing connection to the server I get booted out to the main menu, and while creating a contract you cannot save. So I just re-did the entire contract and performed all my target kills in 47's suit, with a sniper rifle (my assumption was this would make it very difficult to complete my contract). Then I look at it when I'm done and wearing 47's suit is OPTIONAL, and it doesn't require the kills to use the sniper, it just says Fire-arm kill not what specific weapon. The whole point of attempting with the Sniper was it is hard to sneak your way in with a rifle on your back, but hey you can just use a pistol so why even bother.

I love HITMAN games. But as you can see from the reviews so far, it is not good. I am not going to go into detail because other people have. I am just going to say do not buy this game till you see good reviews of performance and bugs, glitches are fixed ect. If you have a really powerful pc (i5 4670k + gtx 780 minimum) then you will get 60fps at low settings 90% of the time. But seriously, this is not acceptable. The PC gaming industry is so degraded the past few years and consumers are being trolled, humiliated and fucked over and over again for our money with games that are not completed.

Internet cut out for a second mid-mission and I had to restart the entire mission. Once I finished the tutorial, I found out I had to download another 2GB download to play the actual Paris mission.  Why did this not download with the rest of the game? Also it's $5 more dollars to ugprade from intro pack to full experience than just buying the full experience? What the heck."

I bought this game (the full game) and started playing it on release.  Can't get past the tutorial area because it freezes.  I have a 4770k processor with 2 gtx 980 tis, and it continues to freeze at the same spot over and over agian.  The gaming inudstry sucks, stick with indie games or wait a year for larger titles to work their crap out.  This game is unfinished and it does nothing good for the game to have been released so early.  It should have been pushed back for at least a couple months.

Of course, this review is only relevant to those who are looking at buying this game within the first month or so of release.


BUYER BE WARNED: This is an unfinished crap product that is not optimized.  If it doesn't eat your performance up you'll run into other issues like I did with freezing etc.  Take this into consideration before you blow 60$

P.S. - After reading some of the forums and replies to this thread, for others out there having the same issue I was (with it freezing) try switching to dx11.  That fixed my freezing issue, hopefully it'll fix yours too!"

Now they release this patient zero thing but they won't let you buy it sepparately, they want you to buy the whole thing twice, I probably would have bought it for w/e the amount but they can get fucked if they are trying to pull shit like this."

Obviously I have the full experience, but the game won't let me play the Showstopper mission in Paris. Really Square Enix?"

Low FPS, constant crashes. I'm unwilling to spend more time in the game for the fear of surpassing the two hour refund limit.

My strongest suggestion is you wait before buying this game."
2976,4,0.6896,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go",The game keeps carshing in the tutorial level. Dont buy this game.

Update: They fixed the issue within 30 minutes it seems by releasing another update. The problem is that they only released 1 level. Now I know that they said it would be released in peaces/sections but 1 level at time I mean really?? come the fuck on????? Now we will have to wait another two moths for the second level of the game to come out?"
2986,1,0.4278,"even, fix, setting, performance, issue, fps, work, pc, beta, low","Where to start massive hitman fan been playing since number 1. 

This game has been f**ked up, cant even get anywhere in it why you ask?

the controls! 

ok we get it you've make the game for a controller and fked all pc games who dont want to use a controller, but seriously IO why are you so lazy and charge £40 for full game, i feel like a mug. 

What do i mean?
B = drag on pad but also on keyboard its so awardward 
2nd when you have to mash the button to get the game to register the interactions you know its bad. 3rd tips come up for the controller not the keyboard.

to quit the game i had to use task manager as its so spastic with the mouse. dont get me started on trying to get into the settings. 

Sod it wont play till they fix it i wish they would stop screwing over their PC fan base. 

my advice wait a while until they actually fix input,

Pros
Graphics, 
and methods of killing"
2987,0,0.5853,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","No upgreadbale gear in loadout screens

Broken disguise system (cant shoot people while hidden, you will get spotted when you come out)

TL;DR: Amputated Blood Money"

Wishlist:
Why isn't there a ""recommend if they fix the bugs / performance"" option :""(


Pros:
- Great visuals in both quality and theme
- Great audio, surroundings and atmosphere
- Open and variable levels give a lot of replay ability
- Settings to vary difficulty however you want it.


cons:
- Always online DRM.
- PC Performance is abhorrent 
- Episodic release was never intended for the game, and it clear.


summary:
Are you ready for HITMAN Blood Money 2? You are... well, tough luck... but this is as close as it gets. The games levels and options are so diverse and spread into so many ways to play it and solve the mission as well as unlocks that it provides an amazing experience. I have enjoyed figuring out the levels and different bits of them over and over immensly.

But its performance is horrible and that alone might be worth waiting for a patch to fix it.... but if you can run it, it'll make you smile and giggle like nothing but a cold blooded murder can."
