6,0,0.5067,"read, control, continue, head, huge, spook, borderline, grenade, pew, review","F.E.A.R. is a standard first-person shooter that uses bullet time—that’s honestly all it is—which came as quite a surprise to me after reading the widespread reviews lauding it as one of the greatest shooters of all time. The plot is the typical what-has-science-done, with an Evil Corporation (as if there were any other kind in video games) in pursuit of engineering super soldiers. So a psychic military commander sends his puppet soldiers to take over Armacham Technology Corporation (ATC) headquarters, a warehouse emporium of weaponry, medikits, and indestructible office equipment. Enter the nameless, mute protagonist, as part of a special army unit designed to face paranormal threats, and his squad mates, who are consistently separated, injured, and subject to all manner of contrived reasons to keep them from interrupting the solo FPS design. “You’re just going to send him in alone???” the radio crackled for the umpteenth time. 

The gunplay was praised again and again as being spectacular, but it’s just a typical FPS experience. F.E.A.R.’s own iteration of the arsenal with which any FPS fan is familiar functions exactly as expected, with one exception; kicking people is far more damaging than multiple machine gun rounds piercing through their torsos. The only distinguishing feature of the gameplay is its infinitely accessible bullet time mode, which trivializes every encounter throughout the entire game, even on the hardest difficulty. Shifting in and out of bullet time mid combat is pretty, but nothing near the level of mind-blowing so universally spouted from critics. It is by no means bad; it’s decent, but only that.

Enemy AI was next on the list of sheer adulation, and was claimed to be “some of the best AI in shooter history.” Imagine my surprise when armored soldiers, who make up 80 percent of the game’s enemies, loudly proclaimed through their megaphone helmets that they were throwing a grenade at me, which then detonated two feet in front of them. I don’t remember if any of them ever did manage to hit me with a grenade, but I do know they were constantly informing me of what they were going to do, or how many of them I had killed. And for some reason, whether I was hiding behind a box, retreating, or charging head on, they would constantly shout at me, “HE’S TRYING TO FLANK US!” It’s not their fault, I suppose; someone built their armor with megaphones in the helmets… but weren’t they supposed to be psychically coordinated soldiers?

I did begin to feel a certain attachment to these armored soldiers, for all their loud, bumbling ineptness. There were many times they could’ve had the drop on me, if only they had not shouted, “SHIT!!!” or something like that when they spotted me. At one point, an armored truck full of them tried to run me over, but when I moved out of the way, they just kept driving, right off a building. Sometimes one of them would shout to the other, “TAKE COVER!!!” to which the other, surrounded by hallways, doors, tables, and walls, would scream, “I DON’T KNOW WHERE TO GO!!!” I even started to let them have all the time they needed to awkwardly wiggle underneath fences or clamber over walls in plain sight of me before I gunned them down. 

Of course, no review of F.E.A.R. would be complete without mentioning the horror, something which critics across the board have deemed bowel-voidingly scary. But it just wasn’t. Throughout the game, several hallucinations occur that are supposed to be unsettling, but 99 percent of them can’t actually hurt you. With no real effect upon the player, and no way to interact with them, the visions take on a haunted house ride kind of feel—spooky happenings just outside the safety of a cart on tracks. I found myself startled once or twice upon turning around to see a little girl just behind me, but when I discovered that I could move toward and back away from her indefinitely to raise and lower the volume of the scary violins, I couldn’t help but laugh. 

The ever popular mechanism of discovered audio tapes takes the form of voicemails, but the majority of them are poor voice actors reading aloud passive aggressive corporate squabbles. They failed to flesh out the story to any further degree than what-has-science-done; the game as a whole never delivers on its narrative. Ambiguity is a useful tool in crafting horror, but F.E.A.R.’s story remains largely undeveloped by the end of the game. I think some developers wanted to make a standard action shooter but were also into Japanese horror films, so the result was a standard action shooter with Japanese horror elements that might as well have been delivered from a TV screen.

I will close with some of the non spoiler questions this game has left me to consider on my sleepless nights. Firstly, why do dead bodies sometimes randomly fly through windows, and why are there so many in the ceilings? ATC headquarters was taken over by psychically controlled soldiers, right? How did they even get the bodies up there in the first place? Or was it the little girl? Was she just stuffing them up through the tiles so they could conveniently fall down as I passed? And why does the protagonist spontaneously combust when he falls into pits? I did it several times out of disbelief, but sure enough, just before the screen went black, orange flames engulfed my entire body. What exactly are those shinless, tan men who float into me and pop like a fleet of suicidal balloons? And why do the armored soldiers sometimes blast off like rockets when I shoot them in bullet time mode? Machine gun fire shouldn’t send an armored body rocketing across a room, bouncing off walls and screaming.

Alright, so I *would* prefer to recommend this game, as its generally enjoyable.

That said...

On Win10 its practically unplayable without a vast amount of needless tedium in creating special files or trying to run other wrappers about it to get it to run in anything other than the base graphics resolutions, which generally creates a great deal of issues for those with more than one monitor. And even without +1 monitors, the micro-stuttering and graphical freezes during the game will result in massive amounts of needless deaths and frustration.

I don't really even understand how this game got famous. I guess people watched ""The Ring"" and saw that this game had a girl that was supposed to be as creepy as the Attack-from-the-killer-TV girl was in ""The Ring. (I thought ""The Ring"" was stupid). But in spite of my hesitation, friends told me to buy this game. I've played it, made the stupid choice to buy the rest of the series and hated every step of the way as friends kept saying ""It gets better. It gets bettter.""

And it doesn't. It gets worse and worse as the developers released expansion packs, you later realize the story of one of them doesn't fit with the rest of the story. So you try to figure out why the story doesn't make any sense and read that the developers decided one of their expansion packs isn't ""Cannon"" (Meaning, that it's apocriphal. Though it's a story set in the same world, the story isn't accepted into the rest of the series).... 

Oh -- WELL THAT'S JUST GREAT! So the developers didn't know what they were doing, wrote and made a game that's completely irrelivant, not fun, not interesting and then decides that it's a bastard child and that you shouldn't have wasted your money... 

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP! I'm going to copy and past this same review for every game in this series...

The story is pretty interesting, and the mad psycho flashes you get can be pretty scary.

30,3,0.985,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","To be very honest, I was quite disappointed. I was actually really hoping to like this game, and I did enjoy it a lot in the first couple of hours or so. But after that I realised that there was nothing more to this game but mindless repetitive shooting. Let me explain. First the good bits. F.E.A.R. has some distinct strength, no doubt. It has very nice and realistic use of lighting and shadows, and also a very clever enemy AI, so enemies actually use teamwork and take cover instead of just running at you. The ability to go into bullet time (slow motion) is also very nice, but that ability is pretty much the leverage point of the entire game. You aren't encouraged to use it, you are forced to use it. If you don't, you die too easily. This makes every single gunfight a mindlessly slow drudgery. You are also given cool melee attacks, but you can be sure you won't use them past the first level, because you almost never get a chance to get that close to the enemy. Action in general - as I said, it's fun for the first couple of hours, but then you realise that every single gunfight is virtually the same as the hundred you've had before. The same types of enemies, the same types of arenas, the same types of guns. Nothing changes! This is boring! And speaking of boring... the levels. I have played more than half of the game, which is quite a number of hours, and I've only encountered 3 types of areas  throughout - sewers, warehouses and offices. That's it. It's the same kind of areas repeating themselves all the time. And there are even several parts of the game where you walk corridor after corridor with nothing happening whatsoever. No enemies and no suspense, just corridors. That heavily detracts from the pace of the game. As for the horror element. Well, it sort of works at first, but after first few levels you realise that none of those ""scares"" actually have any effect on you. They are just images. In games like Doom 3 for example, things that jump at you out of nowhere are actual monsters that can KILL you. In F.E.A.R. nothing that jumps at you can affect you in any bad way. It's totally harmless, so why get scared about it? By all means, F.E.A.R. is a well-made game, I have not encountered any bugs and such, but it's not entertaining at all. It doesn't have interesting puzzles, no story to encourage you to play on. It's just a repetitive shoot em up."
31,3,0.9718,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","I think we can all agree that little scary girls are terrifying. And with so many F.E.A.R. games from so many different publishers, it’s hard to keep up with them.

Story on the other hand, makes no sense!
F.E.A.R. started with a cool idea and turned out to be terribly uninteresting. Things happen to our mysterious hero through “shadows” and “vision” – nothing out of the ordinary, right? But then they made the game an FPS, which means soldiers shoot things, and things got increasingly ridiculous until the game ended up with a plot that didn’t make sense. Oh and let’s not forget the sometimes segued into waking nightmares, where you’re fighting some hooded stranger to the tune of John Carpenter’s Halloween theme.

Enemy AI is impressive, but doesn’t challenge player.
If you played the game, you will be aware of the impressive enemy AI. But my question is this: Why don’t we challenge the player a little more? When you have that many enemies attacking at once, the combat becomes fairly mindless – just hold one button and fire – and that, I’m afraid, can take its toll on some players sanity.

And this level design... I just can't...
"
32,3,0.9525,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","I personally did not enjoy F.E.A.R, I found the game overall to be extremely dated, with the only redeeming feature being the alright story and a bit of the atmosphere. Although, the game does appear to be a favourite among a lot of people, and I'm sure in 2005 it would have been great, but for me personally I did not enjoy. I'm going to list a few of the issues that I had.

I will start by saying I was going into the game looking for a difficult challenge with some exceptional AI.

I will start with combat as I was really disappointed overall. A part of my issue was with the AI so I will talk about it in a different section as its a bit lengthy. The bullet time was cool but very strong, I decided to not really use it through most of the game until I just wanted to be finished, then I abused it through the last couple of chapters to move quicker as it made the game very easy. The enemies shots felt very disconnected between me taking damage and their visual bullets, but maybe I'm loosing my mind. Some weapons are much quieter than others, which at the start with my volume settings some of them were completely quiet (such as the sub machine gun or the rifle) especially compared to the pistol. Before increasing my volume settings there were times that I only noticed I was being shot from the visual bullets or taking damage. The player movement would slide on ramps (e.g., garage level section) and it was quite annoying.

I have separated out my section on AI as it is an area that a lot of people love, but my thoughts are that its okay. I see their intention with attempting to flank or outmanoeuvre my position or communicate with others, but the level design can be very linear making only one or two ways for them to file though to reach your position allowing you to easily pick them off even without any bullet time, especially if you pick your angles. For most of the game you can just hold an angle and then peek around. For larger sections which allow the AI room to breathe and attempt their manoeuvres if you shoot and then move, when you peek again they will be slightly delayed in their attack, and you can take out one or do some damage and then you repeat until the encounters over, or even just move to outflank them yourself. Maybe its my play style that doesn't mesh with the AI, but I'm very used to games where if you peek too far or if you peek so you see multiple enemies you will die. I think in terms of an AI that I was impressed with I would say Trepang2's AI is better or at least the level design allows for more AI freedom while restricting the players movement. If you are actually looking for a challenge I would recommend Trepang2.

The game overall was quite easy, even on the hardest difficulty. While I couldn't just run and gun everywhere, I could very comfortably hold my position take them out and then move on without much resistance. Enemies could very easily kill you, but it wasn't too difficult to take them out first. Managing health is also easy as you can replenish back to full health after each fight with ease with the numerous medkits around. I decided to only ever use a medkit when I picked up a new one to add some difficulty as you can carry around 10 on your person making fights a breeze if you allow yourself to use them when you get low. I would also recommend doing the same to increase the difficulty even slightly. 

I wasn't really immersed either in the game, which detracted quite a bit from my experience. All the levels just felt like labyrinths which made them not very believable as being an actual location, especially the office levels. A lot of the sections felt more like a unity office asset flip on a basic shooter level.

The game was also a little on the shorter side only taking 6.2hrs to complete looking at my playtime on steam. This included time wondering around the maps looking for voicemails, intractable laptops and the health/reflex boosters which at least for the health boosters I ended up grabbing the majority of as I reached 185hp or 17/22 boosters collected.

Not related to the game but it is quite unfortunate that the game is only available via a bundle as it meant that I needed to spend a little more than I would have liked, and now I own a number of other F.E.A.R games that I am unsure if I will play.

Overall it wasn't bad, its just not what I was looking for."
33,3,0.948,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","Expected a cool horror shooter, got fragments of mediocre horror and an overwhelming amount of filler.

%60 of this game takes place in an brightly lit office building with little to no variation in aesthetics. I have absolutely no nostalgia for this game so I can safely say that if you do decide to pick this up play for like 2-3 hours and put it down. What you're doing at the start of the game is actually more fun than towards the end as the gameplay pretty much devolves into a cover shooter after you leave the office since enemies damage and numbers are ramped way up."
34,3,0.9437,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","Lets call this 'baby's first horror game.'  Game is divided up into 'horror' and 'action' segments.  Meaning in the first you see creepy things and in the second you shoot clone soldiers.

AI reactivity is pretty good, even if all encounters have scripted beginnings (enemies wont spawn until you reach certain points, the game gives you rocket launchers before you fight robots, etc).  They throw grenades and quickly flank you.  There really isn't any stealth potential aside from catching enemies in the middle of their scripts.

Horror elements are only scary if you jump easily.  Game objects will fly across the room, random blood pools, lights flicker, or you have a weird hallucination, but nothing will attack you.  The only times you need to shoot in horror segments are against slowly moving phantasms, against ninjas (which only show up in two segments), and at the very end of the game where phantasms appear outside of hallucinations.

Not too difficult on 'hard', an OK game for cheap."
35,3,0.9383,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","Pretty disappointed to be honest, after years of praise and hearing how amazing this game was I was genuinely excited to play this but after my playthrough I can't say this is an experience I will look fondly towards to.

I will start from some nit picks and will build up towards my biggest complaints here.

-Weapon models that aren't copy paste of real world weapons are terrible, they feel like slapped together parts of real and fictional weapons and  in general were really ugly.
-I don't know why but in the middle of the game my fram erate would drop to single digits for no god damn reason.
-Whenever I closed the game and re open it my key binds would go back to their default state which was really annoying
-There is a severe lack of environments, for the most part of the game you either fight in warehouses or office buildings,
-The scenery in this game also looks like it is a generation behind even for it's time, the blocky buildings with really bad shading just outside of the window of the building I am in looks really weird.
-Guns have that shaky feeling that it makes it look like my character purposefully shaking it to simulate recoil   which makes automatic weapons really frustrating to use

Now onto my biggest complaint, the story and the characters, the story is told through one of my least favorite method of storytelling, logs. I wouldn't mind them as much if fear had actual characters that I could get some exposition from, but characters in fear are utterly one dimensional tropes that barely have any screen time, whenever I thought I would get some time to get to know the Asian chick and black guy whose name I forgot some shit happens and they have to stay behind. The story is also pretty generic, a standard super soldier experiment gone wrong type of beat with a scare that was super generic even for its time. Overall I can not say I enjoyed this game as much as I would like to and left me with a bad taste in  my mouth, hope the second game will be better."
36,3,0.9245,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","I just finished playing through F.E.A.R. With a title like that, I expected a shooter with lots of scares. The thing is, the horror in this game is mostly just creepy; I remember ONE memorable scare (on a ladder) but everything else was just... eh. The ""scary parts"" are preceded by sound effects that aren't sudden but ease in, making it not scary. Many times I would hear this creepy sound coming in, then look around for something scary and see a figure walking around a wall. Oooh. 

As a shooter, I like the way the guns work and the bullet-time reflex slomo stuff is fun to play around with. As a story, I thought it was interesting but not compelling. As for gameplay in general, there is a lot of backtracking and it can be frustrating walking around looking for the exit to the next section. The enemies are boring with the occasional ""boss"" every once in a while. No monsters or scary things to shoot at here - just soldiers. Lots and lots of soldiers. 

The game took me about me about 8 hours to finish on normal difficulty. Overall, if you're looking for a shooter you can play when you want to shoot stuff, this game is pretty fun. The slomo fighting is probably the best part of the game. If you're looking for a horror game, don't bother with this one. It isn't scary and doesn't really have a lot of horror actually in it. There's a bunch of blood and skeletons but nothing actually horrifying. 

Gameplay: 7/10
Horror: 4/10
Story: Didn't really pay attention. I was too busy waiting for scares, lol. Pretty predictable, 5/10 maybe."
37,3,0.9177,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","For full disclosure I have to confess that I only just played this for the first time as I missed it when it originally came out. It is quite possible that in its day it was new and innovative and certainly I've heard good things about its sequel and I'm going to play that next.

The plus points are that there are a number of weapons, the story is interesting with a mix of flashbacks/hallucinations, and it is atmospheric in places.

However, the gameplay becomes very repetitive very quickly with enemies generally doing the same thing (although I believe the AI was innovative in its day) and the lack of weapon choices often means you're trying your best to conserve ammo in a game which isn't really designed for that (particularly as health kits seem to be in almost inexhaustible supply).

I also found that the story was quite difficult to follow with very few clues as to what was actually going on. I know that there are now plenty of forums out there to explain and so on, but for the most part it didn't feel suspenseful as if they were gradually feeding me info, it felt like I largely had no real clue of motivation or what was happening. I largely remained baffled as to who the people were who I was shooting at and why I should hate them.

Like I said, it's possible that it has now been copied so many times and elaborated upon so many times that none of this matters now, but I'm not sure it stands up as a particularly great game."

+ Superb level design which doesn't get you lost but doesn't hold your hand either while managing vast labyrinth-like spaces.

[h1]And so we come to the bad...[/h1]
- The graphics haven't aged well. It was on the low end already in 2005 when it came out compared to other games of that year and it looks the more robust and simple today.
- It followed the footsteps of it's predecessors that had this logical flaw of collectables like heavy weapons and ammo lying around in places where they should not be, like in an office building. Or security gun turrets that descend from an office ceiling.
- The story and lore was executed through written material and recordings that forced you to sit tight while it was delivered. It was harmful towards the pace of the game, felt uninspiring to follow and actually I couldn't care less about it.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Technology expires, games do too and there's really nothing truly valuable F.E.A.R. can offer to the demanding player of today."
39,3,0.8965,"horror, time, enemy, feel, level, look, go, make, shoot, really","As a late-comer to the game, it's hard for me to write a review that captures how I really feel about the game. It's an old game - it just is... But is this a bad thing? Well, for its time, it was quite revolutionary in its AI development, partical physics, subtle scare tactics complimenting in your face horror, and lighting effects. Playing in 2017, the graphical aspects weren't anything spectacular, but I didn't expect them to be - we've come a ridiculously long way since then lol The AI is something that people gush over allllll the time when they talk about the game, and I have to agree with them for the most part. Hearing the enemy communicate and act on commands and prompts was interesting and could definitely put you in a spot of trouble or help you catch a massive case of death. The sparse enemy variation means that you'll be able to figure out fairly quickly how enemies operate and be able to deal with them, but that doesn't mean they'll act the exact same way every fight. The gunplay isn't bad - double pistols is still double pistols (looks badass but isn't accurate in the slightest), shotguns blow up enemies at close range, and long range combat is appropriately difficult. All this being said, I wanted to like this game. I REEEEEALLY wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. Mostly because of the horror aspect. The game just isn't scary. Like in the slightest - not by today's standards, anyway. There's just too many ridiculously scary games out there - many of them probably taking notes from this game but with better hardware to power there spooky visions. The story of Alma and her quest for revenge is still and will always be bloody and tragic, but it's just not enough for a recommendation from me. If you're looking for a classic FPS that was an excellent stepping stone for its time, you've found it. If not and you're like me looking for a scary military FPS, then you'll probably feel about like I do."

Have you ever experienced the sensation of ""No more of this""? Well, because this videogame is intense, with a really frustrating AI, too long... i'm afraid this videogame is too much for me

Postdata:
If for any reason the videogame tells you ""Disconnected from server"", you must run the .exe with administrator permissions

About F.E.A.R.: Extraction Point and F.E.A.R.: Perseus Mandate:
They have forced me to play it with the lowest graphics otherwise they close
I guess i'll come back again when i'm mentally ready for all of this"
41,4,0.8572,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price","Buy a key from G2A for like eight dollars, terrific game that has aged well but not worth it being sandwhiched in dogshit games for higher price."
42,4,0.8382,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price",Very very good game for its time and still good to this day if the game didnt crash all the time got my refund asap unfortunately. do not purchase always crashes
43,4,0.8334,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price","Great game, but you have to buy the entire fear bundle just to get it for some fucking reason. Buy it on GOG, the other two are barely worth playing."
44,4,0.817,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price",Its terrible how they raised the price of a 13 year old game to 55 dollars right before the winter sale
45,4,0.8032,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price","Ehhhh did not age well, runs like crap even on brand new gaming laptop which runs any other game on max settings, this game runs at 15 fps top and wont even support proper controller support, and frankly aged poorly, it's been so long since I've played this originally it just did not age well at all, original half life runs better than this.

Not even worth the 8 bucks I spent and getting my money back it's a franchise that has been abandoned long ago at this point and no workshop for mod support to perhaps improve the games."
46,4,0.8012,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price","WB Interactive has raised the price to nearly sixy h*cking dollars. I'm not saying F.E.A.R. isn't worth $60, but please just get this from a Humble Bundle or something. OR, if you REALLY want to kick a completely braindead publisher in the pants, don your peg leg and eyepatch for an even better deal for yourself.
Awesome game, incredible series, truly awful publisher."
47,4,0.8004,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price","Game is great, but the fact that you can't buy it by itself and have to buy it with every other F.E.A.R. is just unacceptable. Just fucking pirate it at this point."
48,4,0.787,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price",when u get like 40 hour its just loading for ever and u actully never load in but insane game 10/10 but wont launch
49,4,0.7858,"fear, buy, worth, well, even, great, sale, bundle, really, price",It was a really fun game until you get to Point of Entry. Game will crash if you are higher than max settings and prevent you from continuing the game. I had to finish by importing my save over to the GOG version which has a fan made 4gb patch. Too bad steam ver. isnt compatable.
