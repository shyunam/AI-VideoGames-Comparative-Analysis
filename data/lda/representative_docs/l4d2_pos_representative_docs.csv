I am a single farther to my son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.
