I want this game to be great.  I'm a half-competitive player, half-social player. I appreciate depth of play and discussing it with like-minded people.  Co-operative learning, people helping each other becoming their best selves.

[h2]Before I review this game, I would like to describe my own competitive gameplay philosophy:[/h2]

[b]-An option presents a choice for a player to make.

-Players must be given many options when they compete at something.

-Counter-play must exist for each option and must have the same, or more demand in skill as the option it is answering.

-A high-skill option needs an equal-skill or higher-skilled counter-play to answer it.

-Counter-play is considered an option and should therefore also have its own counter-play.  

[h3]This philosophy causes the skill floor of the competition to gradually raise as player skill increases and creates a natural learning curve[/h3]

-At a medium/high level of play, a game should feel like a conversation without words.  Expressive through your decisions made in the game, understood by your opponents and given a response.  This is called Proficiency.

-The more options, the more depth of play

-The more options, the higher the skill cap

-The smaller the skill cap, the shorter amount of time it takes for a community to ""solve"" a game and for its lifespan to end[/b]

This is what I look for in a game worth my time.  This is my understanding of how players are rewarded for engaging with the game and its community.

[h1]Review:[/h1]

Halo Infinite feels [b]smooth as butter, looks amazing, sounds amazing, and has many intelligently designed maps.[/b]  I feel like I'm playing [b]a game that was designed with the long-term player in mind.[/b]  Halo Infinite also plays like an arcade shooter meant for somebody who didn't grow up loving Halo, its pacing, and its skill demands.

Campaign was... fun.  Just fun, but a lot of it.  They've done better, and I don't feel like this is the ""LASO challenge"" game I used to spend hours with friends on, but I look forward to doing stupid shit with my friends in the sandbox during my downtime.  I play a lot of Vermintide 2 now to make up for this hole in my life.  It has the same feeling.  Adjustable difficulty, player-set pace, fun with friends.  Completing LASO weeklies in Halo Reach on weekends is something I still have fond memories of.

[b]Multiplayer also has many pitfalls that reduce a player's options and does not reward active thinking.[/b]  This has to be broken down in separate parts:

One of the things that I like about the multiplayer is the time spent on your sandbox options, by that I mean, the ""creative thinker"".  You've got potential for outplays when your weapons are trash, but its not a crutch, and its not cheese (small brain, big play).  Vehicles, however, feel weak and unimportant when an objective isn't in play.

[b]Team co-ordination feels like its at an all-time high[/b] due to the mobility that players have.  I love being able to platform myself around the arenas whether its with sprint, grapple, or just smart choices on where to jump and ledge-climb.  I've realized that movement is king in a good shooter.  An arena is only as fun as a player's ability to navigate it and use their knowledge outmaneuver their opponent.  Aiming was never the end all/be all to a classic FPS.  [b]Good movement increases demand from aim.  Good aim increases demand from movement.  Right now, there is either too low or too high a demand for aim depending on circumstances.[/b]

[b]Sprint has become very accessible.[/b]  When Sprint was added in Halo Reach, it was the ultimate utility item due to the options it added compared to other items that would take its spot.  This still exists (and now, Grapple Hook is the new Sprint), though players are not punished for using it improperly.  Unlimited sprint =/= unlimited options.  You are not given a resource to manage.  [b]You are given a ""Go"" button that does not require any commitment to use.[/b]  This is not a problem on its own, but pairing it with the other multiplayer changes creates a problem with the core Halo product.  I did say movement is king in a good shooter.

[b]Good weapons with low skill floors[/b] is a way that I would describe the current Halo Infinite meta.  Rockets, ARs, Swords.  All fun to use, all no-brainer weapons.  There are some well-designed guns in this game.  Ravager AoE, Shock Rifle crowd control.  Lots of utility in different guns.

The Commando is a meme.  The Battle Rifle is a shell of its former self.  I still don't know what to make of the new covenant DMR.  Sniper Rifle is literal counter-play to marksman rifles and invalidates all of these when it is in play.

[b]Marksman weapons have always been the staple of Halo.  This game feels like the antithesis of every Halo meta that came before it.[/b]  I am not rewarded by picking these weapons up, no matter how familiar I am with how to use them.  This is not only evident by its own one v. one, static experience i.e. Two players shooting eachother, one with an AR, one with a BR on a flat surface with no external influences, but this is magnified by the design of most maps.

[b]Close-range combat is king by every means.[/b]  Maps are claustrophobic to anyone not holding onto an AR or a Shotgun.  Players can easily out-play marksman rifles on most maps and in most areas of those maps.  This benefits faster, rushdown playstyles.  This forces high-commitment engagements.  This limits options and counter-play.  [b]When I see another player inside BR range, whether or not I have one, we are going to fight to the death and it will be over in under eight seconds.[/b]  Short engagement time leads to less decisions, less options, less counter-play.  Short kill time leads to less decisions, less options, less counter-play.  [b]Less intelligent gameplay[/b]

[h2]So you're probably thinking...  Less options, but the game added more options.  This guy is full of himself[/h2]

You're right, but I'm right too.  This review is selfish.  It's made out of want.  Wanting something I've only experienced a handful of times in my life.  [b]Every time I have, its come from games that have lived for over a decade.[/b]  Something hits different with them.

[b]Play the game yourself.  The multiplayer is free.  While you're playing, I want you to think about the things I pointed out.  How many options do you really have when there's another player on the screen?  Are you having a conversation, or are you just shouting at each other, hoping to win a screaming match?  When do you get to use the sandbox that the designers put you inside?  When does the game feel cerebral and reactive to your choices instead of fueled by dopamine from a cool or close kill?[/b]

To me, the game is close, but likely too far away from what I want out of my gameplay experience.  Too watered down.  I hope that changes.  I hope movement stays king, but aim requirements are raised.  I hope there's a longer time to kill so that players have more opportunities to make smart choices and be rewarded for making the right ones.  I'm just one weird player talking about weird gameplay concepts, though.  I needed to write this all down so I'm not thinking about it anymore and so I can move on and find something better to do with my downtime.

[h3]If you made it this far and you were able to find what I'm looking for in this game by your own experience, I'd love to hear about it.  Shoot me a line.  Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places.[/h3]"

6,0,0.7363,"weapon, player, feel, challenge, map, armor, system, also, progression, experience","Halo Infinite stumbles into the gaming arena with an unfortunate clunkiness that's hard to overlook. Its gameplay feels trapped in a weird limbo between being too dated and not embracing the charm of its nostalgic roots. The question of why this game is free to play lingers like a persistent glitch, as most players would gladly pay a premium for a fully polished and finished AAA product. Regrettably, Halo Infinite fails to deliver on that front, leaving gamers with an underwhelming experience that misses the mark on multiple levels. The prospect of paying a premium for this mishmash of dated design choices and lackluster execution is a hard pass for discerning players seeking a more satisfying and engaging gaming adventure."
7,0,0.7339,"weapon, player, feel, challenge, map, armor, system, also, progression, experience","Halo isn't that good, combat feels ok. Too much of a focus on the battle pass and leveling up and customizing armor and all of that. I just wanna shoot some Spartans not play doll dress up and change my Spartans armor and brush his hair"
8,0,0.733,"weapon, player, feel, challenge, map, armor, system, also, progression, experience","As a devoted Halo fan since the franchise's inception, diving into Halo Infinite was an eagerly anticipated experience. Clocking in over 90 hours, including time on my Xbox console, it's disheartening to admit that the latest installment in the series left me with mixed feelings.

Let's start with the positive aspects. The gameplay, at its core, maintains the essence of what makes a Halo game enjoyable. However, the execution feels somewhat clunky, lacking the seamless flow that defined the earlier titles. This, paired with the unnecessary intricacies of the user interface, marred the overall experience. Navigating through an onslaught of submenus just to customize appearances feels like an arduous task, a stark departure from the simplicity of previous games.

One of the major letdowns is the game's shift towards a Games as a Service (GAAS) model. In a departure from the 'play to earn' ethos of earlier titles, nostalgic armor designs are now locked behind high-priced cosmetics, a move that feels disappointingly primitive. The emphasis on purchasing cosmetics for personal Spartan customization is evident, but the broken pre-match showcase feature undermines the very purpose of showcasing your unique designs, rendering them drab and dull due to lighting issues.

While the gunplay remains smooth, the lack of weapon variety is a glaring flaw. The absence of dual-wielding, a feature that added depth to the iconic Halo 3, is a disappointing regression. The game's insistence on redundancy in weapons limits the potential for diverse and engaging encounters, leading to repetitive gameplay.

On a positive note, the Fiesta gametype injects much-needed fun into the experience, although the absence of fan-favorite SWAT is a notable disappointment. The oversized maps in big team battles contribute to more running than actual fighting, deviating from the fast-paced, close-quarters engagements that defined earlier Halo games.

The graphics, a crucial aspect of any modern game, present a mixed bag. At times, Halo Infinite looks strikingly similar to its predecessor, Halo 3, a game released over a decade ago. This inconsistency in visual fidelity diminishes the immersive potential of the game.

In conclusion, Halo Infinite fails to live up to the expectations of a long-time fan. The clunky gameplay, convoluted UI, and misguided focus on monetizing cosmetic aspects erode the core elements that made the franchise iconic. While some aspects shine through, the overall experience leaves much to be desired, making it difficult to recommend this installment to fellow Halo enthusiasts."
