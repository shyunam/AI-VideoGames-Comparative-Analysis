6,0,0.8723,"run, crash, shader, issue, setting, fix, hour, patch, fps, review","Game looks and plays very well for me, 2080ti, Intel 5960 with 32GB ram. Almost didn't purchase it because of all the negative reviews.

Make sure to install new drivers before loading shaders; if you start up the game and it loads the shaders, when you install new drivers you'll need to reload the shaders, which is a PITA. So, if you get a notification about out of date drivers, quit out and download the drivers first, then load the shaders. Takes about an hour to load the shaders, but after that has been smooth sailing for me."
