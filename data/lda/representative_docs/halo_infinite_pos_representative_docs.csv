The melee is broken or something because the damage it does is not consistent. It shouldn't be that I put out some damage on someone without them taking any damage out of me and they win boxing match when I go to melee them. Thats not how that should work. Its so aggravating, 343 please fix this."

I am a single father to my son, who is now 14. My son recently started playing Halo Infinite.
In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours.
This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son
because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam
account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game
since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing Halo Infinite.
I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games
reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought
me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well."

8,0,0.7893,"time, go, make, say, want, give, way, even, see, thing","Apparently an update changed how the game settings work, and the game had no idea how to work with the old settings file. I deleted that file and was able to play again. This game is a lot more fun than I remember!
Old Review:
The game doesn't work. Just stuck at a blank screen after hitting ""Enter"" to play. No, the official fix of deleting windows credentials doesn't fix it either. Changing what drive it's in just makes it crash during the loading screen. I just don't get to play anymore."
9,0,0.7862,"time, go, make, say, want, give, way, even, see, thing",I'm not a fan boy for any console but find it odd that so many people are leaving bad reviews and yet in game the achievements show that very few have earned them. It's almost like people are leaving reviews for a game they didn't play.
10,1,0.8153,"map, mode, new, well, feel, add, need, still, content, system","343 is now under new leadership and in my opinion for the better. With the season 5 update, the game has more content like Forge AI, firefight, new maps and modes, and ranked arena changes. Other features that were missing on release that's now in the game are a custom games browser, and a progression ranking system. There's something for everyone - both casual and competitive players. This is how the game should've released and it's really fun."
11,1,0.8089,"map, mode, new, well, feel, add, need, still, content, system","It's getting better, specific cosmetic types are becoming crosscore, forge is coming out...
and uhm... yeah.
Forge is coming out."
12,1,0.8065,"map, mode, new, well, feel, add, need, still, content, system","The game is much improved since launch. The latest update provided a custom server browser for forge based maps, which is the best thing they could have added to this game."
13,1,0.7892,"map, mode, new, well, feel, add, need, still, content, system","it has fantastic gameplay but no content, still a good game just needs some elbow grease update: it's at a better place now but is still lacking in content compared to it's predecessors"
14,1,0.7647,"map, mode, new, well, feel, add, need, still, content, system","Armor system and monetization in general is lackluster, but it's a good game after getting a few seasons in."
15,1,0.761,"map, mode, new, well, feel, add, need, still, content, system","haven't played since release until now, game is in a much better place now with the map and playlist variety"
16,1,0.7577,"map, mode, new, well, feel, add, need, still, content, system","its now in the state it should have been in at launch, now all it needs is cross-core customization and then after that just actual content like more maps and f2p events"
17,1,0.7478,"map, mode, new, well, feel, add, need, still, content, system","Season 03 has been a refreshing change to content, delivering new game modes, maps and better battlepasses."
18,1,0.7451,"map, mode, new, well, feel, add, need, still, content, system","Finally feels like a complete game after two years, even if I still have many issues with it. One of the best free-to-play games on the market, I highly recommend."
19,1,0.741,"map, mode, new, well, feel, add, need, still, content, system","The core gameplay has always been good, just needed more content, a functioning forge mode, and better cosmetic customization options. The game now has a proper amount of content, forge mode is functioning but can defenitely use a UI overhaul / a better featured map system, and cosmetic options have improved with cross armor core customization options being added. Would still love to see playable elites. Also please improve the load times / shader optimization process on initial boot, it's way too long (~5-10 mins)."

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
