5,0,0.7821,"great, fun, amazing, story, love, like, really, recommend, graphic, gameplay",Very fun and interactive. Lots to do and explore. Great story line
6,0,0.781,"great, fun, amazing, story, love, like, really, recommend, graphic, gameplay",I am a huge LOTR fan and loved this game. Definitely recommend it. Plays a lot like an assassins creed game.
7,0,0.7787,"great, fun, amazing, story, love, like, really, recommend, graphic, gameplay","Fantastic story, great and tight gameplay, if you are interested and have enjoyed this style of game, I highly suggest picking it up if you can afford it."
8,0,0.7715,"great, fun, amazing, story, love, like, really, recommend, graphic, gameplay","Amazingly fun game. Great visuals, great story line, great gameplay. I highly recommend it."
9,0,0.7603,"great, fun, amazing, story, love, like, really, recommend, graphic, gameplay","Great game had fun
If you like the Batman: Arkham games and the Assassin's Creed games you love this a great mix of both."
10,1,0.9017,"time, feel, mission, hour, really, thing, story, much, bit, first","It is a very fun game I dont want to take anything away from that I enjoyed every moment I put into it. However my complaint is only that It was very short. I put in just shy of 40 hours, completed the main mission line and a fair amount of side missions, leveled up all the way up, and feel no need to go back."
11,1,0.8577,"time, feel, mission, hour, really, thing, story, much, bit, first","This was a good game, but not brilliant. After a while it gets quite monotonous, but the base game kept me gripped enough to see it all the way through to the end.

The DLC was just a bit too much of the same, with minor differences to the base game. I didn't get past ten minutes of either story campaign.

Expect tons and tons of fighting, with a few cutscenes here and there. Don't expect a massive difficult boss fight at the end.

Everything is a lot of work with little reward, but don't let this put you off if it's on special again."
12,1,0.8538,"time, feel, mission, hour, really, thing, story, much, bit, first",A very well made game. Each main mission is harder than the last but are beatable once you know what to do. I really enjoyed it a lot. Plus you have a choice to keep playing the game and 100% it on everything but that's a much harder task but it's up to you.
13,1,0.8532,"time, feel, mission, hour, really, thing, story, much, bit, first","Put way too much of my time into this game. It becomes REALLY easy in the late game to the point where you have to handicap yourself. Overall, good game but needs to be a lot harder."
14,1,0.8504,"time, feel, mission, hour, really, thing, story, much, bit, first","There is a reason this game has gone ""Game of the Year"". 

For a while, I entertained thoughts of trying another game or two while in progress on this one, only to decide that I'd spend a little time with Shadow of Mordor and then try the other game(s). Then I lost track of time and didn't want to move on. I've since given up of playing other games for the time being."
15,1,0.8416,"time, feel, mission, hour, really, thing, story, much, bit, first","fun game, short main mission, and final boss was a let down, played many hours on it, and working to finish it 100% if you find it too easy try some of the other games that come with, like the one where you play as celebrinbor and fight soruman, that is a hard one. then again I am not a very good gamer lol. 

once you get a hang of the controls, its fairly easy. but a fun game."
16,1,0.8364,"time, feel, mission, hour, really, thing, story, much, bit, first","It's a fun game, but there are a lot of quick-time events.  They get really annoying if you keep mouse acceleration on, since you have to move your cursor into a reticule before you can press the button to finish the QTE.  You can play most of the game without them, but there are a few of them you need to complete to progress in the game."
17,1,0.8345,"time, feel, mission, hour, really, thing, story, much, bit, first",Fairly good game at some point it feels a bit repetitive and grindy especially if you want to finish all the achievements
18,1,0.8337,"time, feel, mission, hour, really, thing, story, much, bit, first",First time in a long time that I pulled an all nighter for a game.  I got roughly 60 hours of play from beating the game 100% and getting all the achievements.
19,1,0.8335,"time, feel, mission, hour, really, thing, story, much, bit, first","Pretty good, however it was a bit short with me completing all the main story missions in just 10 hours. I've spent a couple more hours messing about with the captains but this game is likely retired until we get some DLC."
20,2,0.8954,"kill, captain, enemy, orc, orcs, make, die, take, fight, power","Got killed by a random uruk while fighting a warchief.
He advanced and became captain.
I sent a death threat to him, but helped him becoming a warchief without branding him.
Stabbed him in the back right after and got an epic rune.

11/10 would do again."
21,2,0.8948,"kill, captain, enemy, orc, orcs, make, die, take, fight, power","This game had me giggling and kicking my feet like a child when I bow-teleport killed an enemy off of a beast I was riding while my branded captain betrayed his master, causing his master (and the remaining 2 of his bodyguards) to flea because they all had a “fear of betrayal.”"
22,2,0.8939,"kill, captain, enemy, orc, orcs, make, die, take, fight, power","Saw orc, killed.
Saw another orc, killed.
Saw orc captain, killed.
Saw orc warchief, killed.
Saw caragor, killed.

Would kill Sauron again. 11/10"
23,2,0.8933,"kill, captain, enemy, orc, orcs, make, die, take, fight, power","Kill uruks. Get killed by uruks. Kill more uruks. Get killed again. Poison uruks. Stomp on them while riding a cave troll. Control their minds, make them fight each other, and then reward their loyalty by making all their heads explode at once. 

10/10"
24,2,0.8894,"kill, captain, enemy, orc, orcs, make, die, take, fight, power","kill the orcs, slay the orcs, destroy the orcs
you returned late home that night
evidence all around you from the fight
you see your familys blood spilled on the ground
theres no trace of the orcs to be found
take the broadsword in your hand
follow the orcs to their camp
you will have vengeance in blood
with their heads they will pay the price
spill blood
on their trail we hunt them tirelessly
spill blood
bloodshed eases their loss
spill their blood
their decapitation leads to the cessation
of the sadness, of the woe
spill the blood"
25,2,0.8831,"kill, captain, enemy, orc, orcs, make, die, take, fight, power","- kill Orcs
- sneak up from behind and murder your enemies
- walk up to a camp and obliterate everything in your path with your bow
- just straight make your enemies heads explode
- ride a frickin' Graug

10/10, 100/100 best game, best game
"
26,2,0.8781,"kill, captain, enemy, orc, orcs, make, die, take, fight, power","When I overheard a group of Urok huddled around the campfire telling tales of my murders and referring to me as the immortal gravewalker, I realized that I am playing the killer in a horror movie. 10/10 would terrorize those pesky teenagers again."

He came back 5 minutes later and I fed him to a Carragor

He THEN showed up 15 minutes later and I cut his head off

The only way I could stop Crotch the Pelt-Sniffer (mightiest warboss in all the land) was with some severe mind-buggery to make him the mightiest bitch in all the land"
30,3,0.8369,"system, combat, world, well, make, nemesis, awesome, open, mechanic, series","Not as large as some open world games, the interesting systems and fluid combat make this a worthwhile experience."
31,3,0.8362,"system, combat, world, well, make, nemesis, awesome, open, mechanic, series","the combat is fluid and enjoyable, the world is huge and the story compelling... what more could you ask for in an action rpg styled game??"
32,3,0.8239,"system, combat, world, well, make, nemesis, awesome, open, mechanic, series",Assassin's Creed crossed with Lord of the Rings incorporating a nemesis system and unique personalities for each enemy has made this game a must play. Super awesome experience!
