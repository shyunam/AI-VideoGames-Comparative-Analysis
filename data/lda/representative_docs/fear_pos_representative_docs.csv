Some of the most satisfying gunplay I've ever experienced. It's a poor horror game (as are 90% of horror games), but it's a solid FPS with a creepy atmosphere."

3,0,0.7547,"horror, action, make, shooter, experience, ever, atmosphere, fear, element, excellent","F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assault Recon), released by Monolith Productions in 2005. This gem
still delivers a gripping and unique experience. The game blends intense first-person shooter action with psychological horror, creating an atmosphere that keeps you on edge throughout.

The story revolves around a mysterious little girl named Alma, whose psychic powers have unleashed chaos. The narrative unfolds through environmental clues, creepy messages, and eerie hallucinations, keeping you engaged and curious.

Despite its age, F.E.A.R.'s graphics hold up well, especially the impressive lighting effects that enhance the horror element. The sound design is outstanding, with unsettling ambient noises and chilling whispers that make playing with headphones a must.

The gameplay is a perfect balance of intense firefights and nerve-wracking horror moments. The enemy AI is smart and challenging, and the slow-motion mechanic adds a strategic layer to the combat. Just when you start feeling comfortable, the game throws in a creepy apparition or sudden scare to keep your heart racing.

F.E.A.R. remains a standout title for its atmospheric storytelling, intelligent AI, and genuinely creepy ambiance. It's an unforgettable experience that still holds its own against modern games and is well worth revisiting."

IT IS DEFINITELY A GAME THAT EVERYONE SHOULD TRY AT LEAST ONCE."
41,4,0.8376,"enemy, weapon, take, also, feel, gun, make, thing, time, even","Hands down one of the best FPS games ever made.  Why people call it a horror FPS is beyond me though.  I did not find the game frightening at all aside from a couple jump scares.  Best gun play and attention to detail.  Bullets rip out chunks of dry wall and bullets will spark off certain materials.  This is all magnified by the slow mo ability.  The AI is easily some of the best in an FPS ever.  They will flank you, grenade your position if you stay in one place for too long, and lean around cover just like you can.  Enemy variety is limited but they are tough.  You have standard troopers, big armored suits, and even small mechs that are quite deadly.  Your melee attacks are also very powerful and you can also execute a jump kick and a slide kick.  The story isn't bad and you learn about it through scripted events, voice mail messages, and laptops littered throughout levels.

A couple things I didn't care for.  This is basically a corridor shooter with a more open or varied area from time to time.  Environments mainly consist of industrial areas, office parks, and secret underground labs.  The weapon variety is standard fare until about half way through the game when you start finding way more interesting weapons like the rail gun, the autocannon, and the multirocket launcher.  It's a short game, but it's worth another playthrough or two if you like experiencing different difficulties."
42,4,0.8233,"enemy, weapon, take, also, feel, gun, make, thing, time, even","Best Ai i ever seen.  They will work as a team. i've seen them flank whilst putting pressure on you. retreat when injured, call out whenever you attempt to flank. Wait for you to peek your head out behind cover and become wide open to their attack.   And much more.
 Why can't more games have this AI?"

46,4,0.7845,"enemy, weapon, take, also, feel, gun, make, thing, time, even","That game plays with shadows like no other, even today it works perfectly. Multiplayer is down but the campaign will assure you something like 10 hours of tension, a genius mix of horror/scary sequences and tough combats. Despite the lack of MP mode you'll find it quite challenging even on normal difficulty, not really hard at all, but you'll have to use wisely your bullet time, grenades, weapons, medkits, quicksaves and take good cover when under fire of multiple ennemies. AI is not the brightest ever but Replica's bullets can put you down very quickly if you stay too long in sights. 
The best comes once you get familiarized with the game: you'll be able to use bullet time not only before shooting at large groups of ennemies but also after to make beautiful slowdowns of your destructions :) 
I don't see any negative point, maybe the lack of various environnements: most of the game you'll make your way through relatively empty and similar streets, offices, storages, labs, can be a little boring for some people but Alma, Fettel, Replicas troopers and other ""things"" kept me alert all the time."
47,4,0.7756,"enemy, weapon, take, also, feel, gun, make, thing, time, even","Kinda keeps up with today standards.
Pros:
- Interesting story.
- Somewhat smart AI. They try to hide, flank you and etc.

Cons:
- Unavoidable damage in most cases, so it get really annoying while playing on high difficulties. When you kill an enemy, he usually shoots out half of the magazine during death animation, so if you're close - you're dead. If enemy can't be staggered or oneshot, it will hit you due to high accuracy on high difficulty and you can't prevent that.
- Enemies are bullet sponges. They require 4 headshots from a nailgun, holy hell.
- 3 weapon slots are too little for the variety and varying rarity of the weapons."

49,4,0.7671,"enemy, weapon, take, also, feel, gun, make, thing, time, even","Note: I don't play online/multiplayer, so this review is only based on the single player game.

This is one of the few games I'll reinstall every year to play thru. 8/10.

AI - Pretty good. AI won't rush into your line of sight, will attempt to flush you out with grenades, will attempt to flank you) which gives a nice challenge. Unfortunately you can hear their chatter, and it will clue you in on what they are going to do.

Weapons - You can only carry 3 weapons along with 3 types of throwable explosives. There aren't many sniper type weapons in the game unless you consider the Penetrator as one, but you won't have many large areas where it would advantageous. A few of the heavier weapons you won't find much ammo for, but all the weapons are useful. Even duel-wielding pistols is usable throughout the game if you can keep finding ammo for it.

Level Design - If there's anything I would mark this game down for, it's the linear design. There's only one way to go, with no real multiple paths. Sure sometimes you can go thru a window to get into a room rather than the door, and sometimes a hallway goes around a set of cubicles, but that's about it when it comes to choices. As the game takes place in poorly lit corridors for the most part, and a lot of it looks the same, you can get turned around from time to time when needing to backtrack thru an area.

Atmosphere - The games does quite good in instilling a creepy vibe. Sometimes you'll see something walking by out of the corner of your view, turn around and it disappears. The developers did a pretty good job with that.

If you have difficulties playing this game the first time, don't forget to use your SlowMo. I find it's best to hide behind cover, glance to see if your target is just in view, then hit SlowMo and come out guns blazing. Unless you see another enemy there, turn off SlowMo while running back to cover. It's hard to play this game as a stealth game. You can sneak up and knock someone out, but usually that will alert the others in the area."
