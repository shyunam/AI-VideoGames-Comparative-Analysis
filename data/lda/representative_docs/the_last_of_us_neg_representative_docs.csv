These are my thoughts but I did use ChatGPT to format and enhance them.

In reflecting on its esteemed launch, ""The Last of Us Part 1"" initially presents itself as a seminal entry into the survival-horror genre. However, revisiting the game in March 2024, I find myself grappling with a mixture of admiration and disappointment.

[h2]The Highlights: Story and Environment[/h2]

At its core, ""The Last of Us"" shines through its narrative and the beautifully desolate world it paints. The game masterfully crafts a post-apocalyptic environment teeming with detail and atmosphere, serving as the backdrop to a story that remains compelling despite its age. The concept of survival is not only a theme but a mechanic, though it's here my enthusiasm wanes.

[h2]Diving Deeper:[/h2]

[h3]Gameplay Dynamics:[/h3]

The crux of my critique lies in the gameplay. Spanning approximately 13 hours, the journey felt more like a chore than an adventure. As a player, you're thrust into a world ravaged by the infected and hostile humans, with the options to approach situations with stealth or aggression (""Rambo style""). The stealth mechanic, ostensibly a key gameplay element, proves tedious, often feeling like it sets you up for failure unless an inordinate amount of effort is invested in perfecting it. This repetitiveness quickly wears thin.

The game's upgrade system paradoxically muddles its intended gameplay dynamics. While weapon enhancements are readily accessible, encouraging a more confrontational, action-packed approach, the stark contrast arises with the [b]stealth and character-based upgrades[/b]. These crucial enhancements, pivotal for those preferring a stealthy playstyle, require a hefty resource investment, rendering them nearly out of reach until the game's later stages.

This imbalance not only hampers the feasibility of consistent stealth gameplay but also introduces a dissonance with the game's thematic essence. While cutscenes might glorify the player's prowess, suggesting a narrative of dominance, the gameplay mechanics, particularly the prohibitive cost of [b]stealth and character upgrades[/b], significantly lean towards vulnerability and survival.

Such a discrepancy between the narrative’s portrayal of the character and the actual gameplay experience, accentuated by an upgrade system that disproportionately favors aggression over stealth, [b]dilutes the game's overarching survival theme[/b], presenting a jarring inconsistency that detracts from the cohesion of the experience.

[h3]Narrative Engagement:[/h3]

The story, while good, falls short of greatness. Its linear progression feels outdated in 2024, a time when player choice and narrative branching have become standard in story-driven games. This lack of player agency diminishes the personal connection to the narrative, a stark contrast to games like ""The Witcher 3,"" where choices significantly impact the storyline. Incorporating choice in the PC remake could have refreshed the game for contemporary audiences without detracting from its core narrative.

[h3]Environmental Design:[/h3]

The game's environment remains a high point, meticulously crafted and immersive. It sets a compelling stage for the story, though further commentary risks nitpicking at what is generally an impressive aspect of the game.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]

In sum, ""The Last of Us Part 1"" stands as a testament to the potential of storytelling and environmental design in video games. However, its gameplay mechanics and lack of player agency, especially when viewed through the lens of 2024, highlight missed opportunities for innovation and refinement in its PC iteration. While it retains its place in the annals of video game history, one can't help but feel that this relic of the past could have been so much more with just a few modern enhancements.

The realm of narrative-driven video games is replete with tales of grandeur, and ""The Last of Us"" stood as a shining example of such magnificence. Thus, it's with a heavy heart that one must navigate the murky waters of its sequel, ""The Last of Us Part II.""

From the outset, the game's tone feels disjointed. Where the original painted a poignant picture of humanity's struggle and the lengths one might go to protect loved ones, Part II meanders, oscillating between half-realized themes and tonal inconsistencies. The gravity of Ellie's journey, so deeply personal in its intent, is often lost amidst the cacophony of secondary narratives that add little to the overarching tale.

Visually, while the world of ""The Last of Us Part II"" boasts intricate details, there's a palpable absence of soul. Environments, though technically marvelous, lack the atmospheric tension that once made every corner turned a potential threat. This sterility permeates even the character models, rendering emotional sequences somewhat hollow.

The game's narrative decisions remain its most contentious aspect. Characters, once beloved, are offered up on the altar of shock value, their arcs concluding in ways that feel unearned and, at times, gratuitous. This penchant for subversion, rather than adding layers, often detracts from the emotional heft of the storyline.

Gameplay, a potential saving grace, also falters. Combat scenarios, though more varied, often descend into repetition, lacking the strategic depth of the original. Stealth, a staple of the series, feels more forced than ever, with AI patterns that seem predictable rather than intuitive.

In sum, ""The Last of Us Part II"" stands as a shadow of its predecessor. Despite its technical prowess and moments of genuine emotional depth, the game feels like a disjointed tapestry of missed opportunities. One can't help but yearn for the nuanced storytelling and immersive world-building of the original."

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

The Last of Us Part 2 is a prime example **** that prioritizes pushing a supposed ""LGBT agenda"" over delivering a compelling and enjoyable experience. This sequel is marred by heavy-handed and forced attempts at inclusivity, overshadowing any potential for a well-crafted story and engaging gameplay.

Rather than focusing on the characters and their development, the game seems more interested in hammering its progressive messaging into the player's consciousness. The inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters feels contrived and unnecessary, as their sexual orientation becomes their defining trait rather than an aspect of their identity. The narrative sacrifices depth and coherence to virtue signal, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying storyline.

Unfortunately, this obsession with inclusivity negatively impacts the gameplay as well. The forced diversity feels more like tokenism, with the game's agenda taking precedence over meaningful gameplay mechanics. It's clear that the developers prioritized their message over creating a polished and enjoyable gaming experience.

In addition to the narrative shortcomings, the gameplay itself is riddled with flaws. The combat encounters lack innovation and fail to offer any real challenge, while the stealth mechanics feel clunky and unrefined. The pacing is uneven, with stretches of repetitive gameplay that make the experience monotonous and tedious.

Furthermore, technical issues plague the game, with frequent frame rate drops and glitches that disrupt immersion and undermine the overall experience. It's disheartening to see a game of this magnitude released with such significant technical shortcomings.

Ultimately, The Last of Us Part 2's preoccupation with pushing an ""LGBT agenda"" at the expense of a well-crafted narrative and enjoyable gameplay is a disservice to the potential of the franchise. Instead of embracing diversity in a meaningful way, the game comes across as pandering and lacks the substance that made its predecessor so memorable. It's a missed opportunity and a disappointing addition to the series ."

The Last of Us Part 1, often hailed as a masterpiece by critics and fans alike, left me profoundly disappointed and questioning the overwhelming praise it has received. While it undoubtedly has its strengths, I found several aspects of the game that left me frustrated and underwhelmed.

First and foremost, the gameplay in The Last of Us Part 1 falls short of its potential. The combat mechanics are clunky, making it a chore to engage in gunfights or melee encounters. The scarcity of ammunition and resources often leads to unnecessary frustration, as the game forces players into situations where they must resort to trial-and-error tactics rather than strategic gameplay.

The AI of both enemy and companion characters is often erratic and inconsistent. Enemies display unrealistic levels of awareness at times, making stealth an unreliable option. Conversely, your AI companions can frequently be a hindrance rather than an asset, failing to react intelligently to the danger around them and compromising your efforts to progress.

While the story of The Last of Us Part 1 is praised for its emotional depth and character development, I found it to be predictable and clichéd. The post-apocalyptic setting, overrun by a zombie-like infection, feels tired and unoriginal, lacking the fresh perspective that could have set it apart from similar narratives in the genre. Furthermore, the character of Joel, often touted as a complex anti-hero, comes across as one-dimensional and unsympathetic for much of the game.

The pacing is another significant issue. The game's narrative is often disrupted by extended sections of mundane and repetitive gameplay, such as moving ladders or planks to progress. These segments only serve to pad out the game's length without adding meaningful content or excitement.


In summary, The Last of Us Part 1 is a game that I found to be overhyped and ultimately underwhelming. Its gameplay frustrations, inconsistent AI, unoriginal storytelling. While it may have resonated with many players, I couldn't help but feel let down by the immense acclaim surrounding this title."

It's a colossal disappointment that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. This sequel is a perfect example of how not to continue a beloved franchise.First and foremost, the story is an absolute trainwreck. It's convoluted, poorly paced, and filled with unnecessary twists and turns that only serve to confuse and frustrate players. The narrative decisions made by the developers seem like they were chosen purely for shock value rather than for the sake of meaningful storytelling. The characters we grew to love in the first game are mishandled and their arcs are completely undermined, leaving players feeling detached and uninvested.Speaking of characters, the new additions to the cast are equally disappointing. Ellie, the strong and relatable protagonist from the original game, is reduced to a one-dimensional revenge-driven character with questionable decision-making skills. The game tries to force players into empathizing with her, but it's hard to sympathize when her actions become increasingly irrational and out of **** gameplay, while solid in the first game, feels clunky and uninspired here. The stealth mechanics are frustratingly inconsistent, often leading to cheap deaths and repetitive encounters. The level design lacks creativity and fails to offer any real sense of exploration. It's a far cry from the immersive and engaging gameplay experience we had in the first **** aspect that cannot be ignored is the game's heavy-handed political agenda. The Last of Us Part II seems more interested in pushing a specific message than in delivering an enjoyable gaming experience. The themes of revenge, violence, and LGBTQ+ representation are forced upon the players, overshadowing any potential for genuine emotional **** top of all these flaws, the technical issues are abundant. The game suffers from frequent frame rate drops, long loading times, and numerous glitches that break immersion and hinder gameplay. It's astonishing that a game of this magnitude could be released with such glaring technical **** conclusion, The Last of Us Part II is a soulless cash grab that tarnishes the legacy of its predecessor. It fails to capture the essence of what made the original game so special and instead delivers a mess of a story, uninspired gameplay, and technical problems. Fans of the first game will be left feeling betrayed, and newcomers will be left wondering what all the hype was about. Save your time and money—this sequel is a disgrace."

I do hope this epistle finds you in good health and high spirits. It is with great pleasure that I impart a recent discovery that hath occupied much of my leisure. A game titled ""The Last of Us"" hath been procured on Steam.

I confess, this game is unlike any I have beheld before. It is situated in a world devastated by a fungal infestation, and the remnant survivors must fight for their very existence against infected humans and other perilous adversaries.

The game possesses an incredible sense of realism, with breathtaking graphics and sounds that ring true. I find myself completely absorbed in this wondrous world, and oftentimes I lose track of time whilst indulging.

Verily, some may view such indulgences as trivial, but I implore thee to remember that leisure and respite are essential, even amidst the flurry of our daily lives. Additionally, I have found that games, like ""The Last of Us,"" doth enhance my faculties, improving my analytical skills and logical reasoning.

I pray this missive finds thee in good stead, and I earnestly hope that thou art likewise enjoying thyself during these distressing times. Do write back and inform me of thy welfare and wellbeing.

It is a boring, linear, and predictable story that forces you to play as a grumpy old man who has to escort a bratty teenage girl across a zombie-infested America. The gameplay is repetitive, the stealth is frustrating, and the combat is clunky. The graphics are decent, but the animations are stiff and the facial expressions are unnatural. The voice acting is overrated, the dialogue is cheesy, and the characters are unlikable. The game is full of clichés, plot holes, and moral dilemmas that are neither original nor meaningful.
