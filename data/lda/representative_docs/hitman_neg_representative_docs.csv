Dude what am I missing about the Hitman games they are so boring. You walk around slowly until you find what to press on and then you press on it or pick it up and move it and then keep walking around until you find the next thing to interact with. The things that are fun I considered a failure if you get to a gunfight you get less points and stuff. Who is this game for seven year old people that don't like fun and excitement it's so boring"
1,0,0.932,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I've loved the hitman series but this game only take 8 hours to play through and the story was subpar. The cinematic sequences were done well enough but there were only a few dozen of them. I don't know maybe i just played the game wrong but i don't like the idea of replaying missions. This felt like hitman but it lacked substance and really... I feel disappointed in the franchise. They took a different angle and really punish the act of killing and almost make you feel bad about it. Which is fine but, they have just narrowed down how the game is supposed to be played."

Stealth felt kind of boring, There are some pre-made opportunities to be used to get down targets, you can also replay missions plenty of time if you want to try different way of eliminating targets. The point is get there, find a way to kill target, and repeat and again and again. I kind of wish this would be first person shooter instead of stealth game. Also I finished game in around 9 hours meh meh (without replaying any missions as I just hard pushed myself to finish the bloody thing asap). For me its big no no, there are much better stealth games like dishonored etc."

4,0,0.8935,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I wish i could give this 'matter of preference' instead of 'not recommended' :/

Idea of the game is great, silent assassin ordered to kill some targets. It's cool concept and i really wanted to like this. Unfortunately the way this game works is through trial and error, save & reload pattern. Everything is about exploring every room, every important guest, being patient and tactical... except its just an illusion.

 I personally cannot proceed through the missions with the sense of accomplishment or satisfaction simply because the only way to actually accomplish the mission in stealth is by learning patterns of guards and wintesses, learning exactly where target is going go to, what glass they're going to drink from and so on. By the time you learn that, targets already script-walked through all the places where assassination could take place and only thing you can do is reload back to mission start and prepare your assassination based on the knowledge from previous exploring... As if Hitman was supposed to be psychic, able to see into the future of what the target is going to be doing next or where it's going to stand during the next 5 seconds.

For me, this kind of observe & reload based gameplay simply does not give me the feeling of accomplishment i would expect from a game like this, because i basically just saved & reloaded bunch of times until something worked. I understand the appeal for those who like it tho, replayability and searching for many different ways to complete the mission can be lots of fun -> This is just a note for potential new players about what to expect out of this game."
5,0,0.8933,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I'm a big fan of the Hitman series; I have almost 200 hours in Absolution and about 100 in Blood Money. This Hitman doesn't live up to either one.

In Absolution, we lost the more tactical game that Blood Money provided. Absolution was very cinematic, but I found it a little hard to adjust at first. This game goes back to the Blood Money style, so if you like that, then that's a positive.

However, this game was incredibly short. I completed it in about 8 hours, and that was taking my time. The AI don't seem to be very smart, the look and feel is nowhere near Absolution, and I found the progression system annoying. In order to play a contract on a harder difficulty or use various weapons or locations, you have to have already beaten the mission several times. I like my first playthrough to be the way I want to play, so I found that frustrating.

The ESP instinct felt way overpowered, as you could see your targets through walls from across the map. Granted, you can turn in completely off, but you can't turn it down.

A lot of the gameplay mechanics, like getting frisked, seem to be things that were added last minute. You can conceal weapons in trash cans to avoid them being dectected in a frisk, but, in my playthrough, I got frisked all of one time. A lot of mechanics feel this way where they go largely unutilized.

Unfortunantly, this game just makes me want to play Blood Money."
6,0,0.8904,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target",You have to really really like stealth games to enjoy this. You spend a ton of time standing around studying npc's pathing around the map to figure out puzzles that don't leave you feeling like you accomplished anything.
7,0,0.8846,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","It looks really good, and the maps are nice. But it only takes a couple hours to figure out that you are not playing a simulation. And by that I mean you either follow the script and trigger the kill correctly or the game just throws NPC's at you until you are dead. In theory you are supposed to be able to be stealthy, but anyone you kill off-script gets known by all the NPC's even though no one saw you do it. The game wasn't for me. I got assured it was free form, but it's really not. You just have several options that make it a bit more open. But you are still kept basically on a rail by the game."
8,0,0.8828,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","DO NOT BUY HITMAN! IT'S AWFUL.

One would think with levels that are absolutely massive in size, NPCs everywhere, and at least  6 or 7 different scripted quest chains for taking out targets, there should be limitless options for the player, right? Well, wrong. First of all, note that I use the word scripted. None of those different methods of taking out targets are actually achieved by the player. Rather, the game has various ""opportunities,"" as they call it, whereby it will tell you exactly where to go and what to do there, usually involving standing still and listening to a painfully long and boring conversation (more on this later), before beating up (or killing if you prefer) a civilian and stealing his/her costume. With that costume on, some types of NPCs, those wearing other costumes, will generally let you pass, whereas those of the same costume sometimes recognize you're not one of them. Anyway, these opportunities deprive the player of freedom, because you never actually do any of the steps yourself. There is no fun in playing a game where you blindly repeat what a walkthrough tells you to do.

But, you can turn the opportunities off. Okay, fine, so try that out. However, the levels are so ridiculously massive and any one small mistake will trigger the ai to come and kill you, that the game punishes you for trying out anything. I can't tell you how many times I spent probably 30-40 minutes or over an hour on a single level, executing everything flawlessly, only for one idiot guard to recognize me when he shouldn't have, and now all my time was wasted.

Wasted, because the game won't let you save. On the professional difficulty, you literally have just one save, so that involves a ridiculous amount of blind repetition till you figure out just how to game the system and trick the poorly programmed ai (or of course just read how to do it online, which is what most people do, but again, there's no fun in copying a walkthrough). But even on the lower difficulty, the game won't let you save if you're in combat, which since you're about to die would probably be the one time you want to save the most. There are ""autosaves,"" but the game doesn't autosave after killing a target. You would think achieving the primary objective would grant you a save, but no. However you choose to play, there's no getting around the fact that you'll keep getting frustrated, losing a lot of progress, and having to repeat it all over again till you get just a tiny bit further by figuring out how to abuse the ai.

So, inevitably, I get so sick of putting up with all of this bullshit that I say, fuck it, I'm just going to go and play this like an action game, i.e. guns ablazing, kill 'em all! That doesn't work either, because you have next to no health (and especially on professional one hit kills you), and there's endless waves after waves of guards. Of course, the a.i. are so poorly programmed that you can hide in one spot behind cover and they won't even shoot at you, yet even dropping hundreds upon hundreds of bodies, the game won't save or let you save because you're in ""combat"" mode.

So, to recap, you are punished for exploring and experimenting in this world because any slight mistake will send waves of enemies after you and/or undo a lot of your time and progress up to that point. You are forced to game the system or blindly follow the scripted events the way the game tells you to, or read how to do it online. And you can't even just run in and shoot 'em all, because apart from the tutorial level and the sapienza (Spain) level, that won't work.

Even if you remove your brain and blindly follow the opportunities as told, most of the gameplay involves standing around for minutes on end, either waiting for the a.i. to walk to the right position, or waiting for a lengthy conversation to finish. This is intolerably bad because there's about 3 or 4 voice actors in the entire game, and the only way I can adequately describe their voices is they sound bitchy. That uptight, holier-than-thou, upper class sound. The kind of people who whine about the first world of first world problems. And no matter where you are in the world--Japan, Thailand, France, the Middle East, etc.--they will always speak in the same American and British accents. This is massively immersion breaking. Hell, even in the level set in America, they don't sound like who they're supposed to be (terrorists). The voice acting, and the dialogue the actors recite, is simply horrendous, and you can't play the game well until you've heard every piece of dialogue so many times that you know what they'll say before they say it. 

Speaking of immersion breaking, none of the ""characters"" behave like real people. They are like a roller coaster on rails. They are programmed to walk from point A, to point B, and perhaps to point C. Rinse and repeat. Many times you will listen to a conversation, and not only will the dialog repeat after finishing, which is understandable in a game, but the action of the NPC itself will repeat, where he finishes talking and gets up, only to sit right back down and say the same line again. The head administrator of a hospital is never in his office, where you'd think he'd be working, because he's only programmed to walk into the garden and restaurant. If a target's point C is to sit down at a table,  no other NPC will occupy that table once he leaves, because your target is programmed to come back there, and that's not possible if somebody else has taken his seat. This is part of the reason I say ""playing the game"" is just gaming the system or abusing the a.i. mechanics. You have to memorize where each NPC will be (because it's exactly the same every playthrough), by endless repetition, and try to trick the a.i.. I don't feel like I'm some badass killer evading enemies' notice; even when I do succeed it's only by abusing just how broken the a.i. are.

The enemy guards in this game are like the enemies in the first (and by far worst) Assassin's Creed game. If you accidentally bump into them while walking, they want to kill you. If you so much as look at them the wrong way, they'll come at you. There is little predictability to what you must to do in order to trigger the enemies' coming after you. Anything and everything you do leads to being chased by guards (and sooner or later failing the mission), which is why I said the game punishes exploration and experimentation.

Believe it or not, the ""opportunities"" (in-game walkthroughs) are not the only form of cheating the game encourages. Batman Arkham games have detective mode. Assassin's Creed has eagle eye vision. Hitman has a similar mode called ""Instinct,"" which lets you see through walls. This is so broken that I actually completed the Colorado mission just by sniping all my targets from across the map, often when they were obscured behind objects. Realistically, no one can look through walls, and you're just an ordinary human, so this feels like cheating. The game also tells you which NPC's can recognize you through the disguise, and their location appears on map, as does the target. Again, this feels like cheating because realistically, how would Hitman know magically where the enemy is at all times? Or if there's a guard behind a wall I've never gone past before? Other games usually show maps for areas you've been to, not before you've been there, or if they do, it won't tell you where enemies are. But like other cheats, the game wasn't intended to be played with them turned off, so doing so will only make your experience more of a living hell.

Finally, the maps are way too large. This may seem good as there's only 6 in the entire game, each of which are intended to be repeated numerous times, but it's not. It just means that each map takes hours (not hyperbole) to finish, you miss out on most of the level's content each time (you can only kill a man once even if there's 10 different ways), and there's many more ways to fail"
9,0,0.8799,"level, way, feel, mission, map, time, make, kill, blood, target","I really wanted to like this. The levels are huge and amazingly detailed and the kill opportunities are very creative. But the AI is just so damn buggy, unless you follow the scripted ""opportunities"" in which you perform actions in sequence to kill the targets via methods like tricking them into killing each other or having an accident with sabotaged equipment, then the game really falls apart. Every other time you take down a guard the others will psychically know what you did even if there are no witnesses. You can shoot someone in the head with a silenced pistol from a position where only the target had a clear line of sight although their back was turned to you, and so long as someone saw the person die then even if they didnt have a clear line of sight to you they will instantly know where you are and what disguise you are wearing

In short, this is meant to be played out like an adventure game. The game points out the line you have to follow to make the scripted deaths occur and if you try to step off the line it has drawn for you the whole thing falls apart because the AI is severely buggy and the scripted kills were designed to hide it"

49,4,0.8801,"release, mission, buy, full, wait, content, episode, pay, money, go",It's a really good game loved it. But there is one thing i hated and it's this episode system you dont buy the game you buy episodes. I want full access if i buy a game like Hitman: Absolution. It is still the best Hitman game and if IO Interactive keeps on going this way there won't be any better Hitman games. About the story: it's not that bad it's ok they could do better but just like i said buying episodes system is the thing i hated in this game.
