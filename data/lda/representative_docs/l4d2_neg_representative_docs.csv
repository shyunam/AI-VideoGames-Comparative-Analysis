-pistols are pure garbage (to under powered)
-melee weapons feels overpowered
-more woke then first part

+have workshop
+mutators
All this just could be added to the first part as expansion pack."

3,0,0.8593,"fun, server, zombie, friend, want, really, first, well, bad, feel","Unpopular opinion maybe? I don't like this game at all. Every zombie stuns you. That's not fun. Every gun feels really bad to shoot; there's practically no feedback when hitting zombies. That's not fun. The special infected, with the exception of the Witch, feel bad to play around (mostly due to their abilities just being an extra long stun). The maps being the same every time means if you don't play this game to the point of having the layouts memorized, you're going to get lost while your friends leave you behind. I acknowledge this is a literal skill issue... but it's still not fun.

I give this game and its predecessor all the credit in the world for basically kick-starting the wave shooter genre (which gave us Deep Rock Galactic), but I feel like the concept has since been improved upon to such a degree that I find this game borderline unplayable now."
4,0,0.8502,"fun, server, zombie, friend, want, really, first, well, bad, feel","The official servers provided by Valve itself have been under attack by ld!0t(s) with no life for months, they are completely unplayable and Valve has been unable to solve the issue, or worse, they never tried to solve the issue of a game they still charge.
The community is full of pathetic griefers and votekicking system can be easily manipulated by anyone who thinks they are better than you.

Don't buy unless you want to play in modded third-party servers."
5,0,0.8258,"fun, server, zombie, friend, want, really, first, well, bad, feel","Get from A to B while defeating random waves of zombies. That's literally it.

Game has some interesting lore, but you won't really notice it during gameplay.

Maybe it's fun with friends, idk, I have no friends."

10,1,0.8657,"leave, dead, year_ago, uncomfortable, community, player, make, valve, toxic, old",until very recently i would not have been ablee to ate this highly enough. but recently the game has suffered from neglect in the form of server ddoses. valve has been neglecting old ips for so many years that there are whole networks of hackers riddling their games now. sad that such a masterpeice is now tarnished by this behavior
11,1,0.8139,"leave, dead, year_ago, uncomfortable, community, player, make, valve, toxic, old","The average maturity on this game is equivalent to a 5 year old.  95% of the players, now, are Spanish speaking trolls.  The other 5% are basement dwellers with over 10k hours.  Wouldn't recommend if it was free."

13,1,0.7888,"leave, dead, year_ago, uncomfortable, community, player, make, valve, toxic, old","No doubt one of the best zombie/co-op games to ever release. Easy to pick up and hard to master. However if you wanna enjoy this game, playing with friends is the best route since the toxicity of random lobbies is insane. There are good randoms out there but they are so far and few in between when playing by yourself. Racial slurs and constant kicking is what ruined this game for me. And it's not even contained to versus lobbies. Great game ruined by the an extremely divided community."
14,1,0.7748,"leave, dead, year_ago, uncomfortable, community, player, make, valve, toxic, old",it keeps getting stuck on loading screen when going to safe zones
15,1,0.7743,"leave, dead, year_ago, uncomfortable, community, player, make, valve, toxic, old","This game is a gem among Valve's infinite catalog of games, but has been ruined, just like Team Fortress 2, by cheaters who single-handedly killed this marvel among games. Valve, at the corporate level, is incompetent, lazy, ignorant, and one could even consider it truly soulless. They have learned that sticking their head into the sand and making no-assed promises are the best way to shut people up, and are capitalizing on it. I LOVE this game, maybe even more than Team Fortress 2, but has, just like TF2, been made unplayable by cheaters.

To any employee at Valve, please acknowledge the fact we love these games, and don't want to see them gone. We wish that you could get up, and do something to fix this mess of a company that relies on inaction to thrive. That's all I really can say about these games. Thank you"
16,1,0.7485,"leave, dead, year_ago, uncomfortable, community, player, make, valve, toxic, old",ngl this is the saddest form of toxicity ever lol. met some guy who literally used keybinds to slur in chat.
17,1,0.7477,"leave, dead, year_ago, uncomfortable, community, player, make, valve, toxic, old","Valve, enough is enough. Please fix this game, and the rest of your catalog. Hackers ruining the experience is one horrible thing, but those bot hosters have proved to be dangerous and unhinged individuals. When community members finally tried to do your work for you, they have been doxed, impersonated, threatened, and even swatted. I don't care if we never get a content update again, or even that new game ya'll have been cooking up, the already existing playerbases for team fortress 2, counter strike 2, and left for dead 2 deserve better. And they certainly deserve more than a tweet saying you hear them. You did not. It breaks my heart to say all this, but your inaction to keep your customers safe has lead us to this moment. If by some miracle this gets fixed, I will happily change this review."

41,4,0.9158,"coach, skin, brown, cleveland, dissaapoinrtwd, sex, suck, cancer, minute, bot","Impressively bad. Instead of playing this, spend your time making this great cheesecake

Crust:
8 whole graham crackers, broken into 1-inch pieces
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled. Plus 1 extra tablespoon butter for brushing on pan
3 tablespoons sugar
Filling:
2 1/2 pounds cream cheese, cut into chunks and softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 large egg yolks
6 large eggs

For the crust: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325°. Process the graham cracker pieces in a food processor to fine, even crumbs, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle the melted butter and sugar over the crumbs and pulse to incorporate. Sprinkle the mixture into a 9-inch springform pan. Press the crumbs firmly into an even layer using the bottom of a measuring cup. Bake the crust until fragrant and beginning to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let the crust cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

For the filling: Meanwhile, increase the oven temperature to 500°. Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until smooth, 1-3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and beaters as necessary.

Beat in half the sugar and salt until incorporated, 1-3 minutes. Beat in the remaining sugar until incorporated, 1-3 minutes. Beat in the sour cream, lemon juice and vanilla until incorporated, 1-3 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks and eggs, two at a time until combined, 1-3 minutes.

Being careful not to disturb the baked crust, brush the inside of the prepared springform pan with 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Set the pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Carefully pour the filling into the pan. Bake the cheesecake for 10 minutes.

Without opening the door, reduce the oven temperature to 200° and continue to bake the cheesecake until the center of the cake registers 150° (about 1 1/2 hours).

Transfer the cake to a wire rack and run a knife around the edge of the cake. Let the cheesecake stand until just barely warm, 2 1/2 – 3 hours. Chill until ready to eat. Serve as is or with Strawberry Topping.
