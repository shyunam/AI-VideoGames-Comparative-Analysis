11,1,0.9587,"alien, go, make, find, time, see, thing, way, hide, kill","I knew it was nearby. That... creature.

I hid in the vents, hoping that it would pass me by. I found a small nook, just a bit off of the main vent passage, and hide there. I could hear it moving. Then i hear the vent entrance open.

It was in there with me.

I prayed to whatever being might listen. To God. To Buddah. To C'thulu, on the off chance it might summon the beast back to wherever it had been summoned from.

I see it move up to the entrance to my little haven... and then past me. I hear the vent door on the far end open. I guess one of those beings must have heard me.

I move out into the main vent area...

And learn which deity responded to my pleas. There it was, waiting for me. It tricked me.

Dang it, C'thulu."

Suddenly it moves away. you take a deep breath and exit the locker. You run ten feet and dive under a desk. You wait a minute. Coast seems clear. You slowly creep out from under the desk. THE AILEN DROPS OUT OF THE CEILING RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU DIVE BACK UNDER THE DESK ONLY A SPLIT SECOND BEFORE IT TURNS AROUND. It stalks around the room with heavy foot falls. Your heart is pounding. You creep back out. Look around. It is gone. You creep to the door. You open it. Nothing there. the hallway is clear. You move down the hall. There is nothing in the hall you can hide in. Oh no you went the wrong way. You turn around and the alien drops down several yards away. NO WHERE TO HIDE! You prey it doesn't turn around. If it turns it will see you. If it sees you it will kill you...buy the game to find out what happens next.

15,1,0.9185,"alien, go, make, find, time, see, thing, way, hide, kill","I was hiding from the alien and trying to get a door unlocked. I'd already got the code from the terminal so now it was just a matter of getting the code to the door. I managed to make my way to the door without being spotted by the alien, however like an idiot i forgot the door code.

I thought to myself ""No problem, it's not too far to the terminal and it was easy enough getting here"" so i made my way back to the terminal. I got to the terminal intact and got the code and began repeating it in my head over and over again... ""1702, 1702"" i kept saying. I looked round the corner and the alien was snooping around the path i'd came from, so to get back to the door i had to take the longer route.

I slowly made my way round, crouching near a wall. There was a window looking into a room so i decided to peak in to check on the alien. It was just standing there looking around so i made my way towards a table to hide under until the alien moved away from that room...
I got next to the table and was about ready to crawl under it when the alien suddenly came running round the corner and killed me.

Pants were filled.

10/10 Great game to show your nan."
