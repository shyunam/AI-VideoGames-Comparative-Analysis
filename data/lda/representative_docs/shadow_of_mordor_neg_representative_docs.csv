Dis game iz terribul.

Yoo play az a dum zoggin' humie git who'ze fam'ly gets fragged to zog (by UVVER HUMIES might I add), an' den insted'a killin' da gitz wot fragged 'im, 'e goes on a murderin' rampage killin' every ork dat moovs.

Dat's da whole game. Yoo just walk round an' kill orkz, mosta which iz just mindin' dey own bizness or iz defendin' demselves. Dat'z da hole storee. Dere'z even a sneaky-git-type ork dat helpz you kill da uvver orkz so 'e can be da boss, but after 'e helpz yoo, 'e getz zogged by anuvver humie. Servez 'im right fer helpin' ork-murderin' humiez, but still...

I played dis game fer lotsa minnits an' hours n' such, figurin' dat since it was wun a dose ""Sassin'z Kreed""-type gamez dat dis wuz just da tutorial, an' da game wud open up more az it introdoosed more intrakit gameplay mekaniks, but wut happened next made me kwit da game. Yoo see, after da first haff o' da game, yoo get da power not just ta kill orkz, but to ENSLAVE dem! Dat'z rite! Yoo use dum zoggin' pointy-eared majiks ta make orks fink dat humiez iz better den orkz and dat dis humie is dere warboss. Dat ain't rite!

An' da orkz in dis game ain't even green! Dat'z unrealistik! Klearly dey didn't have any orkz on da game design teem. Dey'z all even voised by da same humie, doin' a reelly bad ork accent! Dat'z not what orkz sound like! Dey sound like dis: WAAAAAAAGH!!!

So yeah. Dis game iz terribul, unrealistik, an' rasist 'gainst orkz. Don't buy it."

30,3,0.9504,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Pros

+ Great graphics, sound, etc.

+ Anything set in the LOTR universe is interesting.

+ Satisfying gameplay. Movement and combat is fluid, responsive and rewarding.

Cons

- One of the most repetitive games ever made.

- Combat is too easy and it's really easy to find exploits.

- The nemesis system is cool at first, but ultimately extremely repetitive and shallow.

- boring open world, with nothing to do.

- recycled secondary missions, and no secondary quests.

- Lack of variety of enemy types.

- Zero customization. You can't change armor, clothing, weapons etc. nothing.

- Short campaign.

- Bad, boring, repetitive and unoriginal story and quests.

- lack of content, the price doesn't reflect what you get.

- Shallow and easy stealth system.

- No platforming challenges or puzzles, although Assassin's Creed style parkour is a core mechanic.

31,3,0.9359,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","I was promised interesting gameplay by my friends for this game. I thought the nemesis system would be a cool idea. It was good at first, but it got boring. Honestly I thought this game was pretty repetitive and boring. The story is not very good and the missions are extremely repetitive like I said. I did not like the abscense of towns and other interesting locations. The large map wasn't utilized very well. I didn't really feel anything for the 2 main characters they were pretty bland. The graphics were good, but uninsprired. The orc character designs were well done. Hopefully the next game will build on the postives, create a better story, and more intersting missions. 6/10"
32,3,0.9321,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Honestly it just felt like an assassin's creed copy. The story was really short and after I beat the game it got even more boring and repetitive. Though the story was good, the rest of the game is rather bland. The main quests felt like simple side quest. Combat was also repetitive. After awhile, after you beat the game it's just really boring...."
33,3,0.9259,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Got the game as a fan of Middle-Earth and because of all the positive reviews here.  I'm fairly disappointed.  It is basically an Assassin's Creed ripoff in Middle-Earth.  It's not a terrible game.  The gameplay is fun at some times and boring at others.  The graphics and cinematics are decent.  Yes, the game is old at this point, but I haven't played a bunch of games of this style, so I'm not disappointed due to it being an older game.  It just isn't particularly compelling.  The characters don't make me feel any attachment to them.  The open-world nature of the game is fairly pointless since there isn't enough meaningful content to make you feel like you are actually making choices.  You are just following the story.  And the story isn't really bad, but the story and characters just aren't that compelling.  If another character connected to the main character dies, it doesn't feel meaningful the way it should in an immersive game.  Good voice acting most of the time, although the voice acting of the orcs feels a bit off.  Can't see myself ever putting more than the ~20 hours that I spent finishing the main story.  There are other modes, but after finishing the main story I don't feel much desire to explore them.

Overall, it's not a bad game, but the recommendations on here are heavily in favor of it.  I think the game is pretty average, thus the negative review relative to what everyone else seems to have given."
34,3,0.9255,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","It's a generic open world power fantasy adventure, Arkham asylum meets Assasins Creed. If that sounds amazing you'll probably love this game. The focus is on looking cool and staying safe rather than providing a challenge and as such quicly becomes repetive. The nemises system is intially pretty interesting but after several mini-boss fights and their token line of dialouge that also gets old fast. 

Honestly, this game would probably fare much better in a different or original setting as it butchers Tolkiens world. All of it is wrong both the fiction and the  themes. If you are familar with the setting, you will find yourself astounded at how tone deaf the writing department is. At best its very best its derivative and feels like a teen fan GURPS campaign.

5/10"
35,3,0.9222,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","The combat is great, other than that is either a meh or perhaps even disappointing. The game just feels too shallow. Had fun with the combat gameplay for the first few hours, but it gets repetitive. The story so far isn't really good either in my opinion. This game is probably a 5.5/10 so far, and of course that's not really bad, but I can't really recommend it"
36,3,0.9161,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","It's actually such a mid game, don't understand the hype, another ubisoft-like collectathon with one unique mechanic that gets old quick. Bland enviroment, poor colours, boring story, paperthin combat and has mechanics from other games that just makes you want to play them. Both main dlc is just the main story re skinned and way shorter, each can be done in under 3 hours"
37,3,0.9123,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","dull, weak story,  very repetitious. The novelty of the nemsis system wears off quick. The lore is interesting but feels like Tolkien fan ficition.

neat concept

mediocore combat in the vein of the Arkham series"
38,3,0.91,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","The nemesis system is undoubtedly pretty cool but unfortunately everything else feels like your run-of-the-mill open-world Ubisoft game with a 'Lord of the Rings' skin over it. 

Games like this make me wish Steam would allow me to place a 'neutral' review recommendation. It's not actually a bad game but it's mind-numbingly repetitive."
39,3,0.909,"story, feel, really, system, combat, fun, much, thing, hour, well","Incredibly short lived, and repetitive. The 'nemesis system' is completely over-rated, and the orcs forgettable to the point where if you actually manage to let one get away you will wonder what he is cursing at you for. 

I enjoyed the bits of lore and the first few hours of cutting orcs to pieces etcera, but it gets old quick. Best to get this one on sale."

48,4,0.8176,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","This game has a huge flaw and it's that the combat is terrible.  There's way too many enemies that attack you all at the same time, and you can only attack one enemy at one time.  I don't understand why they made so many enemies, and don't give you a single attack that hits multiple enemies.  It doesn't feel fun to play at all because the combat holds you back so much.  It doesn't make sense that enemies only will die from finisher attacks, but the finisher attacks take so long to execute, that if you get interrupted, the enemy just comes back to full health.  I don't understand why there isn't a fast execution attack.  The game is so frustratingly designed, I can't recommend anyone play this game."
49,4,0.8135,"kill, enemy, fight, time, captain, boss, attack, die, mission, orcs","This game is trash. The fighting is fun and all but there are certain missions where you are supposed to kill a captain, you start the mission, take out his bodyguards (bonus objective) start the fight against him and an endless amount of enemies keeps respawning to make your life miserable. Killing enemies takes a lot of effort and the only way to shorten the mundane hacking at an enemy till he dies can only be shortened by finishers, which can be interrupted by attacks from enemies. So when fighting a larger horde, like in said mission, you can just hack away endlessly until you are overwhelmed. Not to say that random captains can join in the fight, making you fight not only one, but sometimes 2 or 3 captains at the same time. And since it's a mission running away seems to be the opposite of what you should do. It's just not fun. It's frustrating and I would highly recommend to just stay away from this one."
