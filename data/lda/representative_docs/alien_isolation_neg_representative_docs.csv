10,1,0.9433,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","A well-crafted masterpiece... that shits the bed right at the end and then gleefully rubs your face in it. Takes pure luck to not get randomly ambushed by a Xenomorph when walking down a narrow corridor to the objective. Alien randomly drops in on you, pops up on the motion sensor with no warning and rips your face off. If you hide for too long the game will decide to kill you while it camps the objective. If it isn't busy making tight circles around the 100th or so generator you have to turn on to advance the story waiting for you."
11,1,0.9219,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","Found this incredibly boring as soon as the alien gets introduced. Gameplay goes as follows. Crouch your way into any room, hear heavy footsteps that are getting closer. Hide in the closet. The alien will always come and check the room you hid in, keep holding your breath for like a minute till the thing goes through it's ritual and eventually goes away. Attempt to crouch out of the room and hear the thing going back towards you. Get back to the locker, watch the alien sniff the room again, hold your breath, get out of the locker. 
If you've got the patience to keep doing this for however many hours this game lasts then play it.
I've got around 500 other games in my library that don't test my patience like this."

13,1,0.8791,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","The alien, a central aspect of the game, spawns randomly and searches for you randomly. This completely destroyed the game for me.
The game just turns into pure luck encounters. The first time I encountered the alien it literally spawned directly on top of (from a vent). After reloading I was soooo prepared and the alien spawned somewhere different where I did not even notice it until the next level.
The worst thing, the first time I wasn't even sloppy, the atmosphere is great and made me sneak the whole time.

After this the game was no longer the same or fun. You just watch every vent hoping it would not randomly spawn next to you again. And then a few levels later the alien spawned where I could clearly see it and I had to go. It walked back and forth, but never left.
I quit and uninstalled. Not fun at all. Also left me with the frustration of wasting the time up until this point."
14,1,0.866,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back","I wanted to like this game.  Just after the ""escape"" level in the mdeical facility, I climbed through the vents to a location with three humans.  I threw a pipe bomb at them and I accidentally overshot them a bit so they lived.  Low and behold the Alien popped out of the ceiling, practically landing on the three humans. They were asking themselve's if they saw who did it.  The three humans and the alien all standing there together like a party and the alien didn't even care about them.  The humans were still yelling and I waited just by the vent.  They all walked around the room as I watched them for about 3-4 minutes all of them running into each other.  I decided to open the vent and go back in when the alien heard it and ran after me and killedme before I made it down the vent.  The alien doesnt care about anything except for the player.  That broke way too much immersion for me."

The like half way through and its all been the same boring game play... sneak around and avoid the whatever. Thays right you have to hid from the humans, and the androids and the aleins... sigh. I have a gun but its usless. I shit an andoid 7 time and it then walked over and killed me. I Shot the alien a binch and it laughed and then instint killed me. Why do i have a power meter? As a joke cause everything can instint kill your weak stupid character. The alien behavior is also random and sometime unavoidable, its broken. One time i was in a locker and the aliens walkes up and just stood right outside, I could see it through the vent. It just stood for over a half hour till i just reloaded... again. I found myseld playing the game completely ignoring the alien, I just try to do the objectives and reload if the alien is around. Its so borring I not even going to fonosh the game. Do not waste your time. I want a refund ot so bad"

go waste ur time on something else"
18,1,0.8307,"alien, time, go, hide, see, run, walk, first, save, back",This game can be summed up in one sentence. Flip the switch to open the door so that you can flip another switch to open another door but oh wait some random issue means you now have to backtrack and start a generator. And you do this for hours on end all the while your crouching around hiding and moving through vents because there is always some enemy in the way. If you want to experieance the game just watch someone play it. Save your money.

But not being able to climb over a 3-foot tall guard rail, or hop over a 2-foot wide hole in the floor is just retarded and frustrating. Also, I know this isn't an FPS, but WHY CAN I PICK UP AMMO FROM DEFEATED ENEMIES BUT NOT THEIR GUNS?!? Another thing that pissed me off is I can't pick up objects and throw them to distract enemies. No, I have to collect random bits of detritus, craft them into a noise maker, then throw that as a distraction, but not before I unlock the blueprint."

You don't know why you died, or how to avoid dying the next time. You just die. Over and over again. If you survive, that survival is more likely a result of luck, not skill, not reason, not logic."

30,3,0.9184,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Was good in the first 6-7 hours, but it kinda lost its way from there. It took me about 20 hours to beat, but was not really enjoying it for most of that time after the first few. It was wayyyy to long than it needed to be IMO. And i think that if You feel like being scared a little but dont feel like finishing it, then it might be to your liking. Otherwise just buy it dirt cheap. Or cheap in general."
31,3,0.91,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I would like to give this a ""Mixed"" review but since Steam lacks that, ""Not Recommended"" will have to do.

Some good stuff first:
• Great graphics, they hold up well.
• Great atmosphere (first few hours).
• Responsive controls.
• Interesting narrative in the first half of the game.

What it completely fails at is maintaining a good balance between tension and cooling off time. Any horror classic or even just your average well made horror game, the loop is typically that of the atmosphere building some sense of dread, then you get monster encounters/ chases or scares and then you have your cooling off sections where you can roam around, find stuff, learn more about the story and the world, do puzzles and whatnot. That is an essential part of good horror games, at least for me.

In Isolation, either I got extremely unlucky and the xeno AI really had it out for me or that loop is entirely absent. Couldn't move anywhere without crouching or at any moderate speed or the creature and its insta-kills showed up immediately. Insta-kills, as countless poorly made horror games (mostly indies) have shown over and over again, absolutely destroy any semblance of immersion. After getting caught by it several times, I got so over it that I just turned indifferent to any kind of scares, I found myself playing your average keyhunt indie ""horror"" experience and the only reason I continued on with it was for the 100%.

Also, the game drags on incredibly hard after the first 5 hours or so. It feels like half of the game is just padding, like it should end at around half the playtime you can get with it but it just keeps going on.

For people like me that value a scary horror game over an overly stressful and even exhausting one, I would not recommend Alien: Isolation. Buy Outlast 1 or Amnesia: The Bunker instead, they are better than this game in every possible way."
32,3,0.9078,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","A great fan service for those poor alien fans having to suffer through so many bad games over the years. It actually looks and feels like the Alien world. They did a great job with that. I can see why they were so thrilled with this game.
 
Also i could see fans of outlast loving this game.

but as someone who isn't big into the Alien series, it just got kind of....boring. Pretty, interesting, and suspensful at first. but slowly i just wanted it to be more."
33,3,0.9019,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","This game is a mess. Bad ai, boring story, cheap deaths, and sluggish controls. However, the atmosphere is amazing. Beautiful graphics and art style along with lighting makes this one of the most attractive looking games I've ever played. Too bad I never want to play it again. The sound is overall good, but the spikes in stringed instruments to create tension is over the top. I had to turn my music almost completely down and even then its still overpoweringly loud and obnoxious. The noises the alien makes are also comedically loud and a mess of all sorts of sounds. I don't understand why they didn't just use the movies' alien sounds, as they borrowed plenty of others from them. Henceforth, this game is trash"
34,3,0.8916,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I'd like to give a more neutral review because it's not really negative, but I can't give it positive on my end. I suppose at the time of release this was a great game, but as someone who played it only a year ago, I found it to be very boring. The alien is predictable and the hide n seek games get old and annoying very quickly. There is absolutely nothing scary about this game, but as I have always said, there's no such thing as a scary game.

The combat is fun and the story isn't bad. I do like that much. If you're a fan of the movies or of survival horror and don't mind a lot of hide n seek with the alien, you may really love this game. Unfortunately, I got bored quickly and it wasn't enough to hold my attention for long. It's a shame because I did want to like the game. It just wasn't for me."
35,3,0.8844,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I would love to recommend this game. But alas, I cannot. The nostalgia... the beauty of the game... the look and feel... it brings by my love for the Alien movie all over again. But... since you can only avoid the alien by dying at least once, it's more trial and error than game. I felt more frustratration than anything else while playing this game. Sad really, it had so much potential."
36,3,0.8822,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I love the Alien movies, and I love stealth games.
But I'm not sure this gets what it's goin for...
The Atmosphere is amazing and the graphics are stunning, but the gameplay is so slow and honestly dull that I couldn't get very far in the story. 
"
37,3,0.8721,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","In short, if you are a fan of hardcore stealth game that does not have a good story, you will like the game. However, I am the opposite. I like stealth but Alien: Isolation takes it to another level. It is TOO hardcore for me to a point that it makes me feel like a coward. I cannot kill anything except for robots. On top of that, the story of the game sucked. As a fan of the movies, I am a little disappointed at the game. The purpose of the game felt a little pointless to me. The whole point of the game is to escape a giant space station that has a Xenomorph in it. Although this was also the point of the movie, the movie was interesting and kept me engaged with the scary atmosphere the actions. Whereas for the game, although it does a good job creating an intense atmosphere, there aren't any actions. The game makes you feel powerless against the Xenomorph and you are constantly in hiding from it. The story is also very disappointing, it is literally just fixing varies things in the space station while hiding from the Xenomorph. Even though you have weapons, you can rarely use them because every time you do, the Xenomorph will track you down and there is nothing you can do. I will say though, the design of Sevastopol is really good. It makes me feel like being in a real space station. It is really a shame because I feel like the game could actually be good if the story is more engaging. However, that is not the case, the story was very lackluster."
38,3,0.8714,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","I want to give this game a neutral rating but I can't.  Yeah the visuals are great and they did a good job of getting that Alien movie feel, however, the gameplay got a little too repetitive."
39,3,0.87,"really, feel, make, well, much, gameplay, great, alien, story, thing","Just finished the game because when I first played it, it was terrifying which is around the first 4 hours.
First off atmosphere, it is amazing. It really immersed me into the game, the sounds and environments really add to this too and they are by far the best part of the game.
The graphics also still hold up to this day in my opinion, the game still looks really good, especially the Alien however...

This game overstays its welcome for waaaay too long, the last 8-10 hours are awful and the entire time I was just nothing but mad and annoyed, because of many things biggest offenders being: Your Arsenal, mainly the flamethrower literally removes all tension from the game when you can just blast the Alien away as soon as you see it. The pacing is pretty bad too because it goes from slow tension filled  build up in the first half of the game to FUCKING RAMBO, *EXPLOSIONS* *GUNSHOTS*  ALIENS EVERYWHERE GOTTA FIGHT EM ALL OFF!
Yeah as you could probably guess the last half of the game is mainly where my a lot of hate comes from.

Overall I give the game a 4/10, Looks really good and immerses you in the first half/4 hours of the game, but after that it just overstays its welcome by prolonging the game for no bloody reason"

If you want to get over an obstacle, say a waist high railing that is blocking your way across the room, you do not press the jump-button. Because there is no jump-button. A simple railing that any reasonably sized adult human would mount easily, will block your progress completely and again you have to find something that is flashing, say an object or a terminal and press ""E"".

After 1 hour of playing the game, I encountered first NPCs. You listen to what they have to say and then you follow them, walking in darkly lit corridors. And after the NPC has reached a certain point in the level that triggers a new event, you can again press ""E"".

After that, I encountered first hostile NPCs with guns. They started to shoot at me. The other friendly NPC stated that I should again press ""E"", but I did not want to. I stood motionless in the middle of the corridor. After a minute of Stormtrooper worthy shooting and scripted AI movement, I finally died, quit the game and uninstalled it.
