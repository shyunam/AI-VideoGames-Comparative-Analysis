Ingredients:
1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

The episodic structure keeps the game dynamic and engaging, with scope for more and more to come. Contract events add a real life feel from the world of an assassin.

23,2,0.8411,"mission, level, way, target, many, map, challenge, kill, complete, take","10/10

Rather than following a linear storyline like Hitman: Absolution, Hitman (2016) gives you a number of locations (all of which are relatively large and very detailed) that you can re-visit at any time allowing you to perform the assassinations in a number of different ways. There are a number of 'opportunities' and 'challenges' for each location which essentially tell you what to do, making Hitman (2016) a lot less challenging than Hitman: Absolution (although you don't have to use these if you prefer a challenge). The graphics are very good and the game performs well, even at higher resolutions."
24,2,0.84,"mission, level, way, target, many, map, challenge, kill, complete, take","It takes a while to get used to, especially if you haven't played Hitman games before (which I hadn't). 

The campaign is very short, but the ability to replay the missions with different storylines and contracts is interesting, and trying to figure out alternative ways to complete the mission by using the challenges is great. 

However it can get monotonous being in the same location each time."

If you play through each level once and finish the game you will find it shallow and uninteresting.  This game was meant to have every level played over and over, not until you find the one solution, trial-and-error type of game, but until you find EVERY solution.  Every one of the dozens of ways you have to expire your target.  Every side story, every character and how they interact.  Each level is a large mechanical clock of moving parts and you will find the most enjoyment if you take the time to get to know each one.  You are rewarded for it too, more weapons, entry points, disguises.  If you are the type to enjoy replayability this is the very definition."
28,2,0.8275,"mission, level, way, target, many, map, challenge, kill, complete, take","Beforehand:
This game is free but contains an episodic purchase model. If you were confused like i was I would recommend buying the ""Game of the Year"" Edition as it removes the confusing episodic business model they used. Buying this will give you all the missions (including the bonus campaign) and some GOTY bonuses. This game is free, but this ""free"" version acts more as a tutorial or demo, providing you with a small campaign level meant to simulate what the rest of the game offers. If you are considering buying the game, downloading the ""free"" aspect will provide you with a solid idea of what the game has to offer, nothing more, nothing less. This game features an always-online system, however it isnt required to play. The online mode allows progress from challenges amongst other things. Everything main-game related is playable offline, but progress will not be saved (excluding mission completion). This side is incredibly frustrating, as replayability and progression (outside of unlocking the next mission so to speak, is entirely tied to the online servers, which means when they are down, so is the ability to complete challenges and unlock new things). This is imo the only critical flaw in the game.

Info Regarding the Gameplay:
This game requires you to play in a stealthy manner, playing ""loud"" will 99.9% of the time result in your death or the mission taking an extra 4h to complete. Heavy weaponry such as Snipers are practical as they can be used steathily. Other suppressed weaponry such as SMG's are also available but their usefulness can often be overshadowed by the basic suppressed and concealable sidearms. The game does feature loud weaponry but this is practically useless as it only makes things drastically harder. Unlike suppressed weaponry there are basically no incentives to bring these along. The game features 5 main missions. Technically 6 if you include the free mission present in the base game. These missions take place on a large, very, very detailed map and these 5 maps will be the foundation for 99% of the game. Just about everything you do in Hitman will be done in the same maps, within the same mission. Every map will include targets that the player must eliminate, how they do so is up to them. The missions are large sandboxes that include everything the player could potentially need to carry out the assassinations. By default, you have access to a silenced pistol and other equiptment but as you explore more of each map, more and more tools will reveal themselves, and in doing so, more ways to elimate your targets. This can be both direct and indirect. The gameplay presented in hitman runs fluidy and features virtually no bugs or glitches. The controls and overall design is well executed and has minimal flaws.

Replay Value:
Depending on how you decide to play this game can last you either ~6h or 100h+. The replay value is why you see players with hundreds, if not thousand of hours. Currently im only scratching the surface of the game (~20h), but have completed the base missions and begun to complete the gut of the game. This game's greatest aspect is its attention to detail. Every single mission has an incredible number of ways to elimate your target. Your 1st, 2nd and 500th playthrough of each mission will be the same everytime, same tools, same map. The only thing that can change depending on the player is the planning. This involves the player choosing their weaponry from guns to poisons to explosives, its all done beforehand. Everything you want on-hand or prepared beforehand is done here. Everything that happens after preparation is a direct result of a players action, this can be both unintentional or intentional.
Once you have completed each mission challenges will prevent themselves, these are basically new ways the game suggests you should try completing that same mission. On your first attempt you may have disguised yourself as a soldier and walked right up to the target and shot them. As an example challenge the game may want you to kill that same target with a knife while disguised as a clown. The way you approach the game changes. As you complete the challenges you are awarded mastery EXP, which basically translates into new equiptment you can add to your arsenal. This includes new weaponry, gadgets and so on. Depending on how you play and what challenges you attempt, a number of challenges can be completed in a single mission's playthrough. In others, they may require another separate playthrough to complete it.
Another option to the player is ""Professional Mode"". Basically this is just a harder version of that same mission that includes a few changes. Such as another security camera here, another guard here. Pathing and Ai changes and general improvements to make the game more realistic. Like the regular difficulty, this mode also includes a host of challenges that an individual may wish to attempt. Escalations are also available to the player, These are practically random playlists that ask the player to complete a set of assassinations in a consecutive fashion. After each assassination a new challenge, requirement or restriction may be added to increase the difficulty.
As for community content, contracts are also available. Contracts are missions designed by the hitman community. The user picks the targets and can change some of the rules to drastically alter the mission. The authors tools are simple, but effective. For the players they can choose these contracts and load them like any other mission. The only difference in gameplay is the requirements/targets imposed by the authors.

Final thoughts:
This game features a large amount of surface level enjoyment and content. For the more determined, returning players the bulk of the enjoyment and content is still available and is extremely rewarding. As i stated earlier, i am yet to complete over 80% of what the game has to offer, but have played enough to know what awaits for me. IO's attention to detail is incredible. If you see something and get an idea, chances are you'll be able to turn that idea into a reality. This game is virtually glitchless and i am yet to encounter a gamebreaking bug or crash. Everything from the controls, to the graphics, to the ai function fluidly and beautifully which is an incredible feat. I was completely new to the franchise and now im looking to preordering Hitman 2. If you are still unsure whether or not you will enjoy this game, download the ""free"" version, even the free mission shares the same attention to detail and design as the expansion missions. For your first playthrough's i recommend NOT watching guides or tutorials, excluding the game's tutorial mission. This will allow you to play your way, explore your options and find the games obvious and not-so-obvious details present in each mission. Your first playthrough will take time and may seem difficult but will be rewarding in the long run."
